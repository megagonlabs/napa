Indeed, everything is meant to be shared, and everyone is having a good time.\nA mound of house-made potato chips layered with thin slices of jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico is a fitting start, before piling the table with heartier dishes like meltingly tender tripe slow-braised with tomatoes and morcilla.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a huge modern bar filled with beautiful bouquets giving the restaurant a delightful ambiance. Our server was Hillary and she went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our entire dining experience. Chef has been cooking in fine dining for many years and you can taste his passion in all of his food. A  crowd favorite is the house made chips, sliced Iberico definitely a must try when visiting. My favorite last night was of course their Croquetas de gallina these have to be hands down the best croquetas I've had in a while if not ever! Every single dish just got better and better. Can't wait to go back and enjoy more of his delicious magical dishes!\nDishes I highly recommend:\nPALETA IBERICO CON CHIPS house made chips, sliced Iberico\nMORCILLA CON MANZANA\nBROTXETAS DE PULPO octopus, pear, salsa bravas\nARROZ CON NAVAJAS rice with razor clams\nCARILLERA DE BUEY braised beef cheek, potato puree\nBACALAO A LA VIZCAINA salt cod, pepper sauce\nTORTILLA CON SOBRASADA\nCroquetas de gallina\nTORRIJAS, TOCINO DEL CIELO", "I give Ernesto 4.5. Came on a Friday evening on a whim and asked for a table for two and waited maybe 10 minutes.  The drinks and wine were great. I had a Sun and rising.\n\nFood:\nTostas de gamba are bomb! So good. The shrimp are toasty and the bread is amazing. Had to order a second order.\n\nPan de tomate con confie de pato:  the duck was great! Personally the pan was underwhelming but the duck makes it.  \n\nTortilla w jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico and caviar: amazing! It's an open style Spanish omelette. The ham is fresh and the mix of flavors is satisfying.\n\nThe ambiance is loudish and they are checking for vaccination cards. Waiter was attentive and helpful.", "Review in consideration of Covid- food was great- delicious, in fact. Our waitress was very helpful, attentive, and kind. Only complaint - and its major as it is your absolute first impression of a restaurant - but the hostess was incredibly arrogant and rude. Perhaps expected at a \"hot spot\" restaurant on a crowded night in manhattan but it was 615pm and the place was half empty. At least half of the 2 tops were empty and she went to seat us directly across from a table with a screaming toddler and I asked if we could move to the next table before she sat and us and she gave us a bs \"oh no, I have a 4 top coming in soon\" (it was a 2 top next to another empty 2 top). 10 mins later she sat another table of 2 at that table. She had a terrible vibe and attitude from the second we walked up. With the current atmosphere and understanding that everyone going to dine out is just looking to have a nice, casual experience her actions were completely uncalled for and the management should teach her better. No one is paying a 22% included surcharge to deal with her superiority complex. She obviously needs an education.", "I was excited to go for the first time. It's newly open near the neighborhood in a quite residential neighborhood.  The ambience and decor is an A.  Flower arrangement by the door is beautiful.  However . I might have too much expectations. The food is all very salty and flavor is inconsistent throughout.   We tried several dishes ranging from appetizer to full meals including, homemade meatballs, iberico with homemade chips, bake crab in a dish, razor clams, kinderhook lamb chops and iberico pork collar.  The iberico with homemade chip is a new try but the combination doesn't work well together and all too salty.   The Arroz Con Navajos (razer clam) is basically  a rice dish with clam meat and the taste was so-so.  The main dish lamp chop is a bit dry with their sauce.  The iberico pork collar outer layer is glazed over boil pork with sauce- doesn't feel like the combination is well put together.  Ambience is beautiful.", "Very good! New spot in the \"Two Bridges\" neighborhood. This place was on a Monday night, so expecting that momentum to keep up for quite a bit. The space is gorgeous, very stylistic from the large marble bar to the orange orchids discretely stacked up to the ceiling. We started with the ever popular house made chips with sliced Iberico. Do get it! It's a delicious mix that you'll think about long after you leave. My favorite was the salt cod, it was cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce on top balanced the salty. The croquettes were super tasty, so much so we had to order more! Best croquettes I've had. The mushrooms were good as well but not blown away by them. Will definitely return to try more things on the menu. The location and sleek decor will make this place a hot spot by the Summer for sure.", "Wow I was very impressed with the food and service at this basque Spanish tapas bar and restaurant.  We went on a Tuesday evening and were able to snag 2 seats at the bar. The restaurant was packed indoor/outdoor seating as well as the bar.  Kristen and Sarah were behind the bar and very friendly as well as knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. Everything we ordered was incredible - the pulpo, croquetas, shrimp bikini and mushrooms mac and cheese. Definitely will be returning soon.", "Delightful shop.

Inside, red booths are equipped with little TV screens displaying the specials, but regulars already know what they\u2019re here for. Dumplings, of course, and the menu offers a dizzying number of these steamed and fried parcels.

My fave was the spicy beef, and my friend's was the pork soup dumpling (which is saying something because he has been to Shanghai and these are his favorite). The pan fried dumplings were amazing, though would recommend getting some orders fried and some boiled so you don't get a stomach ache from too much oil!\n\nMy least favorite was the duck and mushrooms, but probably because I am not a huge mushroom person. The green squash & lamb and pork & heritage egg were decent, though I would try different ones next time. The eight treasures and pear dumpling was interesting, tasted mostly like peanuts.\n\nDan dan noodles were disappointing (but a decent portion of noodles for $6, just not enough meat or flavor), but $2 hot and sour soup was good. But just eat all the dumplings you can.\n\nThis is located inside a dingy mall, so kinda feels weird when you get there, but the booths feel nice and private so causes the dingy mall feeling to go away.\n\nNote: We ordered way too much because it all looked so good, so definitely go with a group. Think two dumpling orders per person is enough for a meal.", "Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. Lots of waitstaff that were friendly and courteous. I found the menu a little overwhelming with so many selections (tip: review the entire menu before making selections as you'll end up backtracking and wanting everything).\nThe lighting was a lovely harsh white fluorescent but decor was warm yet sterile....white fixtures with red accents. I loved the booths along the back wall. Not a large restaurant but spacious.  I appreciate the wide variety but was way too much for a small restaurant. We had about 4 different types of dumplings and an order of the soup dumplings.  Don't get the soup dumplings...they lacked soup. Stick with what they're known for, the dumplings. While they were tasty, they were quite expensive. Like what the other reviews said, great place to take out of town people without the hole in the wall feel and certainly paying for it. Otherwise, I'll stick to my small and cheaper places.  Worth the try but can't afford to return.", "The distance between Citi Field and Dumpling Galaxy varies wildly depending on whether or not it's over 90 degrees, you have your father with a bad back in tow and are currently on Tashkent time.\n\nNone of these difficulties could keep my part of four from the restaurant, which is tucked in the back of a new mall in a corner of Flushing's Chinatown. Now while the huge variety of dumplings has led in part to fawning press in the New York Times and elsewhere, it's actually not in service of the first time dinner. There are so many different kinds to choose from, with traditional options mixed in with more elaborate creations. Frankly, neither the Chinese nor the English menu were particularly good in helping us figure out what to order, so I chose more or less at random with a few dishes.\n\nThe crispy potstickers, connected at the top in an order, were a highlight, as were the lamp. Shrimp dumplings missed out on the plump simplicity of the best har gow, and a vegetable dish was a nice substitution.\n\nI'm sure this place is a mob scene around lunch, but at 4 p.m. on a Sunday we were on the only people around. It was worth the trek.", "This place has the best dumplings by far. I decided to try this place because of the many vegetarian dumplings they offer. The food is AMAZING!!! Everything from the dumplings to the dipping sauce is made fresh and tastes so flavor and fresh. We tried six different vegetarian dumplings and they were all so delicious. It was hard to decide which were our favorite. The owner came out to talk to I and was the nicest person. She even offered to make us some special dumplings that were not on the menu, which we took her up on and so happy we did. Already made plans with friends to go back and try the rest of their veggie dumpling and the chocolate dumpling for dessert. I highly recommend this place.", "Went there today and found out that Dumpling Galaxy is closed ... not like, 'it's Sunday and they're closed', more like it's PERMANENTLY closed.

Tried calling the restaurant before I went but phone just rang and rang. Oh well, off to find another spot to eat at.", "Went here on a food tour of Queens, and it was honestly very good!

The crab is cooked perfectly and the salt and pepper and garlic and whatever other spices they put in it was delicious! You can't help but lick your fingers. We also got a couple of other items that I enjoyed. We got the clam in a spicy hot sauce and it was SO good! I thought the crab was good, but this was by far my favorite dish of the night. The jalapeno and basil sauce was so addicting and I ate it with my rice when we ran out of clams. We also got Hong Kong style noodles which were decent - nothing special there.

It was already seasoned before the salt and pepper dip and even for my American taste buds I found it awfully salty. The Fried Noodle was just okay...not worth $14+ and the seafood accommodation was not very plentiful either. Seemed more like free bread but you pay for the butter type thing.\n\nTotal was just under $70 after tip and the service was just alright.

Head to the roomy bar for a more typical perch from which to enjoy the great Spanish art of small-plate dining.\nThe kitchen may offer some of the usual favorites, but the real emphasis is on Galician regional specialties.

First, the restaurant has a cool vibe, but the cuisine is very traditional and authentic... and of superb quality.\n\nOne thing that happens upon mentioning Galicia to other Spaniards is that immediately they acknowledge how well they eat there. There are lots of things to try including pulpo al gallego - octopus with chili - which is the regional dish of Galicia. The extensive amounts of coastline means that the delicious seafood can't be ignored, but raxo (fried potatoes and pork loin) and tarta de Santiago (almond cake) are also fantastic. Some of the best Spanish wines also originate from this region, for example Ribeira Sacra, as well as the stunning licor caf\u00e9.\n\nIts cuisine is one of the main tourist attractions of Galicia: the exquisite delicacies of this region are based on the high quality and variety of the local products used in the preparation of dishes. Country, farm and sea products are unique in their characteristics and quality. Furthermore, it cannot be forgotten that one of the main pillars of Galician cooking is the professionalism of its experts. Galician chefs are found world-wide.\n\nThe service was fantastic... this is a must while in nyc.

In fact, I've been to Betanzos many times for the tortilla, and this one is right up there. I've had many huevos rotos con zorza before too. This one was excellent, too. My only complaint is that I also know what all of this costs back in Galicia. A glass of Estrella Galicia is $2.50 at most, if not $1.75. $8.50 at Tomi\u00f1o is a lot even for NYC (Estella Galicia isn't an ipa either), and they don't offer you a pincho, which is typically offered at most tabernas in Galicia - a small amount of callaos or alb\u00f3ndigas with your drink. $10 for the size of tortilla they give you here is on the very expensive side. It's a snack. $18.50 for a beer and a snack is a ton. Please Tomi\u00f1o, get creative with specials or happy hour so that I can rationalize going back. These things won't lower the perceived value of the overall place; they'll encourage more people to try the food and beer and maybe then consider the full menu.", "Tomi\u00f1o Taberna Gallega exceeded our expectation.

Begin with such harmonious starters as roasted red beets served chilled along with red quinoa, sweet blackberries and pumpkin seed butter. Roasted cauliflower, brushed with a black garlic spread atop a sunflower seed crumble and a warm buttermilk sauce, is given a new lease on life. And, namelaka, a light chocolate pudding dusted with cucumber snow, steals the show.", "yelp_reviews": ["For those intrigued by Jordan Kahn's Vespertine -- an imposing structure with a curvy orange exoskeleton -- Destroyer offers a window into the chef's aesthetic at a fraction of the price tag. Where the wavy building invites curiosity, Destroyer's minimal facade risks being missed. Within, things are similarly spartan, which allows you to focus exclusively on the food. What impresses you as a (dare I say) basic menu of overnight oats, avocado toast, and chicken confit proves complex as your food arrives. Plating and preparation subvert your expectations, as you are met with horseradish cream presented like cotija cheese, almond milk served as a frozen disk in your porridge, and micro-greens everywhere.

Such a hidden gem too in a really industrial but artsy area.\n\nThe owner here also owns Vespertine which is a culinary experience right across the street.\n\nThe plates are very along the lines of molecular gastronomy and contemporary playing styles. All delivering such wonderful tastes that are true to nature.\n\nWe tried the oats and almond yogurt, which was amazing and was a take on overnight oats with a almond yogurt patty on top. Nice fresh and filling. There's also some red current lightly tucked in there giving the dish a nice pink look once you get further down the bowl.\n\nAlso we got the avocado toast which was nice and earthy. The avocado was deconstructed with burnt onions on top and kale oil that tasted so whole and earthy, wow!\n\nFinally we also got the chicken confit which was a beautiful, warm and hearty meal full of flavor! All these dishes were so filling and light so we didn't feel greasy or bloated after.\n\nHighly recommend this place and Robin who is the executive on hand is amazing.

Why yes. Wow. This place easily exceeded any expectations.\n\nThe beef brisket had different complementing elements. From the tanginess of the yogurt, pungent crunchiness of the the garlic and tender brisket. It just went well together.\n\nThe avocado with the burnt onion dusted on topped, bathed in oil and seeds.

The cultured butter had a nice level of saltiness and a light creaminess.\n\n+ ORGANIC HEN EGG WITH CRISPY POTATO AND MUSHROOMS: Wow, this dish was beautiful. It looked like it could belong in a museum of modern art. I liked the \"stone bowl\" concept, where you could still hear the dish crackling and cooking as it was served to you. The mushrooms had a surprising sour note (not in a bad way), that was mellowed out by the egg yolk.\n\n+ AVOCADO CONFIT: Served with slices of country bread, this was an interesting DIY rendition of an avocado toast. I loved the elegant presentation and the fact that you could determine how much avocado to put on the toast.", "Ordered the Avocado confit.

We ordered the poke, camden toast, sausage rolls, potato hash, and the Scottish egg... oh be still my heart. Wonderous and flavorful, the appetizers were hearty with typical British flare, but made with farm to fork bounty. The apps were followed by the prime rib, chicken, and gnocchi. The gnocchi was laden with a rich cream sauce, fresh peas, and dill. I could have licked the bowl. The chicken is an elevated rotisserie that you should have! Juicy and full of delightful flavor.. Make room for the cheesecake and sorbet which was accompanied by this granola! We asked if we could buy the granola, it was THAT good.

On our previous visit for dinner we were not really impressed, but last night changed everything.  The service was professional,  friendly and attentive.  The ceasar salad was delicious.  We especially liked the different \"twist\" the salad had. They use mustard in the dressing as well as a soft cooked egg and pardons. We are very particular when it comes to a Ceasar, and it was outstanding. It also had white anchovies.  The prime rib, small portion,  was cooked to a perfect medium rare with excellent crispy edges.\nWhat stands out about the whole dining experience is how they handled an imperfection in the pork chop. Because of the spit roasting,  it was more well cooked then my husband prefers. No questions  asked, they immediately removed the chop and changed his order to prime rib. The whole process took less than 5 minutes!  Then, they refused to charge us for that entree.  We have found very few restaurants who would have handled that situation in that manner. We will definitely return.", "This is such a gem to downtown Sacramento. Great place for something business casual, special occasion, or even a cute little date!

Downside though, more people want to eat here so the wait time can get up to 2hr or more!\n\nAlso, it is a pretty pricey place to eat if you're on a budget. So I would suggest you come for their lunch specials! The lunch specials come with your choice of rice, brown rice or friend rice. What a steal! Not too many Chinese places give you the option for brown rice or fried rice without an extra cost!\n\nYou can then pick your entree options which includes the walnut shrimp! There is also a small salad, an egg roll and a small bowl of soup served with this meal. Not to mention the orange slice and the fortune cookie at the end! This whole plate will cost you around $10!

The food is more Chinese American but they definitely have some more authentic dishes. Service is great and prices are reasonable\n\nWe ordered several dishes as we were a group of 8. We started off with a large double skin appetizer. Its basically a mixture of flat clear noodles, meat, seafood, and veggies and comes with a mustard heavy sauce. They bring everything separately and mix it at your table. If you are not a huge mustard fan I would recommend asking them to not put all of the mustard sauce in.\n\nOther things we got were black bean fish, garlic ong choy, kung pao chicken, beef with green beans, twice cooked pork, cashew shrimp, and shredded pork+bean curd. I personally think the highlight for me was the twice cooked pork. So fatty but do delicious with the right kick of spiciness!\n\nPro tip: If you pay with cash on a large meal they give you free ice cream. We asked for soup instead and they gave us a huge bowl of delicious hot and sour! It was enough to provide each of us with two bowls of soup. It's definitely worth it to bring cash with large parties!", "Review based on three visits to the new(er) location.  Yes the other reviewers are correct, there always is a line at peak hours including lunch, but it is worth the wait.\n\nDishes I have had that I thought were excellent include the Peking duck, carved off the bone with crispy skin included, tea smoked duck served on the bone with hoisin and steamed buns, west lake minced beef soup with egg, sauteed baby bok choy and shitake mushrooms, honey walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, spring rolls, and  zha jiang mien.  Pretty much everything is great here.  Also portions tend to be large and hence I think the pricing is very reasonable.\n\nThe dining room is fairly large with several of those round tables equipped with lazy susans so you can eat family style.

Only knock might be the limited beer and wine choices, but come here for the fantastic food and do your wine tasting elsewhere.", "Great China is pretty great! I ordered the Sweet and Sour Pork lunch special, and the flavor was bold and really good. The food is authentic enough, but also has a somewhat Westernized touch that's not bad. Though this is a place not as affordable for most Berkeley students to eat on a consistent basis, I think it's a good place if you want to treat yourself and you're craving Chinese food. Otherwise, I think it's pretty appropriate for families too, since there is plentiful seating and the ambiance is bright and busy. There is a bit of noise as it's a bustling restaurant, and the street parking outside is all metered. It can be hard to find parking overall though, especially during peak meal hours. Though I'm excited to try something else next time, like the Peking duck I've heard so much about, I personally don't think I'm going back very soon as the location (bottom Southwest of Berkeley campus) is very inconvenient for the average student and students don't really pass by the area unless they live nearby.", "This is a great spot for more authentic restaurant style Chinese food than a normal take out place, which I don't see much of anyway in the bay area. Plates can be decently expensive, between 10-15 but I've come to realize that buying two plates can be more than enough, with leftovers, for 2 people. The food is great quality and comes in large servings. The place is also large enough for small to large parties, so have no issue bringing a crowd.\n\nSpeaking of crowds, the place is popular and does get crowded so be aware of that. It usually isn't too bad but can be a solid hour wait if you come at the peak time. You can also order food to go and that doesn't take as long. Service is decent so people get in and out of the place in a timely manner. My only issue is how the food is brought to the table. I've noticed that sometimes servers will bring out food as its ready, instead of together. This isn't usually a bad thing, but it's tougher when you've got two complimentary dishes that you'd rather enjoy at the same time.

Not too strong and not too sweet.\n\nI am so happy we happened upon this place and will definitely be back soon.", "I would say this is a mix of ABC Kitchen and Perry St. Since they reopened the doors style wise. They had classic JG dishes but modernized. I think it's a bit to hip for the UES. Smaller menu nothing super special of it, we ordered the duck and the lobster tastes really good, no doubt you can tell it was a Jean George restaurant, but didn't feel has high hopes as all the other restaurants. Not really elegant or Michelin feeling at all. Is definitely say try it out but it's not a must go to.

The interior is warm and welcoming but contemporary at the same time. The real surprise is the backyard which is lushly planted with trees and bushes and explains why the place is called Faun.\n\nThe menu is very imaginative and includes starters like peppers filled with blue crab. Given where the chef worked before, this is no surprise. The main dishes of ribs and steak were very tender and satisfying. The menu is concise with a focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients.  The wine list is eclectic and features many delights from Greece.\n\nOverall this is a very welcoming neighborhood restaurant with great food and wine and we are looking forward to coming back soon.", "Faun has some lovely qualities, which I'll start with. The service is excellent, attentive and fast. It's a small, intimate dining spot with warm, inviting decor, esp nice in winter. That outdoor space is going to be great in the summer.\nThe food is better than good. Order the beet salad, they do it right. The entrees were quite delicious (pumpkin tortelli & quadrucci) and flavorful. dessert was the chocolate torte and perfectly rich topped with crispy black sesame seeds/blood oranges/amaretto.\n\nImprovements must begin with portion size!! I'm not a person that needs a huge plate of food to be satiated, but the SMALL entree portions were absolutely LAUGHABLE. we actually laughed when plates were presented. 3 tortelli (basically ravioli) at that price does not make an entree. maybe an appetizer at most.\n\nbecause the space is small and the kitchen is situated in the middle, guests are literally being seasoned, coated, spritzed, peppered and covered in whatever dish is on the grill. i still smell like fish hours later, as do my clothes. so that was overwhelming and eye-watering at times.\n\nmaybe i'll go back in the summer and sit outside, but it's unlikely i'll dine inside for dinner again.", "4.5 stars, but rounding up because we dined here a few days after dining at the ever-hyped Lilia in Williamsburg (which was not so good). And this place restored my faith in great Italian food.\n\nThere's something to be said about a warm and charming \"neighborhood\" restaurant that consistently overachieves on food. The menu seems to change pretty frequently so maybe I won't focus as much on the food.\n\nBut picture this... a 10-year old girl in the restaurant gnawing on a pork bone, having devoured the same a few minutes earlier. So precious... and so good. It just warmed my heart.\n\nBut back to the food, I'd say the chicken liver mousse is as good as it gets, the pasta dishes are above average for NYC (and that's saying something), the fish and pork entrees we had were stellar, and we had an olive oil cake that made my life complete.\n\nWhat can I say... I like this place.", "I had a very disappointing experience at Faun this past weekend. I had a reservation for 915 and arrive on time. The host initially told me my table was just finishing up and that I would be seated shortly. But after awhile I was encouraged to sit at the bar and then order an entree and then my entire meal while I waited. I was finally seated almost one hour later. Unfortunately when my food arrived it was luke warm. I understand  a restaurant can get 'in the weeds' but when that has such a severe effect on diners I expect them to make some type of amends. An offer for a free dessert or cocktail? Nothing was offered. When I left the staff thanked me for coming but never offered an apology for the wait. There seemed to be a general exhaustion among the entire staff. It makes me wonder if they've bitten off more than they can chew. I can imagine having a positive experience at this restaurant when they are not overwhelmed. Based on my experience I'd recommend avoiding weekend nights.", "Randomly walked in to this cute little spot on Vanderbilt avenue and I can say I have found my new hangout in the area. The small corner bar is ideal for tasting and indulging in the interesting wine list with wines from all over the place. Try out the Greek ones (I'm from Greece so I'm impartial to them). Tried out the spaghetti with artichoke and bottarga and absolutely delighted by uniqueness of flavors and the freshness of ingredients (pasta is made in house).\nService was prompt and responsive, as well as helpful with any questions and menu recommendations.\nDefinitely coming back again and again and again...", "Nice quaint restaurant in Prospect Heights on Vanderbilt. A friend recommended this restaurant. The pasta dish I had was good also very fresh you can definitely tell they make their own pasta and sauces. The pate dish my had was good and I usually hate pate so the chef did a good job on that. This is kind of expensive not cheap. A wait for a table on a Friday night is long but you can sit at the bar and order food.", "Came here for my partner's birthday and we really enjoyed it! We got recommendations for the pasta with the squid and we both really liked that and the recommended red that paired with it. I had the lamb pappardelle, I liked it but not as much as the squid pasta. We had the coffee pana cotta dessert and it was delicious.\n\nI also respect the owner's mission to provide a living wage and especially ensuring back of the house workers are able to earn their fair amounts as front of the house staff.

Great french food, beer and wine in a beautiful setting.  Love the warm lighting and ambience of L'antagoniste.  I had the best Chardonnay I've ever tasted, as well as the oysters!  If available, the oysters are a must try. We ordered several dishes to share and taste.  The salad with sorbet dressing was fresh with an awesome dressing, simply amazing! The duck a la orange was divine- tender duck, creamy mash potatoes, perfect flavoring.  The souffl\u00e9 was light, fluffy and delicious.  The desert is a must.  Amazing chocolate cake and Paris Brest.

Always an amazing experience, with delicious food and libations!  Go if you haven't!  NOW!", "Came here on Thanksgiving with a few friends and left disappointed.  I went with souffl\u00e9, turkey, and pumpkin sorbet from the prefix menu.  Souffl\u00e9 was bland.  Turkey came out cold.  You would expect some sweetness in a sorbet.  The only thing we enjoyed was the pumpkin tart that one of my friends ordered.\n\nThe host greeted us warmly, but it stops from there.  Our waiter was clueless.  He brought out everyone's appetizer except for my souffl\u00e9.  His excuse was that the kitchen was backed up.  Keep in mind that my friend ordered a souffl\u00e9 as well.  So I started my stop watch (on my iPhone) and it came out 12 minutes later.  I knew he brought it to the wrong table so I had to call him out.  He blamed the kitchen and said they only saw 1 souffl\u00e9 on the ticket.  He didn't even instruct us on what to do with the spoon of creme fraiche.  At least he was good at pointing his finger.  Meanwhile another waiter was dropping and breaking plates on the floor.  I guess you can say the service was consistent.  Wished we just stayed in the city instead of wasting our time traveling to this mediocre restaurant.  \n\nAfter writing this review, I read online a similar review from the Daily News written earlier this year:\n\nnydailynews.com/life-sty\u2026", "Cozy French neighborhood bistro that makes you feel at home. The owner Amadeus is usually there and goes out of his way to make you comfortable. Maya is the sommelier and since we are usually in right when they open is waiting on us. Her wine recs have always exceeded our expectations. We usually dine with our 11 month old baby who sometimes needs extra attention. Maya has even helped us with the baby while we finished our last bites.\n\nThe food is very good. We usually start with oysters which are very fresh and served with a classic mignonette. Last night we has the appetizer on special which was bone marrow, fried frog legs, escargot and black garlic. We completed by our meal sharing the Contre Filet (12 oz dry aged NY strip steak) and Roasted Hen of the Woods. All pictured here so you can SEE how delicious it was. I would really recommend anything on their menu but these in particular if you catch them on the menu get them. You won't regret it.", "Wow, this place is absolutely amazing. We came here for brunch on a Saturday morning and found that it was strangely empty. The inside has really interesting decor. Being that it is a French restaurant, I was kind of surprised that the atmosphere was more casual than its menu led on.\n\nWe ordered the eggs Benedict and the duck hash with duck egg. The eggs Benedict was really good. I think I had to tell myself to look past the fact that the hollandaise sauce was pink instead of yellow, but it was truly delicious. The duck hash was really good. It was tasty and flavorful, and kept me full for the rest of the day.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Our waiter did a great job with addressing any concerns we had with the menu. Will definitely visit here again.", "Excellent decor, friendly service, perfectly executed food. The cheese souffle was light and airy.

My favorite out of the three was the spring onion pancakes which came with a pickled onion dipping sauce which was good.\n\nThe main dish, beef short rib with pickled radishes and ssam vegetables (lettuce wrap for the beef) was very impressive.

First bite was so good I wanted to jump up and dance around the restaurant. This dish like everything we had, is elevated Korean bbq. Distinctive, garden fresh hand-selected lettuces used to wrap  homemade pickled daikon a little sauce that was impeccably complimentary and perfectly seasoned, luscious sous vide short rib that is completely out of this world.\n\nThe people working here are great. Multiple people came by to chat with us and everyone was delightful, friendly and the service was flawless. This is saying a lot because the restaurant was full and they are in soft-opening mode.

But you're paying for celeb chef dishes and gorgeous waterfront views.\n\nThe two-level restaurant serves super fresh fruits de mer like the delectable Sashimi with Spicy White Ponzu (containing a cornucopia of raw fish delights), a Maine Crab Roll and Crispy Fish Tacos. I loved my sashimi, but my friend didn't really care for her tacos (and our other friend was just a-okay with her roll). However, the drinks made up for that by being the perfect fruity, fizzy concoctions one needs for a Sunday hangover brunch. I'd recommend the lovely Raspberry-Lychee Bellini and the Purple Peartini.", "Twas a chilly evening next to the drafty window.  I draped my winter coat over my legs.  I had no idea there was another dining room one floor up.  The first floor dining room feels like the waiting area for the lively room with glorious views upstairs.  Downstairs in steerage, it's dark and the service is not good.  Some guests were dressed in t-shirts.  The staff, including the hostess, lacked energy and was inattentive.  Once entrees were dropped, our waiter disappeared.  Lobster was watery and tasteless, head-on prawns were tasteless.  Sashimi on ice was delicious though I don't agree with serving fish on ice.  Black Sea Bass was delicious.  Our view wasn't terrible but when I walked upstairs I was devastated.  The vibe upstairs was bright, glamorous and celebratory.  Me and my date were celebrating but for some reason we forgot to celebrate.  I couldn't wait to get out of there.", "The long awaited new addition to Pier 17, this new restaurant by Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten is not only a beautiful restaurant with stunning views of the Brooklyn bridge and the East River, but the food is absolutely delicious.

I would go back to the restaurant JUST for this delicious, refreshing, nutty, rich salad. We also HAD to try the macaroni and cheese, and it was to die for.

It may sound off-putting or too rich...but coming from a girl who steers clear of chocolate cake for that exact reason, the combination of the cake and the cream was GENIUS.\n\nNot only is the staff attentive and friendly and the food amazing, but the atmosphere itself is rustically intimate and inviting enough  to want to go back again and again.

It is a wine and cheese venue although there are many food options. I was alone so after being seated and ordering a glass of red wine [Badia e Coltobuono] I opted to order the pig's ass sandwich. I thought maybe it would be too much to eat and was hesitant to order anything else at that time. It arrived and it was just the right size and very filling. It came with a vat of mustard alongside which was very tasty. One thing I do like about it is that you can order a flight of cheeses each $7. If you order 6 you pay for 5 but the cheese person makes the decision for you and there are no substitutions. It is a great place to go with friends and to make a meal of wine and cheese. The waitstaff was very accommodating and I was told that if I wanted a flight of cheeses, there was someone there I could talk to and ask questions about my preferences. The restroom was clean, well maintained and handicap accessible. I would recommend and return.", "Wine, Cheese, Pine Nut Brittle, Brown Sugar Fudge  (seriously, this is CRACK), and Nutella Truffles. These are a few of my favorite things.  The wine and cheese selection here is sublime.  We chose the wine and let Jamie (aka. cheese whiz) do a cheese pairing and her choices were outstanding. Next, We noshed on the muffaletta and the short ribs.  Servings are not super huge but they are yummy. The pumpkin ice cream sandwich with cinnamon wafers and bourbon caramel sauce was truly a treat.\n\nBathed in warm neutrals, the place is intimate, dimly lit and the music is eclectic.  I heard everything from old school hip hop, to Enya-esque ambient spa music, and even some rock.  All of this was in the background and not intrusive at all (barely audible in fact).  The place is small and they do not accept reservations, but they sat us quickly.  They have typical wine bar prices so not cheap but definately worth a visit.  This place seems perfect for a romantic date, a get together with good friends or even a girlfriend outing.  The best thing about the place is the attire is super casual and the people are mature.

The goose breast reuben sandwich is sheer bliss, and you simply MUST get one of their flights of 3 cheeses. I've had great luck with the knowledgeable servers/bartenders.

Got there on a Sunday first thing and had the rooftop patio all to myself with the latin music to go with the sunshine.  I ordered the Smokehouse Appetizer with whitefish and a beautiful full-bodied Argentina Malbec. It comes on a eye-pleasing rustic cutting board with a simple but generous grilled croustini and a mound of their artisan whitefish salad. And you know it's housemade  when you dig in and find the gorgeous chunks of fish waiting to be slathered on the bread. It's a SYM (smack your mama) dish that makes you a bit sad when you're coming to the end. It's a perfect solo or shared plate although sharing might be tough.

He was super nice and answered all our questions with a few recommendations.\n\nTheir beer selection is good - lots of local beers on draft. We started with a couple of those, and they came quickly in nice icy glasses. For dinner, we had the smoked fish platter which is just to die for. Your selection of two toasted bagels with their candied salmon, traditional smoked salmon, smoked pepper salmon, smoked trout, and smoked white fish with chive cream cheese and an amazing horseradish sauce that I may have eaten with a spoon - don't judge me. We also shared three masa tacos with grilled shrimp - also solid, but probably wouldn't go out of my way for them.\n\nOverall a great experience all around - next time I'll try the wings!", "When I learned there was a fish market with affordable prices steps away from my apartment, I knew I had to check it out! They have a large selection of fresh fish as well as frozen, and extremely helpful staff members on hand ready to give recommendations and assist in any way possible. The prices are beyond reasonable and the selection is way above what you would find at your neighborhood grocery store.\n\nTheir in-house smoked salmon Indian Candy is their specialty, and I was not disappointed! The package may have mentioned that the piece was 2 servings, but that didn't stop me from devouring it all at once! Smoky with a hint of sweetness, this is going to be my new favorite snack. And at around $3 for a decent size piece, it certainly is not a decadent treat.\n\nI've heard the Tavern is now open with $1 oysters and a great local beer selection, so I am eager to try it out soon.

I'll start by saying I've never been that impressed by the cocktails.

The seafood is usually tasty, sometimes underwhelming, but overpriced across the board.

Fish and Chips: the fish was cooked excellently, super delicate. It's $16, but you get a lot of fish and lot of chips.  \n3. Smoked Salmon: fresh and delicious! comes with crunchy bread, capers, and some wonderful cream cheese.\n\nService and Atmosphere: Excellent.

The chopped bluefin otoro was a little tough, texture wasn't great (probably why it was chopped).\nWe also added on Sweet shrimp (the sweet shrimp was larger than I expected based on other sweet shrimp I've had but not as sweet) and they can fry the head or i think do a soup with the head. We also got the chawa mushi with fish and slow cooked beef tongue. I wasn't a huge fan of the chawa mushi (steamed egg), I think the fish made it a little too fishy. The slow cooked beef tongue was very tender and flavorful.", "Ok... I get it.  Ohshima's Omakase is definitely worth it.  The price for the omakase is a tad cheaper at $40 than other places, and definitely worth the splurge if you're in the area!\n\nWe came on a Saturday without reservations.  We got there about 15-20 minutes before opening and there was already a line for people with and without reservations.  Thankfully after 30 minutes we were seated.  In retrospect I probably wouldn't wait for a table again and try to get reservations.  (Thank you to all my Yelpers for your tips on reservations for my next visit!)\n\nService is very prompt and and friendly.  They have other specials on the menu, however, you can get that at any other Japanese restaurant.  They have a wide variety of sushi and even get some of their fish from Japan.  If I still lived in Orange County this would be my go-to sushi fix.", "One of the best sushi spots I've been to in OC. This is my 3rd time here (always Omakase) & I have never been disappointed. I love that they use a little touch of citrus pepper. I also always order the yellowtail collarbone on the side because it tastes notably different here & it's the best I've ever had. They are staffed with all Japanese sushi chefs. This restaurant is small, more intimate, & often busy with people waiting around for 30+ minutes so you definitely should make a reservation if you can or be prepared to potentially have to wait at least 1hr or +. There's a very small window to call in & make a reservations daily between about 5-530 pm. If you have a reservation they are pretty strict with time so be here within 15 minutes of your reservation otherwise you'll likely lose it. Omakase (chef's choice, seating at the bar) is where its at if you haven't experienced it & this is definitely a great place for Omakase if you're open to trying different things. They'll ask if there is anything you really don't prefer & they're very accommodating.\n\nOverall, this place takes a top spot for Sushi in OC. Great service. Fresh, consistent, quality authentic sushi restaurant.", "The gem of all gems when it comes to sushi in OC.  Seating is very limited (both table and sushi bar,) so if you've got a larger party, it would be ideal to call in and place a reservation.  They ONLY take reservation calls from 5:00-5:30pm, so be sure to have them on speed dial.\n\nHighly Recommended:\n-amber jack!!!\n-Spanish mackerel\n-crab handroll: no fillers, this handroll is STUFFED to the top with crabmeat\n-tamago: one of the best I've had\n\nGood eats:\n-hamachi and jalapeno cold appetizer\n-cherry salmon\n\nNOTE: They serve 'kanto' or Tokyo-style sushi rice, prepped with a blend of rice vinegar and Japanese sea salt that is served warm.  They glaze their sushi with special soy sauce or with sea salt and Yuzu to bring out the fresh, natural flavors of the seafood.  Extra soy sauce is not necessary (but still available upon request.)"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/ohshima-sushi-and-japanese-cuisine-orange-2?hrid=o2RWuc6nnbHQKJoN7PehTg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/ohshima-sushi-and-japanese-cuisine-orange-2?hrid=iZbeCO1CsTrzIeKiu5cgGw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/ohshima-sushi-and-japanese-cuisine-orange-2?hrid=n5aARSIMCgliqBlv48xojQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/ohshima-sushi-and-japanese-cuisine-orange-2?hrid=LKyLImuN4EXU7BTA1UlKow&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/ohshima-sushi-and-japanese-cuisine-orange-2?hrid=srV3z5NkWDwXczgOmsoK-w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/ohshima-sushi-and-japanese-cuisine-orange-2?hrid=pVIaxy142_B5HgH2TAZOoA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Taboon", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/taboon-new-york/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/taboon", "michelin_pov": "Taboon\u2019s namesake brick-walled, wood-fired oven is burning a bit brighter these days since Chef Efi Nahon has returned to Hell\u2019s Kitchen\u2019s finest Middle Eastern dining room.

Is it still great the 2nd and 3rd time? Is it consistently great with all its offerings?  Taboon delivers in all aspects.  \n\nThe food was magnificent.  We started with the sublime Blue Point oysters.  Never had any better.  That was followed by the Taboon trio of traditional cold meze offerings of baba ghanooj, hummus, and schoog (very hot Palestinian hot sauce).  We split the Taboon chopped salad and the Heraime (halibut cooked in a Taboon clay oven with a ragout of roasted pepper and tomato) which was fabulous.\n\nThis was our 4th or 5th visit to Taboon, and each time my wife orders the silan for dessert. It's a dish of vanilla ice cream topped with halvah and date sugar, pistachios--unbelievable mixture of textures and flavors. Look forward to this!\n\nFinally, the bread here is out of this world, crispy focaccia-like loaf that is brushed with olive oil and topped with a sprinkling of spices. You'll remember it long afterwards.\n\nIn short this was a fabulous meal fairly priced with pleasant decor and excellent waitress. Kudos to the chef, Efi Nahon and his staff.", "Go West, young man.  Really nice place with solid food and interesting cocktails.  One of the best meals you'll find on 10th avenue in Hell's Kitchen.  \n\nWalking one more avenue West to 10th seems hard for a lot of people used to just checking out what's on 9th avenue in HK.  However, I think that means a lot of people are missing out on a good meal at Taboon.  The atmosphere is very nice and low key with lots of candlelight and hardwood.\n\nFirst off, they make thier own wood fired bread that's amazing and comes with your meal.  Fresh, warm, and delicious.  They also have a decent list of interesting cocktails that has a little Mediteranian feel.  I highly recommend the one that has Ouzo in it I think called Kefe.\n\nThe food was excellent and I think a very good value.  I don't really think it's very pricey for the quality of the estabishment, but might appear high because it's on 10th avenue.  The staff was also quite nice, attentive, and offered good advice when deciding between food options.\n\nI'd highly recommend making the trek over to 10th to check this place out.", "I moved to Hell's Kitchen almost a year ago and have been wanting to try Taboon the whole time... I missed it twice on restaurant week and decided not to wait for friends to join; I went after work this past Tuesday for an early dinner alone.\n\nI have been missing out! I chose to sit at the bar, the bartenders were amazing and tentative! He recommended a Turkish red wine ($12/glass) which was delicious and not too dry. I received my complementary house bread (wow) and since I was sitting at the bar, they run a small plate happy hour from 5-7 during the week for $8 each. I ordered the 'Taboon Trio' with hummus, tzaziki and baba ganoush. Their hummus is so creamy and the baba ganoush was my favorite and my first experience trying it. I followed with the zucchini cakes (pictured) and the baked cauliflower (pictured). I had ordered the lamb sausage as well and was so full at this point I brought it home to enjoy during the week (it was magic).\n\nI missed out on the dessert menu but will be back and will force friends to come experience this with me!", "The same way that Pampano makes upscale Mexican food, or Kittichai makes upscale Thai food, Taboon makes upscale middle-eastern food - with the pleasant bonus that Taboon is warm and welcoming, and while it is stylish it has no attitude.  Everyone raves about the bread, and the falafel is equally good, as is the hummus.  The main courses are more refined, with lots of good fish dishes.  Another plus about this place is that you don't have to book weeks in advance to get a weekend dinner reservation.   The location is a bit off the beaten path, but this is a place I love returning to and a great date restaurant.", "Came here last night with my boyfriend. I had the scallops and the crab salad. I thought the scallops were really amazing. You could taste the butter that they were cooked in and I loved the crispy noodle and quail eggs on top. Pretty pricey though- two scallops for  $17. I also had the crab salad. I'm not sure how I feel about the combination of crab with feta cheese. However, I loved that there was no mayo and you could really taste the chunks of crab. The dish had lots of flavor. I also tried the trio of dips (hummus, tzaziki, red pepper spread which I thought was nothing special. The bread was delicious. Overall, I thought the dishes I tried had some interesting flavors but it was on the expensive side.", "I went to this place soon after it opened and haven't been back since, so my impressions are a little vague and may now be out of date.  But I've thought about going back often, especially since I've yet to find other cities that are as good for Middle Eastern food as NYC.  What I recall:  a somewhat oversized (and perhaps a leetle too bright) dining room, but still romantic with country-style furniture, wood and brick and candles everywhere; a whole fish perfectly roasted with a lightly salted, crispy skin, accompanied by various luscious meze, and, last but NOT least, warm, golden-browned, fluffy bread apparently baked in their taboon (i.e., oven), which comes drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with sea salt and herbs.  YUM!!!", "A lovely hideaway with great food in Hell's Kitchen.\n\nTaboon's meals are stellar and fresh. The salads and sides as well as the main courses are very tasty.

Dressed up with pale hues and a colorful bar, this remarkable menu offers a fresh take on the chef's signature Moroccan fare. As for the staff? They are (as always) gracious and well-informed.\nChef Lahlou is famous for weaving California staples into dishes with stunning results. Loyalists will be happy to know the iconic specialty, Basteeya, remains\u2014with golden phyllo wrapped around a delicious mix of shredded chicken and spiced almonds. Other staples include the slow-roasted, bone-in chicken thigh, served with crisped potato, olives, and house-made curry. Match it with buttery couscous for an utterly memorable meal.", "yelp_reviews": ["29-August, Wednesday:\nThe dining atmosphere at Aziza is succinctly encapsulated by means of both small touches and broad strokes: low ambient lighting, deep vibrant hues, moorish curved walls, high vaulted ceilings, and arabasque wooden cutouts. This restaurant definitely enchants one and all with its intriguing fusion of Moroccan, Mediterranean, and California fare (*with season, organic, and local ingredients).\n\nFor starters we chose the traditional spread; with houseground chickpeas, yogurt-dill, piquillo-almond and perfetly toasted flatbread pita that was lightly brushed with olive oil. The Basteeya which was a type of phyllo pie was deliciously filled with saffron braised chicken spiced with cinnamon.\n\nThe muddled Tarragon cocktail was subtly medicinal, and resinously hypnotic through the ingenious use of cardamom which in compliment to the Cachaca was intensely aromatic with a smokey long finish. Other cocktails based on tarragon, wild spearmint, and persimmon, were all equally as interesting.\n\nMy chicken roulad with a cepe mushroom gratin was pure bliss on my tongue; comprised mostly of dark thigh meat marbled in its own crisp skin. Served with a side wallop of: crisp celery-bits, savory corn, chewy/nutty wheatberries, and drizzled with a sour berbere sauce.\n\nThis was a fabulous meal, I WILL definitely come back for the tasting menu next time.\nEven given it's out-of-the-way location.", "I have lived in SF for 2 years and always heard good things about Aziza. It was not until I heard the Chef Mourad won over Cat Cora in Iron Chef that I actually made the trip all the way to outer Richmond for it. And my it was worth it.\n\nThe staff was super nice, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. They also made great recommendations for dessert and drinks.\n\nAs for the food itself, its definitely one of the best culinary experiences I have had for a while. We got the Quail, Lamb shank, and Couscous. Everything tasted great. The lamb was so tender and well cooked. The quail had a blend of sweet fruits and crunchy nuts that made it heavenly. The couscous came with Prawns, Chicken, and Lamb with some type of red sauce that was really good too.\n\nFor appetizers, we got lentil soup, spreads (least favorite but still really good), Riblets, and Lamb sausage.\n\nAt the end we got the Spicy Choclate cake and the watermelon for dessert. Both were super interesting and unlike anything I tried before. They were pretty tasty too without being too sweet.\n\nSolid 5 stars. We were 3 people and the damage was about $75 per person for drinks, 4 appetizers, 3 entrees, 2 desserts, and tip.", "This is one of my favorite restaurants in SF. I've been to Morocco several times, and I wouldn't describe it as an authentic Moroccan restaurant, rather a restaurant inspired by Morocco, in the best way.\n\nA few Moroccon-inspired favorites are the duck confit pastille (a take on the common pigeon pastille in morocco), adds sophistication and new complexity to an already excellent combination of sweet and spicey (picture a puff pastry with cinnamon and spices mixed with raisins and poultry), and the couscous, which is actually better than any couscous I've had in Morocco - it just melts in your mouth in a way you never thought couscous could.\n\nCombine these excellent dishes with some more california fare and excellent yet interesting fresh fruit cocktails and it's worth waiting (up to 45 minutes, even with a reservation).  This place is also extremely well-priced for a Michelin starred restaurant (one of the only $$$ ones), and the service is good but no pretentious. Double bonus points for not letting the Michelin man's endorsement ruin such an excellent experience.", "What a wonderful place for a nice dinner!\n\nThe $55 tasting menu offers you the chance to try a soup (lentils or soup of the day) and you pick a starter, main course and dessert from the main menu. In between the starter and the main course, you are served the basteeya, a wonderful salty/sweet concoction of shredded chicken, nuts, wonderful spices, surrounded in phyllo.  I had the clams starter, which was a good sized bowl of clams in a rich buttery sauce with saffron/garlic and a touch of orange peel. It was love at first clam.  The main course was the coucous served with shrimp, lamb, and chicken. The meat was incredibly tender. After all these big portion courses, I went for the watermelon granita and it too was great, especially the strongly flavored rose ice cream. Everything was tasty with rich, strong flavors and a little different , all adding up to a wonderful meal. Not to mention, the serving staff is top-notched and incredibly attentive.\n\nThis place is a winner in my book!", "We were so happy to hear that Aziza is back open and serving our favorite Moroccan food in the city. We sat outside. Most of their heaters outside are broken and with winter approaching in SF, I would recommend getting those fixed! I was cold the entire dinner. Thomas was great, he's a long time server from Mourad, their sister Michelin star restaurant. He was so well spoken and knew the menu like the back of his hand. I appreciated how honest he was about the menu items. As always, the cocktails stole the show. But the little gem salad and the BURRATA!!! I would go back every week just for the burrata. It's quite literally a fancy burrata potato salad. I HIGHLY recommend. See picture below!!!\n\nWe ordered the chicken roulade & lamb shank. The lamb shank didn't steal the show like I thought it would. If you're looking for a full meal that you can get through - go with the roulade!", "DON'T GO HERE.  IT WILL GO TO THEIR HEADS AND THEN THEY WILL START THE SLOW DECENT INTO MEDIOCRITY.\n\nOK, that probably isn't true, as they've been around a long time.  \n\nThis is seriously the best lamb I have ever had, and that means a lot from an Armenian lamb addict.

It all harkens back to times in Italy and adds a modern touch. I also really appreciate the regional pastas that you can't find anywhere else. Sometimes in fact it's like you've been airlifted into a Sardinian agriturismo if it rented space on SL blvd. The service and vision are really forward-thinking with a fine approach to tradition, and I feel like restuarants just keep getting better here. Highly recommend the yellowtail collar.

He didn't disappoint, in fact my husband and I were completely 'taken' by Zach's very innovative dishes, each more delicious than the next. The menu selections were tightly edited yet I could easily have ordered everything on the menu. My favorite was Zach's take on chicken liver croustade which was beyond description. We also shared the grilled Orata which was fresh and perfectly prepared and we are still talking about the delicious almond cake with 'drunken cherries'. The superb food was equal to the superb over-the-top front of the house service. The cool 'vibe' began when Anthony greeted us at the door with a huge smile and very professional demeanor and the GM, Caitlyn was attentive and extremely professional which immediately set the tone for a great experience - cordial, friendly and 'on' their game in the kitchen as well! Nice that Alimento is being touted as a neighborhood restaurant but it won't be long before Alimento becomes known as a destination restaurant well worth a jaunt to Silver Lake from a-far. Congratulations to Zach and Team Alimento!

I work in the restaurant industry so usually I notice every missed step of service or sloppy service point when I go out to eat, but our server was knowledgeable, clear, and professional and our busser was quick to clear away empty dishes.\nThe food was also fantastic. We got three dishes to share: the crispy polenta tartines with whipped baccala and salmon roe, the braised lettuce bruschetta in a parmesan broth, and the radiatori with braised pork, kale, and fennel pollen. I think we were both most impressed by the bruschetta because the idea of cooked lettuce and bread swimming in broth could so easily have veered into a soggy mess, but it was flavorful, crispy in the right places and soft in others. The ambiance was great and overall it didn't end up being as expensive as we expected (probably because we didn't order any wine). Would absolutely recommend.", "Went here before seeing a show at The Ahmanson without a reservation. The hostess was so accommodating and fit us in but let us know that there was a reservation coming so we'd only have roughly 90 minutes. That was perfect for us and we were grateful. The wait staff were all incredibly friendly and we loved the ambiance of the restaurant. We ordered the Radiatori, Dungeness Crab Spaghetti and the Ricotta dumpling in Lamb consomm\u00e9. The only dish we enjoyed was the Ricotta dumpling, it was absolutely divine. The subtle flavors in the broth along with the mushrooms and Ricotta dumpling were a perfect starter for us to share. Our pasta dishes, however, were incredibly salty. I couldn't take more than a few bites of my dish before we just asked for the check. I was wondering if it was mostly because of the parmesan but my mom's spaghetti dish was just as salty. We were very disappointed because we had read so many good reviews and were excited to try it.

I order it every time I go regardless of who I'm with. I wish you could still make an entree out of it with various proteins and veggies. Their shrimp and grits are the best I've had in Cali, while any brunch item with biscuits are going to make you very happy. If you're craving gumbo, jambalaya, beignets, or even a cheeseburger, this is is the spot to get your grub on. I don't drink so you'll have to just trust me when I say they have a noteworthy cocktail program from what I've heard.", "I recently visited the attic after not eating out for a while and it was definitely different. There's a new chef so the menu has been updated and it's honestly kind of lackluster and way more expensive than before. My go to was the chicken pot pie but the substitute is chicken under a brick, which isn't as great imo. The only thing left I really enjoyed that was still available is the Mac and Cheetos, but they use a different type of noodle for it it, it's more stringy. The cheese sauce is still good, but I don't like the new noodle. Maybe I'll be back later once they add more items to the menu, but a lot of the southern food they had available before is long gone.", "On my way to my girl friend's house I hadn't made reservations to anywhere, and it's Friday. I quickly yelped the attic because I knew they take reservations, and I booked one so quickly for 6:45pm.\n\nWe came a bit early and got seated fairly quickly.\n\nAndrew was our server. He was fantastic!\n\nWe got 3 old fashions. Delicious. I had my one with Marker's Mark.\n\nI ordered the gumbo and fried green Tomatoes both so so so good!\n\nMy girl friend ordered 12oz. ribeye. And I have to say very good. We also got fries. Perfectly crispy with a side of aioli.\n\nExceptional Service! I rate this place a 10! Thanks guys! I missed going out and ya'll made it so enjoyable!", "Yummm!!!!\nAnother great lunch at The Attic!\nThe pastrami poutine was GREAT! Hand cut skin on French fries, decent amount of pastrami, white cheddar cheese curds with a yummy brown gravy. Since I consider myself a gravy connoisseur, this one hits the mark. Good flavor, not too thick not too thin.\nPastrami was tasty without too much of a fat cap. Couldn't tell whether the cheese curds \"squeaked\" (a sign of good quality according to my WI cousin) since they were slight warm.  Would DEFINITELY order this again.\nMy lunch date had the bacon cheeseburger. Again with the great hand cut fries. REAL cheddar cheese, nice thick sliced bacon. Another winner.\nCouldn't pass up the beignets. Yes they were light, crisp & warm. Served with a house made jam. Had to ro-sham-bo for the third one though. Make room for these or order your meal accordingly. Just can't pass them up.", "I've been to The Attic twice now and it's always been such a delicious experience for brunch. From the friendly service to the food to the atmosphere (it looks like it was once a house!), everything has been amazing. It's got some nice Southern charm to it, reminding me of brunch places I've had in South Carolina. It's impossible not to splurge when I'm here because I want to eat everything.\n\nOn my most recent visit, we ordered the fried chicken and waffles and the gumbo. I loooved my gumbo so much. I actually miss it. We also did a mimosa flight with different juices (grapefruit, orange, and cranberry). On my first visit, I remember ordering the hot cheetos mac & cheese. Incredible. Not the healthiest, but I think I'm pretty much set to get it again when I'm back in the area.\n\nOnly downside is that there is usually a long wait (my experience from being there on the weekends), so it's best to call ahead and check the wait times. But I think that is probably to be expected for a restaurant of this caliber.", "I came in for breakfast/brunch and was extremely excited to try this amazing Belgian waffle, upon arriving to to the table it looked extremely appetizing with a bit to much powdered sugar but not a big deal.

We finally found our sushi place! But now I feel like we can only ever do omakase coz Eddie set the bar. He started off with the foie gras with truffle wrapped in halibut and topped with osteria caviar... from there we just looked forward to our next bite. When it came to pick between live shrimp and live scallop, my husband chose the latter so I got the shrimp. He said mine was better and he would get that next time. The finale was a melt in your mouth toro. What an overall amazing dinner. It's definitely one of my fave places now!\n\nThe place is small and intimate. I counted 18 seats and Eddie said he doesn't want to accommodate more than that because he wants to be able to give a quality experience.

For those who are from San Gabriel Valley and know Toro Restaurant, this place is comparable if not better.  Personally, I think it's better than Sushi Gen.  My favorite dishes include the following: Live Spiny Lobster Sashimi, Sea Scallop Sushi, Blue Fin Maguro Sushi, Halibut Sushi, Red Snapper Sushi, Yellowtail Toro Sushi, Shima Aji and Bluefin Otoro.  All sushi are served with shiso leave in it and are usually salted or come with ponzu or special sauce on top.  So, there is no need to dip the wasabi soy sauce.  The tempura ice cream is also a must try.  It's definitely worth the drive from downtown LA.", "This is a very good place to go to if you favor the omakase style of sushi.The quality of the fish is top notch. The restaurant is very nice inside and the staff and owner are very good. Why three stars? I felt Sushi Iki is not \"user friendly\" if you don't want sushi prepared just the way the chef/owner thinks you should eat them. I think the chef could listen to his custiomers a bit more instead of hand waving and laughing and telling you to try it the way he is now making it for you. A bit over the top...Also, while non-traditional, I do like to have a california roll or  a spicy tuna roll with my sushi and they don't serve them here. If  omakase is your thing Sushi Iki is a good place.", "I read reviews here on Yelp, knew it was pricy, but was willing to spend good money on premium sushi. My partner and I went on a Friday night (5:30ish) and sat alone in the restaurant for the majority of our meal.\n\nWe sat at the bar, as we always do when we go out for sushi, but as we were being seated the head chef asked who referred us. When I told him we lived within walking distance and that the online reviews further encouraged us to stop in he said, \"Oh, I only asked because we are have premium sushi at premium price and most of our new customers come by referral.\" He then went on to point out different top shelf fish that only his restaurant offered with price per pound. I wasn't sure if he was showing off or trying to intimidate us, but before we even received our first plate I had a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nAs far as the quality of the fish, the yellowtail sashimi was absolutely perfect. The albacore was slightly fishy, but equally as tender as the yellowtail. All portions were enormous and the cut on all fish was the thickest I have ever experienced.\n\nWill I go back? Likely not. I enjoyed each dish, but couldn't get past the elitist atmosphere.", "I found out about this place from the Michelin guide a good year or more ago. Since then I got hooked and have been there many times. Everything is super fresh and has a flavor you may not have experienced yet.\n\nIf you are on a budget and or are looking for rolls this may not be the perfect place for you. While rolls are great there too, you have to go for the nigri/sashimi or specialties to get the best experience. Also while not being cheap, the price is well justified in my perspective. Compared to other great places such as Asanebo, you really get a lot for the money. The presentation is more plain though. Also like the Chef. He is a cool guy and gets me excited about the stuff he sells.\n\nI always get the Super Toro as my last pick and it just as good as it gets. Don't miss it!

This is a gem that I want to dine at least once a month.\n\nExecutive Chef Kunihide Nakajima, former Executive chef of Michelin star Sushi Inoue, is a 3rd generation sushi chef who takes great pride in his work. It was in his blood to carry on the tradition and become a sushi chef. You can tell by talking to him how passionate he is about his work and how he's very particular about where he gets his products, which specific regions of Japan they come from, etc.\n\nIf you dine here, you have to do the Uni tasting, which consisted of generous amounts of uni from Russia and Hokkaido (bafun & the highly prized hadate murasaki uni), and the upgrade cost was very modest, imo.\n\nService - excellent\n\nHighest recommendation\n\n: 10 calendars\n\nNote: There is a bar with a separate bar menu. Hope to try it later.", "Nakaji has a 13 seat omakase counter that is the perfect option for a date night or when you want to impress someone. The restaurant is tucked in an alley deep in Chinatown and the unmarked black door with a very small light box indicating the restaurant named gives off a speakeasy vibe. Chef enthusiastically delivers multiple courses with ceremony and the presentation of some of the courses are akin to art.\n\nA few days ago I had the pleasure of sitting at the bar of Nakaji for a more casual experience of Japanese bar snacks and cocktails. The Japanese whiskey collection is absolutely insane. Definitely try the \"Bowery Smoke\" cocktail; it is literally a smoke show!", "My first true omakase experience was one to forget! Is this what they usually do... pop up behind the counter every 5 minutes, serve one piece and then head back into the kitchen without a word? For all that we could have gone to Nobu? We were told to quiet down and we were abruptly taken back as to how rude this gesture was so we left. There was an extreme lack of care and interest by the sushi chef. You know it's bad when you agree to pay for your entire meal and leave only 4 dishes in.", "A masterful display by Chef Nakajima. Easily one of the most memorable omakase meals I've had anywhere in the world. The stitching of 3 sequential uni plates was unexpected and only added to the boldness of the presentation. Rather than a sake pairing, we opted for a series of Toki highballs (on tap!) which complimented the meal just as well.", "We had been looking forward to Nakaji since it's grand opening.   From the moment we arrived at an inconspicuous door on a side alley (arcade)  to the beautiful and intimate chef's counter, we felt transported into a secret world of luxury and exclusivity.  \n\nEvery detail of this culinary experience is perfectly coordinated.  The individuals on the Nakaji team are definitely \"on point \".  The decor and music flow in sync- the ambiance  is cool, hip and chic.  Each seat of this ten-seat restaurant offers a view into Chef Nakajima's creative journey.  \n\nMouthwatering and extraordinary preparations of sushi included medium fatty tuna, fluke,  grouper, Japanese barracuda, bay scallops, mackerel, snapper, sea perch, sea urchin, fatty tuna cheek and deep sea eel .  \n\nAn incredible gastronomic experience that leaves me knowing that after Nakaji, I am spoiled for life...

Every fish was special and fresh. His speciality is the sea eel. So amazing.\n\nDessert was a Japanese strawberry. Flavor of the fruit was insane how sweet and \"strawberry\" it was!  The fresh mocha leaves me drooling for more.\n\nCome here order the sake. Share with the chef and enjoy a great night of culinary beauty", "In the middle of the down and dirty Chinatown where you hear hawking salespeople every three feet and walk into rubbish every three inches, there's an oasis where only a few are able to get away from it all. Enter through the unassuming door in the dank tunnel and you will be whisked away to a handsome bar where you can enjoy some of the finest whiskeys and cocktails known to any body. I never really liked Old Fashions because they're usually overbearing in flavors but this place, this bartender, this fine glass of OF is absolutely divine.\n\nFood wise, we ordered whatever we could at the bar, including the uni tasting menu. We both loved everything. From the sea cucumber to the pumpkin to the tuna, all was scrumptious. Who knew you can get gorgeous uni from Russia?? My mind was blown for sure. Just when we thought we couldn't get any more delicious food, the staff informed us we can get sushi and sashimi of the day from the kitchen. We couldn't pass it up, naturally. We devoured it all but savored every bite. I cannot wait to return to try the omakase, which I can only imagine to be divine.", "Nakaji was a great way to end our NYC trip!

Also, the entire staff from Chef Kunihide Nakajima to the servers and Sabrina were extremely welcoming and kind.\n\nIt was awesome watching Chef alone prepare and serve all the sushi. It really is an art and Chef makes it an entertaining experience for visitors. Highly recommend getting the uni tasting.

For dessert we ordered the roasted pear which we enjoyed very much. Overall, it was a satisfying light dinner.\n\nThe deep red leather-like banquettes were not very comfortable for me. Avoid the inside corner table under the mezzanine area (slatted wood ceiling), there's a cold breeze (air conditioner?) blowing from under the corner seat (ankle level), if given that seat just ask them to give you another table.

Although quite good as is, it might have been better with another element like sweetbreads.\n\nTheir signature dish, the tajarin pasta, didn't impress. The ramen-like tajarin noodles were too thin to hold the diced \"salsiccia di bra\" sausages and didn't want to absorb the sauce. Although full of rich ingredients like a pork sugo, the sauce wasn't luscious, but watery.\n\nThe \"coujette\" entr\u00e9e had large and spongy gnocchi in a sauce of duck, cream, and onion. The menu said \"foie gras butter\" was in the dish, but there was no hint of foie - particularly when the sauce was thin and not rich.\n\nThe atmosphere was not as high-end as I expected with plenty of diners in jeans and sweatjackets.

Is it really that serious? Well, it's not every day you run into a ramen shop with the coveted Michelin reputation.\n\nAt this point, what is there to say about Ramen that hasn't been said? Mensho is really as good as it gets. Not the typical miso based ramen that I've come to love, but just as satisfying. The tori paitan is a rich creamy chicken soup, with both pork and duck! The noodles are thick and chewy, perfection that can only be achieved by hand made noodles. This bowl is the kind of thing that warms your soul. Kind of like what chicken noodle soup claims to do, if chicken noodle soup was actually good (it's time we stop pretending!)\n\nMensho is easily the most worth it line I've ever made. Yes, you will also be made to wait, at all hours of operation. If you visit San Francisco and don't spend any time in a line wrapped around a building waiting for food, does your visit really count?", "Today's one of the hottest days in the city. And what does my dad want for dinner? Ramen.\n\nAnd it was a good call!\n\nI can see why the lines are long for this place. The ramen is very good! I had the Tori Paitan Ramen. And I was amazed at the first spoonful! It was creamy and earthy, and rich with the duck chashu.  And the pork was silky.  I don't even like kale, but the kale in the ramen was pretty good.\n\nWe came just in the before the dinner rush, but since the place is small, the wait time can be awhile, especially for a larger group. It's advised that you look at the menu ahead of time so you can order right away. We waited about 15mins, which is standard. And we got our ramen quickly since we ordered right away.\n\nSince it was really hot outside, it was also hot inside. But eating the ramen basically matched my body temperature to the hot weather. I was sweating, yes, but it was bearable.\n\nI would love to come back here again and try their clear broth ramen.", "Super limited seating- I think it's three long tables, with a capacity of about 26-28 people at a time? This may be from mental memory, but the wait was worth it.\n\nI remember seeing \"No take out or to-go boxes\", which means: you better bring an appetite, or be okay with leaving leftovers there. Unless you have stomach capacity the size of their seating space, I'm sure you'll be able to enjoy and devour the ramen like my partner and I did.\n\nWe went with the Tori Paitan- regular for me, spicy for him. Both taste similar and are very creamy, but the spicy gets a little bit different (not just the spice, but maybe another ingredient?). Loved the noodle size- somewhat chunky, rich soup, two kinds of chashu (pork and duck), some kale, bamboo shoots, and katsuobushi sauce (dried, fermented skipjack tuna). The spicy doesn't have the sauce, and has nuts, jalapeno miso, and cabbage instead.\n\nVery efficient seating and service, it really is all dependent on how quickly (or slowly) you eat! I'd return, but probably at a less busy time... who knows?", "I heard this place is one of the best ramen joints in SF. Came here on a on a Friday night and the line was up to the blue/white sign, which means the wait is at least 45/60mins long. We waited about 45 mins for two which was alright, but the worst thing is you have to stay in line cause you can't leave your name and walk around.\n\nI ordered the spicy Lamb ramen with the extra duck and my bf got the Shio ramen. We both added the egg to our ramen (highly REC)! I did not enjoy the lamb ramen, the broth was really thick and it tasted like the lamb skewers at the Chinese night market. However I did like the duck chasu which was really tender. I actually liked the shio ramen more it was lighter and soup was really good. The chasu was also flavourful and tender !\n\nWould probably come back for the shio ramen but maybe during a time where the wait is shorter !", "If you're on the fence, I think it's worth it trying out Mensho Tokyo SF at least once. I've tried the Vegan Tantanmen, Spicy Lamb Ramen, A5 Wagyu Shoyu Ramen and Chashu Mazesoba. Out of all of them, my favorite is definitely the Spicy Lamb Ramen, there's a lot going on: the broth is really creamy and flavor-packed, with cumin driving the rest of the spices. It also offers a variety in texture with the eggplants, ground lamb, thick noodles, and spiced fried chips on top. Really delicious, especially on a chilly evening!\n\nTheir noodles are thick and requires some chew which I know many people enjoy, and definitely make sense with the richness of most of their broths (though personally I'm more partial to softer noodles); they hold onto the broth very well. I also really enjoy their smoked duck add-on, so simple but oh so yummy! A great little treat and addition to any bowl. :)\n\nThere will almost always be a wait so I advise planning your dinner trip accordingly and, since their shop is small, to be mindful of others waiting in line if you plan to dine-in and socialize for an extended period of time with a large party. Overall, a very solid choice for delicious ramen with very well-cared for ingredients.", "All I can say is, everything positive you've heard is the truth. Just get here early because the wait is the most and only annoying thing about this place. The ramen is like getting a hug of deliciousness. I tried the spicy lamb, it was delightfully spiced but nothing over powering. The broth was so flavorful I had to slurp it until the last drop."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/mensho-tokyo-sf-san-francisco?hrid=yFhh6thDFMbdCYoSDhTd0Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mensho-tokyo-sf-san-francisco?hrid=kd_WYtpCnY6NgG_sqUsR_g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mensho-tokyo-sf-san-francisco?hrid=VVoDlbrJT8WYbaQGDSX1bA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mensho-tokyo-sf-san-francisco?hrid=UrtoSGEbafk00qW1FP6fbg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mensho-tokyo-sf-san-francisco?hrid=kdSvaT9WJbMNaIhBckGW9A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mensho-tokyo-sf-san-francisco?hrid=W9lZmXxXAdof9JzNioBpYQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Kiriko", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/kiriko-los-angeles/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/kiriko", "michelin_pov": "One bite of a glistening piece of sashimi at this Westside gem and it will come as no surprise that Chef/owner Ken Namba was raised in the environs of Japan's famous Tsukiji fish market.

The chef will ask you around the $100-ish mark whether you wish to continue. This evening, we ordered two large Asahi, and the omakase. We had around 11-12 pairings, which came out to about 23 excellent pieces of sushi per person. The range was everything from toro (fatty tuna) to two kinds of uni (both imported and local). We really loved our chef's pairings, because his concept was to present to complimentary fish together.

I recommend asking the head chef to do a nigiri-focused omakase, where you'll get to sample an assortment of supremely fresh fish, a variety of tastes/textures (they'll add in things such as mango and salmon), and very good sushi rice.  Kiriko veers toward the new style of sushi with some non-traditional tastes, yet the basis is still excellent fish over rice.\n\nThis is a bit of local gem, and there are a lot of devoted customers.  Omakase experiences improve over time, especially with the head chef, as he begins to understand your tastes and preferences.", "I went to Japan a while back and when I feel like returning, Kiriko is where I go to!

But enough about the decor since we do also go to restaurants for the food...\n\nThey have a wide array of sushi. You will not be disappointed with the variety. If you are into more exotic Japanese dishes, you can also find monkfish liver prepared to perfection. If you love the sushi you've had in the past but also want to branch out, I recommend the \"omakase\", which is the suggestion of the chef. This is how I discovered yummy eel and I keep coming back! The hamachi sashimi is divine as is the red snapper sushi.

It was deep fried, but when you cut into it, the yolk still oozed out like a perfectly poached egg. That was followed by the shiitake mushroom soup, which was so airy and tasty, it felt like i was eating a mushroom-flavored cloud. For the main course we ate pan roasted striped bass, which was cooked to perfection. We then finished off with the lucky pig, which was succulent, and fall of the bone juicy.

Our dry pot contained 8 ingredients - eye of round, pig intestine, beef tongue, sliced lamb, fish cake, bok choy, broccoli, and tofu skin. It was a wonderful balance of meat and veggie, and I loved all the different textures that each ingredient brought to the dish.

Apparently to prove that there was chicken, we were asked in front of friends to pull out a piece so they could \"examine\" it. Lo and behold, it was chicken.  They didn't even have the decency originally to compensate us in any way (they gave us some red bean dish that we didn't care for or ask for).  We called for the restaurant manager who then said she couldn't do anything about it, unless she called her \"boss\".  The way they handled the whole situation was so humiliating to us. When we've been in this situation before (where you specify and allergy or dietary preference) and the kitchen accidentally puts something in it you ask for it not to, the dish at the very least is comped or the meal without question.

It comes with rice on the side for no additional charge. The ingredients list is separated by type of meat, poultry, seafood, vegetable, or other. They have a LOT of ingredients to choose from, everything from chicken gizzard to cheese filled fish cake and taro. I recommend getting regular spicy, its a good level of heat and if it isn't spicy enough for you you can always add more chili oil.\n\nGreat place for trying new things and sharing with friends!

So these 5 stars I give might be kind of biased.\n\nBut ANYWAYS this place is the BOMB...I get cravings for it all the time. The ma la flavoring they use reminds me of the seasoning they put on Chinese skewers but obviously more numbingly spicy. The concept is pretty ubiquitous in China and similar to hot pot, you pick your proteins, veggies, misc. add-ons like tofu or rice cakes, spice level ranging from non-mild to super spicy, and rice (purple or white....but who does white?). They then stir fry, mix it, and serve it for you in this big wooden bowl. My favorites are the sliced eye of round, quail egg, roe filled fish ball, wood ear mushroom, baby corn, and glass noodles. Only thing I'm not a fan of here is the cheese filled fish cake-sounds good in theory, meh on execution. But honestly there are so many options it's just a matter of what you like.

This is definitely the most authentic and delicious DRY POT in town. The presentation of food may not have the traditional look of deliciousness, but once the food is in your mouth, the flavor and spice would just thrive on your tongue. The flavor of the combination of ingredients is well amplified by a variety of spice. They have many unique but authentic Chinese ingredients that you wouldn't normally find in other Szechuan restaurants. The fried young chicken is also another signature of this place.

I called ahead to make sure that they could accommodate since we were a large party (10+) and the staff was very friendly and hospitable.\n\nOur reservation was around 8:30 PM on a weekday evening so the restaurant was on the quiet side, but spacious for us - with the addition of a few other small parties in the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the cheeseboard to share and it was beautifully plated. Cheeseboard dreams are made like this. The menu states that all pastas are made in-house, so I was very excited to try the Tagliatelle which also includes the restaurant's namesake ingredient, Cardoncello mushrooms, and I'm happy to report that it did not disappoint. Cooked perfectly to al dente (expected of any Italian restaurant), the Tagliatelle was flavorful and tantalizing to all senses. I tried a bite of the Paccheri and sides as well and those also were also done well.\n\nOverall, a very solid experience and impressed with service and quality. I don't crave Italian food very often but I would come back again and highly recommend anyone looking to give this place a try!", "Amazing food and great service! We booked this restaurant for 6 people on Friday night and were seated by the open kitchen on a round table. This place gives a very cozy and family feeling. They have many specials that night including asparagus souffl\u00e9 with truffle for appetizer,and lobster ravioli. We ordered a lot of dishes to share. I definitely recommend going with a lot of people so you can try different things. We ordered tuna tartare, asparagus souffl\u00e9, and tomino which is cheese wrapped in prosciutto. My favorite was the asparagus souffl\u00e9 omg this dish doesn't taste like vegetable at all!!! It's like a layered pie. Then for the second dish we had the Taglierlini with clams, and their special risotto with black truffle. The risotto was a little salty but still delicious. For the main course, we had the grilled monkfish, the branzino, grilled small chicken, wagyu beef cheek, and shrimp with squid ink rice. I think my favorite was the chicken dish. Then we had all of the desserts on the menu!! Haha the bill came out to be 160 per persons with 3 bottles of wine and one cocktail each. Amazing amazing place! We will definitely revisit :)", "Traveled to nyc for business and had a pretty terrible travel day so wanted a glass of wine and something comforting... and got everything I needed at Cardoncello DiVino.\n\nI ate at the bar so didn't see the dining area but from what I could see the whole place had a very comfortable vibe. From what I can tell on here this place only opened recently but sitting at the bar you would think it was an established spot with long time regulars- the staff was so friendly with all the customers, just a very warm, friendly atmosphere.\n\nAnd then the food. I got three courses which was probably 1.5 too many but it was sooooo good I couldn't help myself. I started with the beet salad. Simple, fresh ingredients that all paired well together. Got the Cavatelli based on the bartenders recommendation and was not disappointed. Then finished up with the Catalana which was amazing- not too sweet. And the only course I was able to pause and take a picture of before diving into.\n\nOverall a great meal and makes me wish I was coming back more to nyc so I could try more off the menu!", "Like the name says, Cardoncello Di Vino is truly divine! Cozy atmosphere, all waiters and waitresses have been kind, fast and very professional...and of course the food was top notch. Caserecce pasta, galletto and millefoglie as dessert, everything was more than divine!\nIf you are up for some real Italian food, this is one of the best place to stop by in the City.", "This was a dining experience from the moment we were seated until we left. The wait staff were attentive, and did an excellent job of describing specials and regular items on menu. The restaurant offers an EVOO course which I am so happy that we tried. There are 4 varieties to sample that come with a food pairing, the oil is available for purchase if you would like to take a bottle home. The autumn salad and chick pea soup were both great starts. I had the haddock, perfectly cooked served with Brussels sprouts, fingerling potatoes and heirloom carrots - perfection. My family chose pasta, they devoured their entrees! They did save room for tiramisu which was among some of the best that we have tried. They do have an extensive wine list and some interesting speciality cocktails. We will return!\nForgot to mention the cardoncello mushroom side - first time any of us had eaten this varietal- highly recommend that you give it a taste, really spectacular flavor.", "Was looking for a place to eat as the PATH was down today. Cardoncello DiVino was 0.2 miles away from the station so I grabbed a seat at the bar. Good vibes, good music, friendly service. I was waited on by the bartender - Elvis was his name. Very kind. Helped me choose a wine. He didn't try to up-sell me, but simply found something I liked! Prior to dinner I received a basket of bread and and olive oil mixed with basil and perhaps some other Italian seasonings. I ordered the fettuccine as my entree. Not your regular fettuccine though, it had mushrooms and a cream sauce. Delicious.\n\nI would absolutely go back. It's a little tight (like most places in NYC), so maybe a dinner for 2. Sit at the bar, meet Elvis!", "Every part of our experience was perfection-- the food, the wine list, the staff, the decor... even the restroom was wonderful.\n\n(If you're looking for Alfredo, chicken parm, etc., this isn't the place for you.)

Dinner however brings more ambitious dishes, including a Berkshire pork chop, which when accompanied by a dandelion-salsa verde, forms the very essence of fresh and vibrant flavors.", "yelp_reviews": ["I'm thrilled to have moved down the street from Outerlands! This place is awesome. I came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning, though I kept thinking how much I want to come back and sit at the bar for a few drinks. I came here with three other people, and we arrived right when Outerlands opened. There was already a huge wait, but their sign-up system is very organized. Just write your name on the list and hang out. Fortunately it was a nice day to stand outside.\n\nWe were finally seated at a communal table by our friendly waitress. We ordered a few menu items to share, including the donut, potatoes, and quiche. The portions were small but just the right amount of food for us and a good mix of sweet and savory. The quiche was light and fluffy. The potatoes with aioli were my favorite, which is obvious if you know how much I love potatoes. And the donut with glazed apricots was delicious.\n\nOverall great experience and excuse to explore Outer Sunset and take a walk down to Ocean Beach afterwards!", "To my surprise I haven't reviewed Outerlands yet. I've probably been here 15 times over the last 4 years and I was back again today for lunch. I've mostly been for weekday lunch and weekend brunch, though I have also been once for dinner.\n\nThe wait is pretty long on most weekends for brunch, but during the week there is usually no wait at all. The atmosphere here has a cozy feel with all the wood but also feels quite modern. I usually sit at the bar on the weekdays and order either a Fieldwork IPA or a cappuccino. The bartenders are attentive and provide good service, and the wait staff has always done a good job as well.\n\nMy favorite thing to order at weekend brunch is probably the many seasonal variations of Eggs in Jail. For weekday lunch it's hard to beat the breakfast tostada with pulled pork. If it's summer time, look for the delicious heirloom tomato soup and pair it with the grilled cheese - a winning combination. For dinner I thought the burger was quite good.\n\nI've never really had a bad meal here and the food is usually pretty interesting takes on some pretty standard dishes. I think we're perhaps a little past the hype phase that this restaurant once had, but it still delivers every time.", "Always yummy but man is the wait for this place intense. Luckily there's a cute parklet to drink bloody Mary's or coffee while you wait.\n\nI loved the Bloody Mary but my friend did not. It's spicy & comes garnished with pickled string beans which I love. Coffee was yummy & they refill for free, which is nice.\n\nThe best dish was definitely the Huevos Rancheros! It was special and could easily be made Vegas by skipping the egg on top.\n\nThe market greens were really phenomenal and seem like an under-ordered hero. We had it without cheese and the salad dressing was just delicious. I would eat it on anything.\n\nThe potatoes were just a little too big and not crispy enough, but man that aioli! However, the rosemary is what makes them special. They are second in the city only to Plow so very worthwhile to split.\n\nThe quince paste on the sticky was not great, but very seasonal. It's a nice object to share though.\n\nGotta mention the Heath ceramics. Pretty and very local. Cute atmosphere inside too with all the reclaimed wood & some really sexy flower arrangements (pinecones gave it a hella nice touch).\n\nThe service is not great. I didn't get that attentive & nice homey vibe. It's more dismissive hipster.", "I'm going to make a big statement here: Outerlands may have the best bread I've ever tasted. Springy, yeasty, soft, crunchy, it's well worth the carbs. We had a plate to start, immediate ordered a second one, and then ordered some bread to take home.\n\nWhile for me the bread was the most memorable part of the meal, the rest was all very tasty too though a bit pricey for the size of the plates.\n\nWe also ordered the smoked salmon toast and Berkshire pork chop. The toast wasn't anything that exciting, though the pork chop was really juicy and flavourful, drizzled with this beautiful herb oil and charred peppers. We topped it all off with the coconut panna cotta which was just divine. Love the flavor combos of rich cream, understated turmeric and ripe persimmons.\n\nGreat locals spot, sophisticated and ever-changing menu with seasonal produce done simply to show off the natural flavors.", "A couple years ago, a gf and I had a weekly brunch date. Since we both live in the Avenues, we had our eye on Outerlands for some time. But most weekends, we'd sleep in and go to a later brunch, so we were always starving when we headed out. The wait at Outerlands seemed like torture when all we wanted was food right away! Finally, in February of 2012, we woke up a little earlier and made our way to Outerlands. The wait ended up being about an hour, so we were ready to eat!\n\n*dutch pancake - baked in a cast iron pan: sweet - topped with spiced apples\n*house-made chili-sage breakfast sausage\n*fried egg open-faced sandwich: maple smoked ham, anaheim peppers, gruyere, aioli\n*eggs in jail: bacon, toast, side of greens\n\nSo all the food was good. But was it amazing? Was it worth an hour wait and all the months of waiting before I finally made it here? Eh, maybe, maybe not. I don't think Outerlands lived up to the hype. If we had no wait (or very little wait), I'd probably give them 4 stars, but minus one for building up my expectations and not quite meeting them.", "I had a really great lunch today at Outerlands.\nWeather was so nice near Ocean Beach had to stop in for some healthy food. Really awesome flavors in the\nVeggie Hash;\nPotato, cabbage, onion, roasted mushroom, goat cheese, folded eggs.\n\nI also shared with my friend the\nGranola & Goat Yogurt;\nMulberries, seeds, nuts, oats, fresh orange slices.\nThe house coffee was also very good.\nI want to try the trout frittata next time.\nI saw a few people enjoying it, loved how it looked, yUm!\n\nOverall great lunch spot.

Same with the linguine -- it had Uni in it with clams and was pretty spicy but so worth it.

We made a reservation and even though they told us they were \"squeezing us in\" at 7pm, when we arrived there were many open tables and the communal table was only half full.

The mushrooms had a strong herbal flavor in my opinion. The sauce on the side, complemented well. I believe it was corn based? Both noodle soups were very flavorful! The soup base did not disappoint in flavor at all the. The young chicken egg (quite a few) reminded me of a soft boiled egg.. but with just the yolk.. very interesting. The tomato lemongrass was also very flavorful, I'm not the biggest fan of tofu, but the soup gave the tofu such an amazing flavor!

I've been to Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. Food is cheap, fresh, local, cheap, spicy; complex, and cheap! D.C. is getting pretty good at translating 'exotic' cuisine into something approachable and affordable yet still authentic. Doi Moi gets it right. You'll never find the same local plants, and even some of the same local spices here in North America, but with fried Crispy Morning Glory, spring rolls with dark greens and carrots you wrap around the roll, and vermicelli noodles, they hit all the right notes of Vietnam! We also enjoyed the pork belly skewers and the simple yet choke full of crab, crab-fried rice! Honestly, the most expensive part of our bill was the $10 cocktails; but with flavors like Basil Lemongrass and Passion Fruit, it's hard not to say yes to a second glass! Hip and clean atmosphere centered around a square bar, this place is worth making a reservation or showing up early to crab a table. And while taking a trip out to 7 Corners might get you closer to authentic Vietnamese, the aesthetics, service, and stumbling proximity to the metro, will keep me coming back to Doi Moi!!", "Great addition to 14th Street and the DC restaurant scene in general.  Think of this as kind of like Little Serow without the line, with an ala carte menu  and with nicer decor.  The welcome is warm, the room very attractive and the service friendly and professional.  There's a full bar and some specialty cocktails.  The one made with tamarind and peanut infused bourbon is a nice way to start dinner.  The wine list is well chosen, matched nicely to the food and fairly priced.  The cooking is excellent, with great flavors and textures, authentic spices and lots of choices. The ground duck and duck liver salad is one of the best things I've eaten all year!.  Sable fish, halibut, Issaan sour sausage and several other authentic dishes disppeared quickly. The only disappointment was the spring rolls, which were nothing special (Tom Sietsema was right). While the cooking is spot on,  Little Serow is still the best Thai resturant in DC. However, Doi Moi is an excellent alternative and provides a bit more flexibility and choice, not to mention reservations (if you're willing to be seated at 5:00, 5:30 or 6:00 PM).  I'll most definitely be back.", "I went to Doi Moi with my husband, two-year-old, and five-month-old for 5pm dinner on a Wednesday night. I doubt we're their typical clientele, but everyone was really nice and accommodating. (It probably helped that we were the only people in the restaurant at the time.) The decor at Doi Moi is really nice - bright and modern with beautiful tiled walls, floor to ceiling windows, and a big open kitchen. It's a sharing style menu, so we ordered a bunch of starters: coconut chicken skewers, pork steamed buns, kee mao stir fried rice noodles, and papaya salad (with spicy chili lime dressing), and one main dish: Vietnamese caramelized pork ribs. We also ordered sticky rice, which may have been my son's favorite item (he also liked the chicken skewers and the noodles). Literally every dish was awesome - there wasn't anything that fell flat. The presentation on the ribs was especially nice.", "Swung in for a bite during a rainy Sunday. Sat outside which was quite lovely with the rain due to the roof built over the el fresco dining area. Ordered the crispy Brussels, the fried beef jerky, and the braised ribblet. I have a healthy appetite but that proved to be plenty for me even though I was sharing most of it. The Brussels sprouts were decent, though not particularly special. The ribblets were sweet and sour and quite tasty but a little hard. The fried beef jerky didn't taste like beef jerky--but it was addictive. It had a tangy kick that wasn't overpowering but was enjoyable. I will definitely return and make sure to order the fried beef jerky again.", "I really liked this place. The interior of the restaurant is actually very large, and it features outdoor seating, which gives patrons plenty of options. It's more of a cafe-type vibe where you order at the counter and. they bring your food. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, and it was. really good. It was served on a French baguette-type roll and was very similar to a B\u00e1nh m\u00ec -- shredded carrots, peppers, and some sort of sauce, like an aioli. I appreciated that the sandwich was hot and tasted very fresh, I didn't feel like the chicken had been sitting under a heat lamp for quite some time. It appeared to be mixed white and dark meat, so I wouldn't order it expecting a Chick-fil-a type breast patty, but it was still very good! I also had a cold brew coffee. The \"large\" truly deserves to be called a large in air quotes. It was about 12 ounces by my guess, which is a tall/small at Starbucks. It was quality cold brew, however. Sandwich and coffee was $22 before tip. All things considered that's a bit pricy. For $17 more, you can get bottomless brunch just about anywhere. Despite this, I will certainly be back to try other menu items!", "Although I continue to be impressed by space--especially the newly-upgraded bar, allowing it to serve customers on the (new) patio as well as those indoors--I was underwhelmed by the food on my latest visit, when I tried the spring rolls and pork chop platter.  The rolls were crispy but more bland than those at Four Sisters, but the accompanying dipping sauce tasted mostly of lime, and lacked the umami funk of fish sauce.  Nuoc cham from any Vietnamese restaurant is far tastier.  Our pork chop platter was gorgeous and had the same lame sauce, though the meat was a little dry.

Portions are generous.\n\nFavorites:\n\nWhole Sizzling Catfish w/ Ginger Topped w/ Ponzu Sauce\nShanghi Lobster w/ Spicy Ginger Sauce And Crispy Spinach\nChinois Chicken Salad\nCantonese Duck with Fresh Plum Sauce\nVegetarian Fried Rice\nSzechuan Beef\nLobster Rolls\nCreme Brulee Trio\n\nP.S. Order some of their delectable specials...  you can't go wrong.", "The restaurant is small and tables are so close to one another. The waiters and other diners kept hitting my chair when they walked by. It was pretty annoying. We got the bloomspot 3 course prix fixe dinner for $110.\n\nFor appetizers, we had Chinois Chicken Salad and Calamari & Rock Shrimp Salad. The Chinese mustard vinaigrette on the chicken salad was almost nonexistent. It was too plain. The batter on the Calamari & Rock shrimp was thick and gooey. Not good whatsoever.\n\nFor entree, I had grilled salmon and hubby had Charcoal Grilled Szhechuan beef. Salmon was a little dry and noodles were bland. Beef was nothing unique.\n\nWe added the Shanghai Lobster since its their signature dish. The curry sauce on the rice was rich. Fried spinach was fatty goodness. Overall a good dish but I don't think it was worth $55.\n\nFor dessert, we had Caramelized Mango Passionfruit Cheesecake and Warm Chocolate Fondant. Cheesecake was caramelized like Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Passionfruit made it really refreshing and absolutely delicious. Flourless chocolate cake was surprisingly not dense or overly sweet.\n\nOur meal was not worth $200+. Food had no wow factor and being there about 2 hours made me claustrophobic due lack of space.", "I suppose this is one of fusion restaurants produced in the early age (3 star, 12/9/2019). The sophistication of taste seems to fall behind comparing to other popular ones such as Cassia and Lukshon. We ordered chicken salad, Moo Shu Shell, Steamed Sea Bass, and crispy spinach along with some liquor. The chicken salad reminded me of one from Trader Joe's, which is not a bad thing, but certainly not mind-blowing. Moo Shu Shell was juicy and rich. Steamed Sea Bass was slightly over cooked with thick brown sauce, not my favorite as I prefer the Cantonese style. However, they can accommodate a half portion instead of whole is that is sufficient for a group of a few. Crispy spinach was interesting and tasty, though I'd order some other veggies if you want to have \"veggies\" given this one makes you eat more fat/oil than spinach! Service is good, though they tend to like clearing your plate as soon as it becomes empty even if the rest of the group is still enjoying dishes.", "The decor and ambiance is very outdated - lots of pastel blue and stereotypical asian things.\n\nBUT - the food is excellent.  the duck pancake appetizer was to die for - the hoisin based sauce is worth licking the plate :)  the sizzling calamari and rock shrimp salad had very lightly coated fresh calamari and rock shrimp in a wonton bowl on a very generous portion of asian salad dressed lightly and perfectly.  we ordered the mushrooms and stir fried veggies as sides and they were both wonderfully seasoned although i was definitely partial to the mushrooms.  we had the setzuan beef, lamb chops, and cod.  all 3 had distinct flavors and great texture.  the lamb had a wonderful cilantro based sauce.  the cod had crispy skin and soft melt in your mouth meat.  we finished with a macademia tart and some kind of meringue.  loved both but the macademia tart was a bit too heavy for me.  the meringue was nice and light and the fresh berries ended my meal very well.  overall a great experience and the price was not as bad as Spago.  The only reason I took a star off was for the ambiance/decor although i'm sure there's historical value to keeping the original look.", "We went on the night of the MLK holiday and I have to tell you how nice the whole staff-especially the manager were to myself and my husband.\n\nNot being familiar with the area, we kept driving past the restaurant because my husband got the street number wrong.

From clay oven-baked breads and house-made charcuterie to an extensive raw bar, the kitchen presents bold offerings. Popular Vietnamese-inspired plates feature pork with vermicelli noodles alongside colonial mash-ups like chopped escargots with lemongrass butter.

Interesting menu and probably can't go wrong with any of it. Clay oven bread with white bean pur\u00e9e is good (but with 6 pieces it's a large portion for just two if you're getting lots of other things!). The spicy wontons were delicious and the cod/shrimp blend was a nice twist to them. For those not very spicy tolerant, can ask for Chile oil on the side and add as you wish. I liked that you can do this for most of the dishes to spice to your liking; just ask your server. It helped keep some of that strong flavor in the dish without overpowering. The beef rendang is incredible, rich curry with a nice sized and really tender beef. The kon loh mee was also delicious and good flavors with perfect pork belly char siu. For dessert (pro tip), ask for the kaya toast (under appetizers). It's a really unique sweet dish, so despite the egg it makes a great dessert. The coconut and butter flavors were delicious--had to order another!", "I had heard a lot about Cassia but what made me finally make a reservation was when I happened to walk by the restaurant itself one night and saw how beautiful it looked and how excellent the menu seemed.\nI decided to make a special event of my first time there by inviting my girlfriend to go with me when she returned from London, as a welcome back celebration.\nWe were not disappointed. First of all someone at Cassia who plans the seating arrangement put us in an amazing corner where we could sit side by side. Completely reading my mind :)\nThe wait staff are friendly and knowledgable.\nThe menu was explained to us and we were asked if we had food sensitivities. Drinks were ordered, the wine list is impressive and so is their non alcoholic list.\nThe service is swift but never rushed.\nWhen it came time to order the food, we did take our waiters advice and we were not disappointed.\nWe started with the plum salad, then the Beef Rendang and finally the black Cod.\nSuch a great combination of favors here. Truly an art. The food is exquisitely presented, a good range of colors and textures.\nWe were truly in bliss that night!\nAlso the desert menu was just outstanding.\nEvery part of this meal was superb!\nThank you Cassia! See you again soon.", "Wow...talk about impressed!  After traveling through SE Asia, I can honestly say I really enjoyed all the flavors.  We ordered the clay oven bread to start--the Koda Farms with chick-pea, curry and coconut milk.  It was our favorite dish of the evening.  Order it--you won't be disappointed.\n\nNext up were the pea tendrils which were crunchy and seasoned perfectly.  As I LOVE kaffir lime leaves, I had to order the beef rendang.  It came to our table in a clay pot and reminded us of some street vendor food we had in Kaula Lumpur.  Served over jasmine rice and overflowing with an addictive curry sauce, we were quite content with this final course.\n\nThere simple isn't enough outdoor dining options in the South Bay, so if you can--get a table on the patio.  It made for a lovely date night under the stars.", "So excited to have the chef behind Spice Table here on the westside!  The loft like space in a Deco building was very cool but the food was the superstar.  Every dish showed so much creativity and thoughtfulness.\n\nWe order the Vietnamese pate to start the flat bread was toasty and had perfect crunch next to the pate.  The spread was spiced in a very unusual Asian way that I know I will be craving tomorrow.  \n\nNext we had a perfect fresh and spicy green papaya salad followed by an egg custard.  The custard was really soft, creamy and dressed with two beautiful pieces of uni and a savory sauce.  My husband goes crazy for any dish with uni and this was lovely.\n\nThe plates are plenty to share and we were getting full so we went for the Black Cod.  It was served with greens in a broth.  Home run again!\n\nGreat huge menu with lots to try - next time we plan and trying some of the dishes we saw coming off the grill and out of the raw bar.", "I'll keep this brief. This place is the restaurant I would visit whenever I'm in Santa Monica! Oh, it's run by the same people who also ran Rustic Canyon with partners from another well known establishment in the old Little Tokyo.\n\nEnough of the semantics, this is considered an upscale Southeast Asian fare designed to catered to the fine dining crowd of Santa Monica. Buzzy, trendy, chic, upscale.. yada yada, those are the words you'll hear if you are looking for good place to dine on special occasions or a cool night out with your close cliques.\n\nYes, they have Singaporean dishes that may not be well known, but trust me it can played well with the fine dining crowd who are not looking to eat a mess. These are too good to be a messy buffet you usually seen from your Chinatown restaurants. This is a very exquisite dishes that played out well with the date night crowd or girls night out kind of atmosphere. A must visit if you are in town for a dynamic night out on the town in the westside.", "Delicious & a great addition to Santa Monica. When you have a team like Cassia, we know it'll do well. We had the organic egg custard with sea urchin, jellyfish salad, whole grilled sea bass, flattened half chicken, laksa, charcuterie fried rice, chopped escargot, and sampled 5 of the desserts. I HIGHLY recommend the decadent chopped escargot. It was rich, buttery, and delicious. All of the offerings we tasted tonight were high quality and yummy.\n\nWe shared all the dishes family style and it was a perfect portion for the five of us.\n\nThere's ample street parking ($2 p/h) and they have valet ($8) on the side.\n\nPresentation was spot on. Staff was attentive and friendly. Decor was open & had a very relaxing environment. Intimate for dates and great for celebrations.

If that doesn't say it was great, I don't know what does. It was a freezing cold Friday morning when I arrived with two friends to the restaurant with no reservation, which was no problem at all. I've heard it's crazier on the weekend though. We were seated at a beautiful white marble table next to big windows and shining light and a tiny old school wood burning furnace. This place is COZY AS HELL. Everything here is cute. The coffee cups and milk jars, the hot sauce bottles, the music, literally everything. Beyond aesthetics the food is incredible. We ordered the egg & sausage sandwich with avocado, the cheddar scrambled egg plate, and the infamous pancakes to share (because how could we not.) Everything was simple, but phenomenal. The pancakes lived up the the hype and tasted like Christmas morning. Definitely something to share though because they're very rich. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the bacon was CRIPSY CRIPSY CRISPY. Our cute waiter kept the coffee refills flowing and the tunes bumping. We sat there for two and a half hours.

Whether you are spending time on their roof deck, or any of the rooms among the three floors.. It's just such a comfortable and elegant space..\n\nI have had most of their two seasonal menus so far and I can say, all the food has been delicious.. From their homemade Sourdough Bread, to their in house smoked black cod, the roasted mushrooms, the whole roasted fish, everything has been memorable. They have a beautiful wood fired oven that they really know how to us.  Their constantly changing specials menu is really something to pay attention to.. Last time, we had a half roasted pigs head that was some of the best pork I have ever had..\n\nI wish this restaurant all the success and accolades they deserve..

It's truly special and unique..", "I stumbled upon Sunday in Brooklyn while exploring Williamsburg a few weeks ago and I am in LOVE. The building is beautiful and the space is cozy and comfortable. There is an open-concept kitchen to greet you when you first walk in and then a warm and inviting bar to your right. I am still  dreaming about the delicious toasted buns with oyster cream! And the sourdough loaf! And the honeynut squash! okay, I am still dreaming about all of it. I went back a few weeks later for brunch and was super impressed. From the adorable little coffee mugs and creamers to the delicious biscuits and gravy - which I would never typically order but holy cow am I glad that I did - to the sticky bun and avocado toast, I was in heaven. I literally dream about those biscuits and gravy daily. It was super busy at brunch and I enjoyed watching the kitchen in action. I can't wait to go back!!", "Had brunch here with a few friends on a Saturday morning. We were seated right away, and the dining room was not too crowded when we entered. The service was very good and our server was very attentive throughout. The pancakes were unlike any others I've had: crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. With the chocolate sauce on top it was a bit too rich for me, but the brown butter was an excellent topping for the pancakes. I also enjoyed my chai, though I wish it was a bit stronger.

Can't wait to return to try their next menu and I plan on being a regular.\n\nKudos to the whole King team!", "It's a beautiful and intimate restaurant in west SoHo that has a neighbourhood feel.  Everyone is extremely warm and friendly here and you feel welcome right away.\n\nThe menu changes daily so whatever is mentioned here most likely won't be available when you go. It's a small menu inspired from southern France and northern Italy. The dishes we had were generous in portion and quite decadent.\n\nMost appetizers are in the high teens to early $20s. Entrees are in the mid to high $30s.\n\nYou receive a complimentary air flaky cracker / flat bread that's drizzled with olive oil and parsley.\n\nWe had the rabbit cacciatora over polenta $21. This was a very delicious and rich starter and good to share.\n\nThe monkfish came on a bed of white beans $36. The fish was a generous portion and was cooked perfectly.\n\nThe beef was a braised and pulled off and very tender and came with greens $34. I found this dish a tad salty side. The portion was very generous.\n\nAtmosphere is bustling and lively as you can see into the kitchen and seating like at most places are fairly close to the next table.\n\nA good place for those who crave a slight spin on French and Italian fare.", "Heard about King from a lady in an Uber Pool. My boyfriend is from London and his favorite restaurant is the River Cafe, where the chefs come from.\n\nThe restaurant is absolutely lovely and the staff was friendly. We definitely experienced a dining experience that felt the growing pains of a new restaurant - the staff didn't know the menu, the food took quite a while despite small number of patrons. However, once the staff realized my boyfriend was from London, the chef came out and greeted us and was a delight to speak to. The chocolate cake was the best part of the meal.\n\nUltimately, look forward to trying again once they've sorted out the new restaurant kinks.", "I had some time on my hands and decided to stop by King for lunch.\n\nI tried two cocktails and the Lombatello.\n\nLombatello is a hanger steak. I got mine medium rare. It was tender, with moderate chewiness. Beef seemed to have a fresh quality and flavor.  Some bitterness from the charred crust. Minimal salt pepper seasoning.  The rainbow beets and swiss chard were the perfect accompaniments. Beets were sweet and earthy, very soft texture. Chard was cooked until tender, and absorbed the flavor of a parmesan and oil drizzle. A simple but elegant low-key lunch.\n\nThe first cocktail I got was the \"L'Argent de Poche.\" Potent salt-lime flavor. Slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Dry and sour finish from the lime. The ingredient that made me order this was the \"Rhum Agricole,\" but there was not much of a rum flavor here. But, still a good cocktail to sip on.\n\nThe second cocktail is \"Pierrot Le Fou.\" Peach and Hop complexity. Subtle lemon sourness. This IPA and lemon concoction was interesting and refreshing.\n\nI had a delightful lunch at King and give a solid recommendation.", "Small and cozy restaurant in west village. Short but thoughtful menu - displayed quality over quantity.\nHad a delicious Cappellacci di zucca as a starter and shared the Red Snapper grilled with spinach and the Sirloin chargrilled over rosemary branches with smashed ceci - Perfectly light flavour combination which we paired with the delicious Bandol 2006 bottle of wine. Only slight complaint was level of noise and busy servers", "We were so excited to try King but overall disappointed. Started off so positive with their help to extend reservation from 5 to 8 and waive a minimum $ requirement as 50% of our party were non drinking age diners. The seating booked was the cabin, so uncomfortable in the cold temps -the heaters don't provide much heat at all and they are out of blankets so we had to grab them as other tables left. Willing to work through the cold we ordered cocktails, wine and starters...all great and brought to us quickly. What went wrong was our entree food order took over 1.5hrs to arrive and by this time every other table who were seated after us had already come and gone. We were very frustrated by this point, opted to just pay bill for what we'd drank/ate and not wait any longer for entrees abs go somewhere else. The food we did have was great but the discomfort in seating space and extremely long wait for entrees (over 1.5 hrs) makes it a tough one to recommend.", "Had an exceptional meal with the wife last night. The cocktails were inventive, and I look forward to trying the others when we return. Shared the octopus starter, then the guinea hen for two, and then both the date tart and the vin santo parfait. All were were excellent. The sense of joy among the other diners, and the upbeat demeanor of the staff, were unmistakable."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-new-york-3?hrid=uyEmU1P17fRegTdebii6gQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-new-york-3?hrid=3prs6zdZ23Vy88Vmpi5qTQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-new-york-3?hrid=M-YZ4cDlC9hVzrLBkPVxaw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-new-york-3?hrid=Fi9y-rkAxiZPqvjE6-EtGQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-new-york-3?hrid=Fquag-p2nRpdrgZzD8QjBg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-new-york-3?hrid=OZwITTfDH5mqho3c9sGsXA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/king-new-york-3?hrid=yR4rtllERJCD5YhqErSDgQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Pausa", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/pausa-bar-and-cookery-san-mateo/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/san-mateo/restaurant/pausa", "michelin_pov": "Thanks to its modern setting and late hours (by San Mateo standards, at least), a growing crowd of smart couples and tech types flock to this San Mateo sweetie.

A fantastic authentic Italian restaurant (BTW: my husband and I are both Italian).\nThe food was excellent: we had pizza which is made with the best ingredients, Neapolitan crust, baked to perfection in a wood burning oven, just like in Italy. Homemade pasta is delicious. I had chestnut ravioli, filled with kabocha squash, mostarda and amaretti. They reminded me of the ones my Grandmother used to make me in Italy when I was little. So good!\nWe tried many different salumi as appetizer and they were all very good. They are house cured in the restaurant aging room.\nWhatever you have at Pausa you can definitely tell the high quality of its ingredients.\nIt's a contemporary Italian cuisine (it also received a Michelin Bib Gourmand) where excellent ingredients are  put together to create a fabulous and perfect unexpected  combination of flavors that surprise you and leave your mouth watering.\nThis place also has a special vibe and a great service.\nBravo Andrea Giuliani, chef/owner who, with his passion, talent, and dedication delivers authentic, delicious Italian food in the Bay Area.", "This handsome downtown spot has been a terrific addition to the San Mateo restaurant scene. Authentic handmade pasta and Neapolitan style pizzas are a rarity in these parts, but thanks to Pausa no longer require a trip into the City... The chef shrugs off clich\u00e9 preparations in favor of innovative flavor profiles. My favorite is the casarecce pasta served with a ragu of slow-cooked lamb. The pasta itself is infused with the senise pepper from Italy's extreme south, giving it a bright orange color and the dish a zesty hit. Pizzas are equally innovative with toppings in abundance. The cocktails are great too. Servers are knowledgeable and go the extra mile to make customers happy.  My only gripe is around desserts. Originally these were made by the chef and were rather yummy, especially the almond cake with a house-made pistachio Nutella. Sadly, I haven't been wowed by the desserts created by the restaurant's new pastry chef. They are bland, lack cohesion and are a bad value at $12 per serving.", "I'm impressed. I travel all over the country and eat out quite a bit. When I am in the Bay Area it's often hard to find a good upscale dining experience they delivers on quality and flavor. Pausa is now on my list of great places to dine alone or with clients.\n\nI was pleased to find out that all the charcuterie and bread is made in house. The menu is diverse but refined with something for everyone.\n\nOn this visit I brought clients to dinner with me. We split a butcher's board which was outstanding - again all produced in house. I had the steak and it was marvelous. The dish was simple but was focused on flavor. A quality entree. One client also enjoyed the steak while another had a sausage dish with braised cabbage which he said was very enjoyable and flavorful. He told me he'll be back with his wife.\n\nThe other negative reviews about price and amount of food don't seem to make sense to me as this was not my experience. I'd suggest those folks concerned with serving size or price are not used to upscale dining of this quality. Perhaps they'll be more comfortable at the Olive Garden - I hear they have unlimited breadsticks.", "3.5/5\n\nOn one hand, I enjoyed the ambiance and service of this place. Friendly, trendy, the bar vibe with people chatting away. This was a surprise for me since I thought it was going to be more intimate. But then again I came with a party of 9 for a birthday celebration, so maybe it'll depend on your company. Service was good the waitress really knew the items and details to them. Great recommendation on the appetizers too! The truffle honey was, wow. I recommend getting the cheese platter just for the honey.\n\nWhat I wasn't too impressed with was the pizza ( yes I know, that's what everyone is raving about). I think the toppings are high quality, yes, but the crust was not that great despite all the hype. It was soggy from all the great toppings ( I got the chanterelle mushroom pizza--salty salty), to the point where I couldn't even pick it up. For $25/ pizza I expected amazing pizza that fills your mouth with a burst of flavor. With this pizza, I could barely manage to get a meaningful bite in without everything falling off.\n\nDrinks were good, $12/cocktail. Strong and flavorful.\n\nOverall, I'll come back here for drinks and appetizers, and save my money for dinner someplace else.", "Saw some of my friends visiting this establishment for quite sometime and thought it was finally my turn. We made reservation earlier in the day. We arrived a bit early and were accommodated immediately. The customer service was up to par.

What a great way to start the whole food experience at Pausa. Im not to familiar with the Salumi items but will have to try that out next time.\n\nThe entrees finally arrived. (1) The short rib, 48 hours sous vide prior to service. This is pretty much equal to the meat melting in your mouth. They did a great job on the outcome of that dish. Wasn't to fond of the crispy things on the plate but it was great over all. The Margerita pizza was exceptional. Can never go wrong with that pizza. The crust was nice and thin and tasted superb.\n\nLast but not least the BOMBOLONI desert! GOOD LAWDD. this was the bomb.

Chile con queso was delicious, as was the Caesar salad with spicy Caesar dressing and the steak fajitas!\n\nDid you hear about the soft serve machine by the door? It's free for kids and honor system for adults. The money will go to a different local school or park or charity each quarter!!!

Then the chips (are not fresh they are bagged chips) which was confirmed by an employee. The salsa (like Tostitos salsa jar). The guac was way off. The chicken tacos with the refried canned beans and rice a roni rice was a joke. The Al Pastor were more like pull pork again a joke. The waiter had no clue what to say when asked what type of food was this. He stated it was Tex-Mex then said Americanized sad. When asked if we wanted something else we just flat out said no. Not one did he asked what was the issue or what could be done to make it better, just said I can get you something. Asked if we wanted churros on the house no thanks. My companion noticed what I noticed right away (me being Mexican and her Puerto Rican/Ecuadorian) that other non-Latinos were being seated and served immediately. At that point I wanted to speak to the manager but as she said let just leave with dignity. This will be the 1st and last time we ever eat here.

The mimosa flavor tasted of chemicals and was honestly hard to drink, the guac was bland, and the tacos virtually uneatable. The amount of grease on the tacos was honestly stomach turning. My girlfriend literally picked up a taco (she also ordered the chili braised short rib tacos) and squeezed out grease that easily came pouring out of the taco in a steady stream. Please refer to my photos for reference.\n\nI half heartedly ate my side of beans and rice, and tried to salvage what meat I could from the tacos, while avoiding the grease pond on my plate.\n\nWould love to see this place turn out some better food, as I loved the interior.", "This place is something to taco bout.

The d\u00e9cor isn't as nice as Lan, the service not as polished, there's no regular bar, it's a bit more of a pain to get a table but in spite of this I have so far never had anything but great meals there.\n\nThe regular menu is a little limited in some respects, it doesn't overwhelm with choices and funky takes on things just solid Japanese food done well. Every appetizer I've tried I've though were well thought out, and excellently executed (try the garlic beef or spicy chicken). Every entr\u00e9e I've had I've enjoyed immensely, excellent sushi, good udon and soba, and solid if not spectacular grilled seafood. The specials menu kicks it up into high gear with a large bunch of changing items that have yet to disappoint.\n\nThe waitstaff are hip Japanese kids who are way cooler than you or me but don't act it too much, service is diligent but not necessarily warm. The d\u00e9cor is a little better than generic for this type of place in this type of location.\n\nWell worth the reasonable check", "Elegant Japanese food place with amazing sushi and cha-soba sets.\n\nUpon entering through a small wooden door, the new world I entered immediately bring me to Japan - Simple and natural wooden decorations, jazz music playing in the background, quiet yet agreeable atmosphere.\n\nMy friend ordered eel over rice ($22 with salad and miso soup) and I ordered cha-soba set ($18). It contains salad, main dish over rice and hot/cold soba. The salad dressing is amazing - rich, a little sour with great aroma (Tastes like sesame, thousands island sauce plus some secret ingredients!), which really opened up my appetite. My main dish is delish seared salmon and salmon roe over sushi rice, hot soba, and plum marinated veggies. The seared salmon is rich, tender - one of the best I've ever had. The hot cha-soba is hearty made, coming with slightly sour soup and spinach and scallions on top. The noodle contains good amount of cha-aroma. I also tried my friend's eel over rice - eel is super tender and fatty. Lastly, a perfect ending - hot tea to waken us from the satisfaction of this delish meal.\n\nThe price is really fair given the fantastic quality of the meal and the satisfaction I had. I would see myself come back more often to try other dishes.", "Good sign when the restaurant is almost entirely Japanese, both diners and staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Casual and reasonably priced. We started off with a tempura appetizer and this was by far the best tempura I've had. So flaky and perfectly cooked.\nSide salad was generous with a nice mix of greens, tomatoes and thin shreds of carrots along with their homemade ginger dressing. Red miso soup was unique and delicious.\nMy friend's beef appetizer which was thinly sliced and perfectly tender was also very good. I went with a sushi combo which came with a about 5 nigiri pieces and 2 rolls and soup and salad. The standout was the nigiri. Holy moly, best tuna, salmon and yellowtail I've ever had. So unbelievably fresh it literally melts in your mouth. The spicy tuna roll was really good, but the yellowtail and scallion roll was almost too onion-y for me. I would come back and do nigiri and sashimi. The fish is so superb, it almost needs to stand on its own. I'm having a hard time being back home and left to our 'best' sushi. Until next time, Hasaki. I will be dreaming of the delicious sushi I had.", "Went during lunch time and was surprised that none of their lunch set has sea urchin - even chirashi or kaisen don!\n\nLook at this little sad bowl of Chirashi. Fish was good quality and sushi rice was seasoned well though.

I usually order a la carte and get a salad, sushi, some sake, of course, and a little bit of MFFITWW.  My partner always gets the omakase and leaves it up to the chef, and it's always fresh and delicious.\n\nI can be a grump sometimes about noise, and sometimes I just want a quiet restaurant.  I work hard!  I'll take a chill, intimate place over Buddakan any day.  Here, the dining room is so calm and mellow, it makes it a pleasant place to be.   The restaurant is located down a flight of stairs from the street, so it is super discreet, which I also like.\n\nI do wish they took reservations, but this grump likes to eat early anyway, so it usually works out.", "What a pretty, underground restaurant in the heart of the East Village.  \n\nWe came for the sushi mid-week just before heading to Stomp, around the corner. The Uni was the highlight of the meal, per my guest.  At $15 a piece, we were glad for that!\n\nOther vegetarian highlights were the platter of mushrooms sauteed in sake, butter, and soy: Enoki, hen of the woods, shiitake, and a couple of others were fresh and savory.  The agedashi tofu was OKI - a sizeable portion - but not much different from any other place.  The seaweed salad consisted of at least three different kinds was tasty, but tiny.  \n\nOverall, the vegetarian options here are few and expensive, but they can make for a good meal if your pals have sushi cravings in a pretty lace when in the village.", "My favorite sushi in the area.

They have some outside seating that isn't affiliated with the restaurant, but is generally open for those who want to grab a pizza to-go instead of waiting for an official table.\n\nI've had the pepperoni, meat lovers, and the carbonara pizzas. The pepperoni is my favorite, mostly because they pile it on! The pizza itself is thin, but still has a pretty thick crust. I prefer the marinara base, which you can also order on the side.\n\nIt's obvious that the service is what sets this place apart. A man in front of us in line accidentally took our order, and we were left with a few pizzas we didn't order (you can't go wrong--so it was totally fine with us!). We didn't make a big deal about it, and the generous staff brought us a free cookie for the trouble.

We were craving breakfast and pizza at the same time so we found a solution in Bettina's Carbonara pizza! Using naturally leavened sourdough for their pizza & breads, this Neopolitan with a Californian twist pizza definitely had a unique taste. You appreciate every moment from the time it enters the wood fired oven to the time the bubbling, house-made cheese on a crispy crust is set before you.\nNow the cake was extremely rich & thick, be prepared to order another of whatever you're drinking.

It is baked with an egg, pancetta, mozzarella and  pecorino cheese among other things. The Maitake Mushroom pizza was divine. Delicious mushrooms that went great with the basil and crushed tomatoes. The pepperoni pizza was raised to a new level with honey and chili oil, so good. Plenty of scrumptious, crispy pepperoni's.

We ordered several pizzas to feed the family, which also includes impatient kids.  I got there at the designated time, which was already an hour or so after the order was placed. I started by standing outside and waiting for someone to open the door, as it was unclear whether I was supposed to walk in or not.  After a few minutes, I tried calling the number on the door.  Called twice.  I got an answering machine that didn't indicate I had reached a number associated with the restaurant.  I was careful to confirm the number, but I don't know who I was calling.  When I got to talk to someone, I was told \"12 more minutes.\"  It ended up a little while longer than that. Meanwhile, I walked to Vons to buy some snacks to hold the kids over.  I mean, I'm the grand scheme of things, going 20 minutes over on an order that's already supposed to take an hour might not be the worst thing, but to the several of us standing around our here, it's pretty annoying.

And a variety of lounge and bar seating. We arrived between lunch and dinner so we ordered food from the bar menu.\n\nThe crudit\u00e9s with miso dip were lovely. We had the  trout and the beef burger. The former came with cucumber in dill sauce and the burger with polenta fries, and lettuce tomato and avocado trimmings.

My only gripe with them is they barely have any options for vegetarians / vegans except some breakfast bowls and of course avocado toast.\nThey are also unable to customize your request when it comes to food like I wanted my eggs Benedict without smoked ham..

Tried the spanakopita, super flaky crust and delicious filling. The chicken was extremely well priced - $31 for a huge portion with sides and everything (half chicken?

Located in the old Cybelle's Pizza at the base of Piedmont, the place is quaint, with attentive staff.\n\nNow seeing pictures on Yelp, it seems we experienced a new menu. Everything was delicious--Fresh, unique combinations. We ordered several sharing plates. My favorites were the fresh figs with a soft cheese, the trout with thinly sliced eggplant, and the stuffed pasta in brown butter with bread crumbs and blueberries. Portions looked small, but surprisingly fed a few servings for the 4 of us. Dishes ranges from $12-$22. We also ordered the table tri-tip topped with chilaquiles and black bean pur\u00e9e. Beautifully presented and the meat was a perfect medium rare- $55.\n\nDesserts were yummy- buckwheat almond cake with strawberries and ice cream. The Star was a miniature whole peach pie with verbena ice cream. They also brought complementary sugar cookies and a lit candle - nice touch for the birthday boy.\n\nDelightful evening. $257 before tip including libations for all 4 of us. Not bad.\n\nDefinitely worth a try.", "This was a spectacular restaurant before Covid, and it is still just as good. The patio is comfortable and the service is excellent. As usual, the food was so good that we did not want the meal to end. Each course was unique and perfectly done.\nWe like the food so much that we ordered the take out Thanksgiving meal. It takes a great chef and staff to create and pack a meal the day before it is to be eaten, and still have it be good when it is reheated. There were explicit directions on how to heat the food, and we were not disappointed. Everything was so very good, especially the turkey. They made sausage from the dark meat and stuffed the thighs meat with the sausage. It was then baked and fried. The white meat was brined and then grilled on the wood grill. The turkey gravy was the best I have had. I don't usually have a salad with the Thanksgiving meal. but we were glad we had this one.\nI cannot say enough about the quality of this restaurant.", "Ambience:  light, not too noisy ; eye catching wall fresco.  Note however that couples may have a hard time reserving a separate table: for them the bar section is best).\n\nService:   Friendly, not at all stuffy.\n\nFood:  excellent, but skimpy portions.    Two of us shared tiny rabbit legs, fantastic eclairs filled with liver pate, a superlative summer salad (sliced peaches, cucumber, tomatoes, radishes), and \"Nashville\" soft shell crabs. The latter, spicy and crunchy, were beyond perfect.\n\nWine:   Interesting but pricy. We had the 3B Portuguese sparkling rose, served very cold, as it should be.  At $46, about 3x retail.   Most wine list suggestions were $50+, or $16+ per glass.\n\nWe skipped dessert.   Bill came to about $120.  One of us was still hungry.", "My partner and I enjoyed a celebratory dinner at M\u00e4go last night on Piedmont Ave in Oakland. Mark Liberman opened the  micro-seasonal restaurant in June and my only regret is that we didn't go sooner. The menu, which changes weekly, is imaginative and perfectly prepared with many vegetarian options. I never thought I would swoon over carrots, but when, at the suggestion of our charming server, we ordered the roasted carrots with sprouted grains, passion fruit coulis and black sesame paste, I discovered what seemed like a new vegetable. Many other options on the small plate menu from shishito peppers with sesame to pork ribs, trout with eggplant and chanterelles with fried brown rice were richly layered in flavor and texture. The staff was friendly and helpful. They even offered us a complementary after-dinner Sicilian Moscato because we enjoyed the meal so much.", "I became a huge fan of Chef Mark Lieberman back when he opened AQ In San Francisco. My wife and I were really bummed when he moved and chose to close up so imagine our delight when we found out he was opening a new place in Oakland!  Well to no surprise to us the food is spectacular and the cocktails and wine list are on point.  I'd actually lived in the neighborhood on Piedmont ave where his new location is and was pleasantly surprised with what he did with the space that used to occupy what is now M\u00e4go. In addition they added a back patio for outdoor dining which has been great during this covid pandemic.  We live in Sausalito and make the drive over for the curbside at least once a month during covid and it's been perfect.  They even have cocktails to go but the patio is open now and I believe they are doing some indoor seating as well.  All fresh local and in season. Chef Lieberman and his team are doing great things. It's a definite must if your able to make it!  I'm certain my wife will write a review as well and hers will undoubtedly have photos attached as she was snapping lots of pics of his creations. Thanks Chef", "We had a wonderful meal here last night and will definitely be back. We sat overlooking the kitchen area which was fun because we saw a few things that looked delicious that we might not have ordered had we not seen the first. We shared the zucchini with burrata, sweet corn agnolotti, and okonomiyaki (which I have never had before, but was delicious). Everything was fantastic. We finished with the cherry clafoutis, which was pretty tasty, but maybe I would try the rocky road dessert next time (or cheeses!!) In addition, the service was great.

They try to make it so that your meal flows well and is enjoyed as best as possible.\n\nThe cocktails are perfectly crafted so I'd recommend starting with a round of cocktails before dining.\n\nThe best items on the menu are the chicken liver pate and the mussels and clams. Both of these dishes make you want to finish every last bite. You can ask for more bread, but they are very stingy with it and will only bring you one slice at a time. You should keep asking for it though to fully enjoy those dishes.\n\nOverall I am giving this restaurant 5 stars for the food and atmosphere. The service however was not the best, luckily their food makes up for it. The server like I said was stingy with the bread and seemed annoyed if we ordered more of it...she also was in a bad mood when we asked her any questions about items on the menu (maybe she was having a bad day?)\n\nDespite ok service I would fully recommend this place for the quality of the food!", "Bestia has an extensive menu and drink list with near-excellent service. It's tasty food in a lively environment; somewhat resembling a New York-style eatery. I'm a fan, yet not overeager to return to this trendy Italian restaurant.

How I pray that they expand and create more and more dishes for me to try. And this place is kind of affordable. But maybe I'm so obsessed I  will pay anything for these dishes. Oops. I would spend my rent money on it.\n\nNo lie, I have tried every single dish on the menu at least 5 times. Fresh, consistent, and orgasmic every single time. I have been going since they opened. You will never ever ever find another restaurant as well done and perfected.

We love Bestia  we've been here a few times and loved the Mussels and Roasted Bone Marrow. The mussels are cooked perfectly in a spicy broth with toasty rustic bread. We always save the broth to eat with our other meals. The bone marrow is very decadent. It looks like a small portion but it's not. The margherita pizza was good but we've had better. Very fresh tasting though. The grilled fish was the most surprising! We were hesitant on getting this but saw how popular it is on Yelp. We gave it a try and it's delicious. It's deboned which is wonderful. Very lemony and full of flavor. Highly recommend checking this place out but reservations are needed.", "Finally made reservations and discovered that the Cocktails and Desserts were divine!\n\nDuring our first trip here we opted to try many more of their smaller dishes than 1 big entree.\n\nThe salumi board - All their meats are made in house. They had one of the better mortadella I've had as well an interesting take on Nduja, which was a white nonspicy version of the original.\n\nThe little Gem salad - Classic Nice and Bright.\n\nAlla 'Nduja' - Although we were warned, the Nduja had a surprisingly good amount of spicy/heat. It was a good pizza but nothing special.  Likely would avoid ordering any of the pizza again.  \n\nPotato Leek Ravioli - Potato and Leek soup stuffed into a ravioli! Perfectly boiled and al dente.\n\nSpaghetti with Crab - Pasta and sauce was good, but the crab seem a little superfluous\n\nBlueberry & Lemon Frozen Torte - Crazy delicious. It was light, bright, and sweet.\n\nChocolat Bittersweet Chocolate Tarte: a chocolate lover dream. Rich and not too sweet.\n\nCocktails\nThe Cactus Cooler: Light cool and refreshing\n\nIncantation: Sweet girly drink\n\nVictoria's Secret: least favorite - it had a weird bitter finished\n\nOld Fashioned: Classic, what you would expect.", "THE LOBSTER CROSTINO!!!!! my favorite...\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty crowded - it felt like there were too many tables for the amount of space there was.

Make sure to make a reservation in advance.\n\nWe ordered:\nLobster Crostino - I honestly had no expectations for this one but it was my favorite. I don't even know how to describe the flavor of this.\n\nRoasted Marrow Bone - This is the one everyone orders and takes a picture/video of. Definitely get this one it's also very delicious.

The lamb sausage is thinly sliced, pink in color, a little reminiscent of pepperoni, lightly citrusy, crispy, nicely done, not really lamb-y.  The handcut fries are perfectly crispy.  It's served on a little hot skillet.  \n\nAs for mains, I've tried and just fallen in love with each of the following:  \n- The manti, miniature raviolis stuffed with ground beef in a garlicky yoghurt sauce.  They're addictively good.  \n- The ali nazik:  yoghurt and eggpplant puree on the base which is luscious and creamy, topped with really flavorful stewed ground beef, stewed tomatoes, and topped with more punchy yoghurt.  It's just divine.", "I think I would give this 3.5 stars.  The food was pretty good but not exceptional.  The appetizers were much stronger than the entrees.  In terms of appetizers, the hummus, cazik, and shepherd salad with feta were the strong points.  The fava beans were kind of lacking.  Of all of those, the shepherd salad was the best.\n\nFor an entree I had a shrimp kebab plate served with rice and a garden salad.  While the quality was obviously there, it wasn't much more than you can get from a run-of-the-mill greek or turkish place for $7 at a lunch special.  There are also no beers on draft.\n\nThe thing I was pleasantly surprised with were the desserts.  The baklava was excellent (we ordered 3), they brought rice pudding for free which was nice, and there were also some sweet cookies that were very good (cant remember exactly what they were)\n\nGiven that I am not really a dessert person, and I dont get tons of cravings for this type of food, I probably wont be back.  Nothing wrong with the spot whatsoever though.", "Great complimentary bread, yummilicious hummus, and the lamb pizza was really unique (in a good way).

And a plate of good quality olive oil.  \n\nThe lamb chops were delish.  Excellently prepared, so that the chops were still pink and tender inside.  They were simply cooked with garlic.  Some cilantro was tossed on top for freshness and some acid (maybe lemon?).  A great balance of flavors.  Take a bit of the chop, and then a piece of the roasted tomato and a little bit of rice.  Mmmm.  There was also a bed of red lettuce, romaine, and field greens that was tossed in a light dressing and sprinkled with pepper and kosher salt.

Or I could go on and on about three versions of rice (the barberry, the sour cherry, and especially the orange peel and almond).  But it was the appetizers which totally won me over, if only because they arrive first.  For eggplant we had the igra (a dip) and the Kashk-e-Bademjan (sliced).  So my only question is how they manage to get the eggplant so perfectly smoky, yet complementing all the other flavors.  On the other hand, the lebni (kefir cheese) was rich and creamy.  The dolmas were great as was an appetizer of carrot and red bell pepper.  I am not a hummus person at all.  Theirs, coming with a separate, rich topping of fried onions, converted me (at least to their version).  They staff are also really nice.  Have I left anything out?  If it weren't for location, the place would have an awful line outside.

I have eaten hundreds of ribeyes in my life, this was by far the best I have ever had.  We had a wedge salad and the double baked truffle potato as sides.  The potato was literally engulfed in actual black truffle shavings.  I was expecting just truffle oil or a couple shavings.  I wish I had a photo to post but we ate everything pretty quickly.

The waiter, Anthony, was remarkably well versed in the intricate menu and commanded it with effortless recall. His advice was tailored well and made sense to us. We listened to him and appreciated his guidance. The seafood was terrific here, but the highlight was, of course, the steak. We had a veal tomahawk, and a Wagyu ribeye \"Cap\" steak, respectively.  Both were incredible. What I thought was just a parlor trick, the steaks are served on a 500-degree hot plate, turned out to make a huge difference in keeping the proteins at perfect serving temperature long throughout the actual dining process. I'm surprised more don't use this approach in the service of expensive proteins.\n\nIt is expensive, but no more so than its peers.

They've got a awesome selection of mezcals. Certainly one of the best I've seen and our waitress made a great recommendation for me.\n\nFor starters, we shared their signature black ant guacamole and grasshopper tacos. The guacamole was one of the best I've had. It reminded me of the one I had at xixa in Williamsburg a couple years back. The grasshopper tacos is probably the dish for which insects are most prominent. I didn't pick up too much flavorful from the grasshopper; I mostly got a crunchy texture from them.

The appetizers we ordered were guacamole which was garnished with pomegranate seeds and apples, an additional side of shishito peppers.

The reservation process was smooth and easy, and Matthew,our server, was AMAZING!  Great recommendations, helpful without being overbearing, the Sommelier (I didn't get his name, I'm sorry) was also very nice. The food was awesome, and both Matthew's recommendation for the Pappardelle with Braised Duck and the accompanying wine recommendation were on point. The Chocolate Oblivion Cake was to die for!  The olive oil on top and the sea salt are something I crave!  I've been to Sociale for work functions and our department holiday party, but this was the first time for me in the restaurant, as opposed to the private dining area. I will definitely be a return customer!", "The atmosphere is chic and quaint.  Part of what is appealing is that the restaurant is tucked at the end of a walkway and the only sign is a dark green awning.  There is an outdoor eating area that is covered and open even when raining (nice toasty heaters make the experience all the better).  Parking in Laurel Heights is always a nightmare (don't make the mistake of parking at the village as I did...you will get a ticket). OK, now for the food.. sooo yummy.  Real rustic Italian fare that I have not seen anywhere else.  Wild boar ravioli, duck with parpadelle (a little salty), bone marrow on toast, fish and chips with real chips.  As they do take credit cards, they do not take AMEX so business lunches are more limited.   Overall the food is decent, eclectic, and inexpensive... however stars are docked for parking and cc limitations (hey man, I want my miles!)", "Sociale is in the Laurel Heights neighborhood and tucked away in an alley. It was so cute! They had a little garden area with heat lamps and indoor seating. The food was amazzzinnng!\n\nWe started with:\nWHITE BEAN CROSTINO\nArugula salad, shaved parmigiano-reggiano\n\nand\n\nCRAB TIMBALE\nEnglish pea pur\u00e9e, shallots, chives, lemon vinaigrette\nMy fiance had the LIGURIAN FISH STEW\nTilapia, prawns, Dungeness crab, roasted onion, potato, fennel pollen tomato broth\n\nand I had the SEARED PETRALE SOLE\nStuffed with rock shrimp, asparagus, fingerling potatoes, lemon beurre blanc\n\nEverything was delicious. The sole was cooked well and that lemon beurre blanc sauce that accompanied with it was soooo good.\n\nWe skipped dessert since we were so full. The other great thing about this restaurant is that there was a ton of parking, right on the street!!\n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant and hope to come back and sit in the garden!", "It's the warm lighting and the quaint, enclosed (read: not windy and cold) patio that make this a hidden gem in the neighborhood.  Fried olives are heavenly, as are most things salty, stuffed with cheese and deep-fried.

Fantastic food and amazing service. I came here with high expectations after reading reviews and I must say that they were all met.\n\nStarted with the buffalo milk mozzarella, which was truly unlike any other cheese appetizer I have had. It comes on a bed of tuna, unexpected but absolutely delicious.\n\nThey have an option where you can try three different pastas. (The deal is 3 pastas for $68) Of course my friend and I love to eat and wanted to try different pastas so we did this option. We went with the cacio e Pepe, the gnocchi, and the beet ravioli. I was absolutely blown away by all of these choices. Each dish was so creative and so special, truly unlike other pastas that I have had. I honestly can't decided which one was my favorite, I absolutely loved the ravioli, but I am a sucker for anything with goat cheese!!\n\nWe also got a side of the cauliflower, which we probably could have done without because we had so much food. For dessert we had the Italian soft serve swirl, which was truly magical. Such a nice way to end the meal.\n\nSuch a fantastic experience and will absolutely be going back!", "Enjoyed dinner with colleagues after a busy work day. Everything was delicious! I started with the Sfolower cocktail which was as tasty as it was beautiful! We shared a number of small plates, including the burrata, the meatballs, and the grilled spicy wild calamari. I particularly enjoyed the calamari - incredibly flavorful and delicious! The small plates were the real standout of the evening.\n\nFor my entree, I had the pappardelle with lamb ragu. The ragu was rich and the pasta was perfect! It was a popular dish in the group with one person swapping out the pappardelle for gnocchi. Other entrees ordered included the BBQ Pork Rib Tortellini and the Tagliatelle Amalfi Coast - everyone enjoyed. We finished with a variety of desserts. The Tiramisu, Chocolate Piemontese Cake, and Soft Serve (swirl of vanilla and peach) were all delicious.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is delightful. Unexpectedly, the interior decoration reminded me of several restaurants I enjoyed in Poland. Cozy and slightly Scandinavian. Service was lovely, and while busy the restaurant didn't feel overcrowded or loud. I'm looking forward to returning!", "The pasta is very good - like, legit, I feel like I'm in Rome good. Its fresh, not overcooked, and the sauce is as it should be. The pastas are also 22-25 bucks a plate...So for three pastas, a bottle of wine and a dessert, its like $60/person. ITS PASTA!\n\nDessert was terrible - panna cotta that was lemony with a dark chocolate sauce. It was a complete mess on the palate.\n\nService there was fine - when trying to make a booking they are not terribly helpful. There are seats at the bar, and they make it sound like every seat is booked. When we arrived with a party of three on a sleepy Monday at 6pm, the terrace and main room easily had 20 covers...so not sure what that's about.\n\nIs it excellent? sure. Is it worth a return? Boh.", "The pasta was really good but I really enjoyed the sides.  We had meatballs, grilled calamari and octopus and roasted cauliflower. Nothing was deep fried (for a change) and the dishes were simple, well prepared and delicious.  My favorite was the grilled whole baby calamari.\n\nAs for pasta, I was in the mood for something simple and my classic tonnarelli with cheese hits the spot. The tonnarelli is thicker than spaghetti and the pecorino is melted at the bottom.\n\nWe were celebrating a graduation so the restaurant brought out a few desserts on the house which was a nice touch.\n\nOverall it was a very enjoyable meal with nice service in a comfortable setting.", "We had reservations, but the greeter didn't realize this, even after giving her my last name.\nIt was my birthday dinner and my partner said he'd called ahead to arrange a little something special. Nothing happened, not even a cupcake with a candle, nada.\nAnyway, we shared the roasted asparagus, pea polenta and grilled squid for appetizers. The polenta had way too many peas and was over-cheesed. Also was runny, almost like potato puree.\n(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Po\u2026)\nThe squid was tasty.  I had their pasta special, tomato and bacon sauce. Very little bacon. It was served hot. A plus for me. Had to ask the waiter for bread and Parmesan cheese. We'd had too much to eat for dinner, so we just perused the dessert list. I had a glass of Napa chardonnay at $19.00 a pop. It was very oaky and thick. The interior was comfy. The service good. I really prefer my pasta on a plate versus in a cereal bowl. No need to return. The prices way too high for what one receives.", "I have mixed feelings about Sfoglina. The service was only ok; it wasn't terrible but also wasn't great. I felt the same way about our food. We started with the cucumber salad, which was actually really good. It had a nice creamy dill sauce that wasn't overpowering with a hint of spice from the chili oil. The radishes were a nice touch too. I'm not sure it was worth its $16 price tag, but it was good. For pastas, we had carbonara and the Amatriciana cavetelli. Both were really good, but again maybe a little overpriced. The cavetelli had a nice spice to it and the carbonara was nice and rich. We also split some desserts - the tiramisu (the best of the three), the hazelnut cake (not bad, but a little dry), and the sandwich cookies (kind of terrible - not a lot of flavor and very dry). All in all our meal wasn't bad, but it seemed expensive for what it was. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.", "I saw this restaurant while walking around Rossyln and wanted to give it a try. Atmosphere is very cute but the food was not up to par for the price.

Loud tunes set the tone here, where you\u2019re expected to order, slurp and move on.\nThis kitchen is famed for its ramen, like the shoyu, showcasing springy noodles topped with bean sprouts, fatty chashu, toasted nori, and nitamago. Sapporo ramen is equally big on flavor, with white miso tare and togarashi; but it's the mugi-miso that brings home the gold, thanks to yuzu kosho and chili spice.", "yelp_reviews": ["I'm not sure if there are separate listings for the izakaya and the ramen part of the restaurant but I'll combine my review into one. The upstairs is an izakaya type restaurant. To make it simple, they sell Japanese version of tapas. Small dishes that won't get you full if you eat like me. We got there around dinner time and were seated immediately. Ordered four dishes and had some beer with a friend. Food was delicious; my favorite was probably the age-kara which is pretty gourmet Japanese style chicken nuggets. Nice place, I would probably come back for drinks since they have a really big selection.  We were still hungry so we went downstairs and to have some ramen. The wait was like 15 minutes and it was around 7pm on a Tuesday. There isn't any separate seating so if you're not prepared to sit next to other people this isn't for you. The kitchen is at the back of the restaurant and you can see it prepared. Everything is fresh and the ramen was delicious. I ordered the spicy miso but I heard all of them tastes pretty good. I would probably pass on the dumplings next time though. Loved the restaurant overall and will definitely come back.", "There's always a wait at Daikaya, and the ramen shop does not take reservations (unlike their izakaya upstairs). However, add your name to the waitlist and they'll give you a text when they're ready for you.\n\nSeating: They have about 10 counter seats, 2 booths, and 4 short rows of communal seating. All in all it's not a huge place, but they do have a fun interior. I've sat in the communal seating area and the counter, but I think I enjoy the counter more where I get to see how they make their ramen.\n\nRamen: They use the thick, wavy noodles here which are always a good chewy consistency. I do wish their chashu was a little more tender and smoky. The broth is extremely salty and strong, so the chashu just blends in with their other ingredients like the ground pork and bean sprouts (so unfortunate!). Finally, their ramen is way too salty. I always find myself drinking bottles after bottles of water after a meal at Daikaya. I've had the shoyu, spicy miso, and mugimiso, and all three were equally salty for me.", "Yes, if you have only had instant ramen .. then this place will blow you away, BUT if you have had ramen made at home or even from a decent Japanese/Korean restaurant, this is on-par or good to pretty good\n\nNO RESERVATIONS.... sucks.  \n\nWe had kids in tow who are picky eaters to begin with, but what kid doesnt like noodles?\nBONUS - the restaurant brought us some kiddie bowls (IKEA) and that made life a LOT easier.  \n\nWe had:\nSHOYU RAMEN\nIn keeping with Sapporo ramen tradition, we use very dark rich soy sauce in our shoyu ramen.

The sauce was flavorful, but there was a brunt note to it that made it a little bit...off\n\nSPICY MISO RAMEN\nOur spicy miso ramen broth has balance, depth and complexity. It is not just simply spicy. We use shiro-miso, which is white miso, for this ramen. This ramen contains peanuts\n$14.00\n\nEXTRA VEGGIES\nBrussel Sprouts, Snow Peas, Carrots, Wood Ear Mushrooms\n$2.50\n\nThis ramen was delicious. we liked the pungent flavor from the miso and enjoyed the complex broth.\n\nworth trying.", "Stopped in for lunch today. The wait was long, even at 11:45 a.m., and it was torture to watch all the steaming bowls of soup pass by. (I recommend waiting elsewhere -- either in a bar nearby or the Smithsonian American Art Museum.)\n\nWe had the shio ramen (GOOD - broth was a bit innocuous) and the shoyu ramen (GREAT - flavorful and rich). They do not offer the fatty goodness that is tonkatsu ramen, but that's probably for the best -- lighter broth, more subtle. The chashu (sliced pork) did not have much flavor, but the pork crumbles were excellent bursts of flavor.\n\nThe gyoza were excellent -- nice mix of chewy and crunchy, with an excellent pork filling.\n\nThe vibe is solid: a bustling, industrial feel with funky lighting and tables. Lively without being a shouting match -- especially since the seats are close to each other. Service was attentive and friendly.\n\nOverall:\n\"Very good\"", "As a self-proclaimed Ramen hunter, I found Daikaya Ramen to be a pleasant surprise in the heart of DC.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of the small interior clashed with the sounds of roaring pots, sake being poured, chatter, and the ecstatic slurping of noodles. Although the wait was a little long, it was definitely worth it. My waitress was kind, sweet, and added to the harmonious vibes of the Ramen bar.\n\nI ordered the Shio Ramen, consisting of imported Sapporo noodles immersed in a Chintan stock. Though simplistically topped with roast pork, chashu, bean sprouts, onions, garlic, ground pork, nori, and scallions, the first flavor that hit my palate was the sheer intensity and magical-nature of the broth. Its clarity and deep flavor profile was absolutely sublime, giving off notes of infused bone. The noodles, however, were the star of the bowl. The egg noodles were glutinous, mildly elastic, ridiculously fresh, and fragrant of wheat and eggs. The texture could not be beat. Combined with the toppings and broth, the Shio Ramen was a delight to eat.\n\nDaikaya Ramen is truly a place that is worthwhile the $15 investment and trip. Not enough words can be used to describe the Feng shui of the establishment and ramen.", "I finally tried the ramen shop for an early lunch, after eating upstairs more times than I can count.  It was a cold day, so it hit the spot.  The broth was very salty, even by my standards, but not unbearably so.   I got a decent portion of pork, but primarily the Mugi Miso broth I had is onion/shallot and bean sprouts.  \n\nIt was delicious. Prices could be a bit lower for the hurried and cramped experience, considering they are just ladling the broth into bowls and topping it.

It's got a delicate, but crunchy crust that is to die for.

Don't get the 1/2 soup + sandwich combo, you'll have a huge empty place in your heart where the other 1/2 sandwich should be. Sandwich, fries, and a coke - perfect meal.

After being with her in the car and opening the takeout, and then eating a slice of that pastrami, and a couple more pieces...I understood.\n\nAs explained on their website, hot pastrami is a select cut of beef, sugar-cured and seasoned as corned beef, then slowly smoked for tenderness and tantalizing taste and flavor, then covered with choice and costly spices.\n\nThe taste is definitely very tantalizing and you just can't help but eat more and more. The juices in each slice, and it's like you can't stop. We ended up also ordering this from goldbelly for my mother's birthday. She and my dad loved it!", "At last!  A place I can count on for \"tantalizing\" pepper-crusted pastrami.  Got to be the best I've had.  Too bad they're not in Northern California....but heck, it's way worth the drive down the 5.  \n\nI had the #19 (pastrami, coleslaw, swiss, with Russian dressing on rye), the most popular sandwich on the menu...with reason!  The hot pastrami was perfectly slow-cooked (tender) and seasoned, with the right amount of fat.  \n\nThe Brisket of Beef open faced sandwich was incredible.  With a mountain of beef on the large plate, we couldn't see any of the bread at the bottom.  The brisket, with gravy, was tender and full of flavor....melted in my mouth.  \n\nThe #88 (hot corned beef, sauerkraut and swiss grilled on rye) was a force to be reckoned with...with savory corned beef, and lots of it!\nThe crinkle-cut fries and potato pancakes were wonderful additions to our meal.    \n \nVisiting on a Saturday afternoon, we didn't have to wait long.

Everything we ordered was perfectly made and packaged up great!  The only question I have is why is the bread for the sandwich different from the corn rye that you buy by the loaf at Langer's.

The space is warm and open while retaining a cosy intimacy. Fresh white table cloths and flowers adorn every table along with candles for the evening diners. The food is Italian and Mediterranean in style and uses a lot of local organic produce in preparation. I've sampled most things on the menu but the stand out signature dish is the lasagna, I know that sounds boring but you need to taste it. Homemade Italian sausage in a rich tomato sauce with cheese and herbs, it's so delicious! All the pasta dishes are excellent and the pizza (sausage is my favorite) is outstanding with thin crust to boot. There is a very comprehensive wine list or you can pay corkage and bring your own. I will admit that we eat here for more special occasions than the 'can't be bothered to cook tonight' visit but no matter what the occasion it's always a treat. Love Pasta Moon.", "This restaurant has a great mixed-used space, including a dining room, a lounge, a music room,and a pasta kitchen.  Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable about the food and wine.\n\nMy friend and I had the fritto misto, linguine with seafood, and lasagna.  The pasta was fresh handmade pasta.  It was well done here with the right amount of bite.  It was not too egg-ey as some places are.  You know, the places that make it like Chinese noodles.  The fritto misto was a good mix of items, and fried perfectly crispy with little oil residue.  The menu listed olives as one of the items, but I couldn't find it in the mix.  The linguine was coated in a garlic olive oil sauce.  I wish it had been with a cream sauce.  The lasagna was amazing!  Exactly as a lasagna should be, italian sausage meat sauce, and fresh lasagna pasta.  The pasta was rolled thinly, which made this hearty dish quite delicate to the bite.  Just amazing!", "Decided to go for date night in Half Moon Bay. Feels like the perfect spot from the South Bay -- a nice drive over the mountains and then a nice meal. And based on the reviews on Yelp, this seemed like the perfect spot to go.\n\nUnfortunately, Pasta Moon didn't deliver.\n\nIt wasn't so much that there was anything wrong. There wasn't. It's just that there wasn't anything *right*.\n\nThe fritto misto was well fried, though the seafood wasn't so great. The clam chowder wasn't that creamy. The spaghetti vongole didn't come together at all -- it felt like a whole bunch of ingredients had been dropped together on a plate; pasta, shells, broth. And the pappardelle that everyone on here seems so excited about... it was ok. Certainly wasn't great.\n\nAnd it's not like the serving sizes were so big that it, on some level, made up for it. Instead of going for dessert, we went for mussels simply because we were still kind of hungry.\n\nI'm afraid that in so many senses, Pasta Moon epitomises three stars. Not terrible. Not great. It's just... average.", "UNREAL MEAL, so so good! I am fortunate to eat very yummy food pretty consistently, but wow this meal was amazing.\nPasta Moon is located in Half Moon Bay's downtown (Main Street) which is such a cute are. FYI I believe ~September 2019 the restaurant will be moving down Main Street only by a couple blocks in order to have a bigger kitchen and parking lot.\nDishes you must get--Pear & Prosciutto Pizza and the Pappardelle Pancetta. Both dishes were simple but the flavors were incredible. The pizza was a great appetizer, but I also could easily get that as a main dish.\nOther dishes we had that were also super delicious--Linguini Ahi Tuna, this is a great lighter pasta dish. The House made Sausage Pizza, very very good. The lunch special was Halibut with Cornbread (you could see the real corn in it!!), and Ratatouille. For dessert I recommend the Ghirardelli Butterscotch Pudding but the Mascarpone Cheesecake was delicious with chocolate sauce and hazelnuts to top!\nSo excited to come back for more good service but most importantly amazing food!", "All pastas were homemade...which I LOVE...however, my seared ahi liinguine was a little salty. We had a great charcuterie/antipasto plate to start, and that was lovely. The wine list is literally ALL Italian wines, most of which 99% of Americans will not be acquainted with...Therefore, ask your server what's yummy...Hopefully, they'll steer you in the right direction. We went here for our anniversary weekend, and, on a Friday night, the place was packed to the brim with tons of people waiting. We had arranged a res through our B&B, but we waited for a 1/2 hour nonetheless.

I haven't reviewed them before, even though they are a tried and true favorite.  But on my latest outing, a little extra service inspired me to spread the word.\n\nI wanted a veggie pasta and the one option on the menu (squash ravioli, I think) wasn't quite what I was looking for.  No worries.  The server was completely comfortable with me mixing and matching pasta, sauce and vegetables from the other choices and even suggested a couple of ingredients not on the menu.  The result was just perfect.\n\nThen to top it off, we shared some mascarpone cheesecake with chocolate cookie crust.

We made a same day reservation for 7people on a Sunday night and were seated immediately upon arrival.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. We started off with some cocktails while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. I tried the Strawberry Alarm Clock which was refreshing and not overly sweet and my hubs got the Old Cuban which was unique and tasty.\n\nFor starters we tried a few dishes: Hamachi Crudo, Hearth Grilled Octopus, Grilled Nantes Carrots, and Grilled Broccolini - The Hearth Grilled Octopus was my favorite by far - this was the most tender and juicy octopus I have ever had which was served over pickled potatoes, Spanish chorizo and topped with a savory aioli. Second favorite was the Hamachi Crudo - fresh yellowtail with simple and refreshing flavors.\n\nFor entrees we all ordered our own dishes but ended up sharing: Duck Bolognese, Half Chicken, Roasted Bone In Pork Chop, and Fire Roasted California Seabass. The favorite here was the Duck Bolognese - perfect al dente pasta with flavorful duck. The disappointment here was the seabass, which was dry and lacking flavor.\n\nOverall the food was good but very pricey - some dishes were great and others were just ok.

What?!\n\nI like that most dishes are dressed with vegan condiments and while I didn't confirm this but I did see a great selection of vegan and vegetarian friendly options.\n\nThe entrees were solid.

But I'll admit, I was more obsessed with the roasted veggies served with it. But that's just me! The pizzas were really good too.\n\nOverall this place is solid and definitely worth trying. They offer some excellent flavor combinations that you won't find at your average restaurant so that alone is reason enough! The staff was great and all really friendly.

Very millennial interior palette with reserved exposed brick to keep up with the Ice Blocks heritage. They have an excellent drinks menu even for daytime. I highly recommend the pomegranate mimosa. The Ruby Mule is inconsistent, one time I had it it was very sour, and another time it tasted watered-down. Their brunch menu is unreal. The Dutch Baby was too sweet for my taste. Interesting take on Charred Avocado Toast; my bread came out room temperature and hard... but they were accommodating in offering me a new, warm, and soft, slide of toast and butter. Other brunch items that I did not personally tried, but my companies did enjoy were: The MacMuffin, B+B Breakfast, and Soyrizo Bowl. Service is great overall (may be overdone). There is a formal hosting staff for seating, another hosting staff to get you menu and started with drinks, a serving staff to refill water, another serving staff to deal with table plating and payment.

We started with the roasted thin papas with the chutneys - one green and spicy and one dark red and a bit fruity. The wine list is good for spicy food, I was surprised by the selection.  Velvety low tannin Syrah from Paso Robles, Cotes du Rhone, Merlot from Washington state - these wines pair well with spicy and flavorful foods. We skipped the appetizers, and went straight to the Rarha Gosht lamb - ground lamb and lamb pieces in a spicy depthful sauce. Lemon rice with mint amazing, and the cauliflower in tomato sauce was also very good. A naan with mint completed the perfect amount for two, with deep flavors and the right amount of 'heat'.

The deliciously crusty pies are named after local destinations, like the Limantour and Bodega, as well as the Farallon, with its slivers of roasted garlic, mini pepperoni with crisped edges and a pile of mozzarella.\nGiven its cooking method, it\u2019s no surprise that Cafe Reyes is stacked high with wood, both against the walls and under the counter. The big, spacious, barn-like dining room is rustic, unfussy and perfect for groups.", "yelp_reviews": ["After an awful experience at Station House Cafe, we found this little gem of a pizza place. We arrived as they opened for dinner at 5pm and were seated promptly. There was a line out the door so that's always a good sign.\n\nWe ordered the Farralon and the Inverness pizza. One came with pepperoni, garlic and mushrooms and the other with fennel sausage and mushrooms. Both were cooked to perfection in their wood ovens. They were delicious and really hit the spot. We were served quickly, food was hot and fresh and we were out and back on the road in less than 30 minutes from arriving. This place will be our go-to stop for lunch or dinner anytime we visit Point Reyes Station. I highly recommend you give them a try. They had nice outdoor seating as well, and the staff was all very sweet.", "Caf\u00e9 Reyes has mastered a tried-and-true formula for dinner: local oysters on the half-shell, a crisp bountiful salad with pickled red onions and generous crumbles of Point Reyes blue cheese, and a well-curated selection of wood-fired pizzas. Add wine (or, in my boyfriend's case, Scrimshaw on tap) and you've got a room full of guests who are happy as clams. We love the industrial yet romantic setting here. Service is warm and efficient. My personal favorite pizza is the Farallon, which is generously scattered with pepperoni, mushrooms, and slivers of roasted garlic. The chewy golden crust is thin and blistered in all the right places. An artisanal creation!", "This was a drive by pop in and Quite a Surprise! It is up there on my pizza list for Best of Marin County. I think they are maybe edging out my favorite Bar Bocce in Sausalito but man, MILES away form each other...\nThis has that crust where you wonder is it the Water they use? or is it this Special Flour from Italy?\nSo thin and delicious & I don't like crust!\nOur Family shared the Large salad and was perfect for a Family of 4 and 2 pizzas. I think that Margherita was something special! You know when the Mozzarella is local and fresh and so is the basil and the Olive Oil drizzle and just every detail is thought out to be so spectacular in your mouth with each bite? and I'm not usually a Margherita person because to me it is so boring....so glad I tried a slice!\nThis is a NO FAIL, Awesome Restaurant that we will definitely return to again.\nWe had great service but it was 55 minutes to closing so only 2-3 other tables? Very pleasant experience and the outside looked beautiful too but only 1 trellis covered table for the Hot Sunny day that it was.", "I'm all about my local places, and this cafe certainly fits the bill. It's in an old barn, they've got a big ol' wood fire oven in the corner, and just about everything has been sourced from within the county, or at least Northern California. Yeah!\n\nThe pizzas are what you should come here for. They've got about six on the menu, all a little different from each other. You won't be disappointed. I like the Miwok. They have other foods too, usually in a Italian/California style. Oysters in season are highly recommended. Beers on tap are a decent selection, so quaff some suds with that 'za!\n\nDecor is open, a little spare. Stucco interior, with an awesome deck to sit on when the weather is nice. Sadly, this awesome deck has no shade whatsoever, so you'll want to bring shades and a hat if you wish to enjoy it. The West Marin sun can be sneaky and brutal.", "Cafe Reyes is a tucked away, busy gem in Point Reyes. Upon entering, this quaint dining room with rustic, wooden tables and tall ceilings with the tin roof creates a warm ambience. The space is a little dim, but it adds to the charm.\nWe ordered the cheesy bread and a pizza with sausage and spicy pepperoni and we were not disappointed. The cheesy bread came out first and it was delightful, served with a sprig of rosemary for personality.\nOur pizza was also wonderful. The sauce and the sausage had a nice sweet ting which balanced the savory bread and spicy pepperoni. The taste of the crust was delicious, I only wished it was a little more crisp on the bottom.\nOver all, wonderful experience with a tasty lunch!", "Liked everything about this restaurant: the decor, the service, the generous portions and especially the satisfying food.  Great organic green salad and wood oven pizzas. While I didn't try any, others in our group said oysters were on point.  Don't make the mistake I did, make sure to save room for some apple pie!", "Cute pizza joint with friendly staff! The house salad is super delicious perfectly prepared with crisp fresh romaine & mixed greens, lightly tossed in a dressing that didn't feel too rich and given a nice amount for two people. Their house wines are good quality and the pies are a must have. The pizza is thin crust and perhaps could use a bit more sauce but over all taste great. The biggest downer is this place is pricey! But then again I think that's just California as I have noticed everything is more expensive than Portland prices.", "Great place to enjoy locally sourced ingredients, especially the oysters. The pizza is fired up in a nice hot wood fueled oven, it has a fantastic chewy texture and blistery crust.

The day we went we had the Beet and Citrus Salad, Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin, Lobster Thermidor (supplement), a cheese course, and a Baked Alaska for dessert.

The staff was kind and attentive, though the courses arrived ever so slightly too far apart.  Perhaps it was because of a year plus of anticipation, but while each course was certainly very tasty, the food wasn't revolutionary.

The Yu Chou was a saut\u00e9ed Chinese broccoli with tofu in a very tasty sauce with a delicate sauce. I loved them both.\n\nFinished with the Roti & Kaya with the vegetarian sauce. That was great.

The dipping sauce was creamy and sweet which made it an excellent dessert.", "First dinner during my DC trip to see the Cherry Blossoms. All I can say is this place is BOMB! My boyfriend and I ordered 2 mains + all their desserts and everything was made so meticulously and authentic to the flavors of Malaysia. I ordered the curry noodles which are the best I have had on the east coast and my bf ordered the beef curry which was so so delicious.\n\nFor dessert we ordered both the roti and the sago plus a milk tea they pull. The roti was divine, crispy, sweet and came with a creamy sauce that made it one of the best desserts I have ever had. The sago was delicious as well and the combination of sweet and a little bit of salt made the dessert out of this world. Additionally, the milk tea here is so florally and delicious and has the right amount of sweetness.\n\nLove love love this place and would come back in a heartbeat.

The night was maybe in the low 70Fs, yet all heaters were on at full blast and big drawback to anyone who runs warm, like my husband. The patio also had low lighting to read the menus or see your food, but might have been intentional for the experience. The appetizer chosen was an assortment of cheeses and jam. Accompanied with these were various breads to sample. It was nothing special, but did get the appetite going. On to the entrees, we selected The 28 Day Aged New York Strip which was delicious. Ordered medium, the quality of the steak showcased Mar'sel fame as their must try dining establishment. Their best item on the menu is Chocolate Dulcey Pot De Cr\u00e8me. This dessert is so decadent and rich. So good, we ordered one to the room each night of our stay as our dessert cap. Overall, Mar'sel had the best service in the entire resort and the price to food ratio was deserving.", "Mar'sel is one of the restaurants within the Terranea Resort complex that sits on a mini bluff overlooking the coastline and ocean.\n\nInside, the restaurant has great space however, I think the stripe upholstered furniture needed updating to lightened the look. Having some classic dark wood pieces is ok, but the interior decorator went overboard with that fabric, almost tacky. They should take note of Spago's new decor.\nMy eye's refuge was the outside ocean view which will soon disappear after night and darkness instills.\n\nWhen staying at Terranea, Mar'sel seemed like one of the best restaurants, that is on the quiet side. The other restaurants had lots of loud children and/or larger groups.\n\nThe menu had a good selection, but I wanted to keep the ocean theme going so ordered the following: yellowtail, grilled veggie salad for starters. Main included Scallops, Chilean Sea Bass and the Branzino. I must say, every dish was presented lovely, fresh, and tasted distinctly divine. Seemed like a lot, but sans bread, carbs and lots of unnecessary side dishes, a meandering dinner with accompanying wines, killer ocean views was a near perfect Valentines. Service from the host, waiter and servers were excellent. Will definitely return and recommend.", "I have been to Terranea several times for events where down time included taking in some of the local services.

Add these to the view and a couple of good drinks and my overall experience was outstanding.\n\nTo make it even nicer the place still manages a casual vibe for a high end experience.

The view this evening was particularly beautiful, as there was a full moon and the weather was perfect. Our server was very polite and knowledgeable about the menu.\n\nHowever, for the expectations and price, we were severely underwhelmed by the quality and taste of our dishes. We ordered the scallops for an appetizer (by far the best item we ordered, and would definitely have them again). For our main dish, we ordered the sunchokes, Maine lobster and braised short ribs. The lobster dish was an eclectic array of flavors, which may have been better had the lobster not been terribly over cooked and very bland. While the presentation of the dish was nice, there were too many competing flavors. The short ribs had a decent braise, but were very dry and over cooked. For 50$ an entr\u00e9e we were let down by the quality of the cooking, and overall lack of flavor.\n\nOverall, the food is what brought this experience from a higher rating to a three star. Spending 100$ a person for dinner should not lead you to an underwhelming and poorly cooked plate.\n\nWe will definitely be exploring other options at Terranea for dinner after this experience.", "This is the only restaurant where you'll find the best server and the best bartender in the same place.

We were looking for a great omakase experience that wouldn't break the bank and after reading the good yelp reviews, decided to check it out. Definitely make a reservation because this place is really tiny (only about 12 seats at the sushi bar!). I really loved that you had a front row seat to the action and had a very personalized experience throughout the meal.\n\nSpecial shoutout to our sushi chef Feri who was absolutely amazing. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating to any special requests. We opted for the 16 piece omakase option which could be served over the span of 1.5 hours. The fish was incredibly fresh and the chef explains every piece and every addition that he is adding to your sushi. They were very creative, with a huge variety of pieces that kept the meal interesting and engaging.\n\nPro tip: they include the salary of the sushi chef in the price of the bill, so additional tip is not required. However, if you enjoyed your dish it's recommended to bring CASH to tip your sushi chef after your meal. We didn't know this or we would have brought more cash just for this!\n\nOverall, highly recommend for a wonderful, immersive omakase experience on the UWS. Thank you Chef Feri!", "Sushi Kaito is now my favorite sushi place in NYC.  It's the freshest, melt in your mouth sushi at the best price point for quality. I've been on a mission lately to find the best high quality for price mix and this is it.  \n\nYou get there 15 min before your reservation (this is a Japanese thing... you want to make sure they seat and serve everyone at the same time like you would play an orchestrated symphony), get seated at the sushi bar... and then the chef serves the most freshest choice of the day. Fish selection probably changes everyday, but we had: sea bream, different types of mackerel, tuna, shrimp, scallop, hokkaido uni, golden eye, otoro, eel, spicy tuna hand roll.... among others. I seriously wanted to melt into a piece of the furniture just so I can experience this sushi everyday. Your meal is finished with their signature tomago, which is a spongy egg like cake made with shrimp and fish paste, along side mountain yam. Sooooo good! ^^* ::does a little dance::\n\nStaff is friendly, will be back soon for sure!", "The fish at Sushi Kaito was certainly fresh. There is no doubt about that. However, as far as omakase goes, the selection offered here was pretty vanilla. There wasn't really any one piece that blew me out of the water. A meal at Sushi Kaito is curt. You eat your 12 or 16 courses and you go. Whereas other omakase places choose to indulge you in a show, Sushi Kaito is all business.\nPerhaps I've seen all there is to see about omakase at this price point. I'm wondering if it might be time to graduate to some of the pricier (and maybe flashier?) options in the area. Needless to say, Sushi Kaito satisfies the omakase craving but didn't exactly wow. We had all the usual suspects--mackerel, snapper, salmon, tuna, fatty tuna, ebi, uni, scallop, tamago. The preparation for all was minimal, no more than a light brush of sauce or a sprinkle of salt for flavoring. If all you're looking for is a quick hit of raw fish, Sushi Kaito is the way to go. Otherwise, I'd wager there are other places within arm's reach that'd be a better place to take a date! Note: the place is very small. A reservation is highly recommended.", "I just finished an exquisite omakase at Sushi Kaito which was the best sushi I've ever eaten between Tokyo and New York City. It deserves every one of the 5 stars! The selection of fish was not the usual fare of tuna, yellow tail, salmon, shrimp, etc. The chef, Jorge, had selected fish from Japan which are delicacies even there. The flavors were delicate; the textures were sublime; and preparation was flawless. The rice was prepared with special red vinegar which gave it a subtle taste rather than the usual sweet vinegar taste. Japan-trained, Jorge was articulate and knowledgeable about the different kinds of fish being served. Although I've eaten sushi since childhood, I learned a lot in the 90 minutes we spent at Sushi Kaito. I wholeheartedly recommend the omakase. We had the 12-piece course ($75), which came with 2 pre-courses and miso soup. Service was discreet, courteous and attentive. The atmosphere was peaceful and serene. It was a beautiful experience. What a fantastic addition to the neighborhood!", "The omakase experience at sushi kaito definitely reminded me of the omakase meals I had in Japan. My friend scored a 7pm Sunday seating and the experience from start to finish was amazing. We opted for the 12 piece omakase meal for $75. They also offer a 16 piece omakase meal for $100 if you're feeling hungry for it. Both seatings are 1.5hrs and start exactly on time so don't be late. the master chef was an adorable old man who was very knowledgeable and friendly. Every piece he made was delicious, fresh, and flavorful. It just melts in your mouth and no fishy taste at all! my party was full at the end of the omakase but we opted to order a la carte just to see what else he had. This place is worth a try and the price includes tip and tax.", "To use the word special is almost an understatement.

The medium fatty tuna needs nothing more than a kiss of soy sauce. A 12-course \"omakase\" might also include giant clam, uni, sea eel, fluke, smelt roe, and for dessert, tamago. The kanto soba is excellent too, with a rich soy-bonito broth brimming with scallions, seaweed and a fish cake.", "yelp_reviews": ["This 5 star review is really for one dish - the salmon, ikura (fish roe), and avocado donburi.  The salmon was marbled with healthy fat and lightly seared on the skin side.  Combined with the rich yet healthy avocado fat and topped with a hint of fresh sea with the ikura, this was a-melt-in-your-mouth-fatty-goodness that just has to be sampled over and over again.  Literally one of my favorite dishes ever!  It also came with rice, a springy seaweed salad, and radish.\n\nWe also got the tempura here but I'd rate that 2 stars...Ajisai in Hell's Kitchen has really flaky tempura that I'm partial to.  I thought the tempura here was too thickly coated.\n\nWe also got the Miyabi set which had a roll, nigiri, and sashimi.  I'd give this a 4 - the sushi had a nice solid consistency and was tender.  There is just a bit of wasabi swabbed between the rice and fish in the nigiri.\n\nWe also had the green tea crepe cake for dessert.  I'd say the portion of green tea to crepe was a little overwhelming.  While the ice cream helped bring the crepes more to the forefront, I would have still appreciated a better balance between the green tea and crepe.\n\nThe place is a decent size but fills up quickly!  Make sure you have a reservation!", "Good quality food that is very reasonably priced - if you can get a table.  \n\nSeems to be extremely popular even Sunday night. Quite noisy inside, as there are no real partitions, and to be honest I would have liked to not have had to hear random strangers' dating adventures throughout our meal.  I guess I can see why they spoke so loudly because I could barely hear myself talk over the noise.\n\nBut the food is consistently good across all dishes we ordered.  In particular I was surprised by freshness of the sashimi.  The unagi (eel over rice) is also a great deal as they actually put two layers of eel over rice, and it also tasted better than average.\n\nThe decor is not quite hole in the wall but you get the sense they keep prices low perhaps by forgoing remodeling.  Menu has a large selection.", "A tad inconsistent, but a decent avenue to get more experience with sushi and the omakase format.\n\nThe $45 omakase with 15 courses includes typical items like yellowtail, red snapper, salmon and fatty tuna. There were a few others I hadn't had before, like marinated horse mackerel and rishiri(?). What is of particular note is the shrimp course: raw shrimp nigiri with its head lightly fried in tempura! It is hands down their most confident course: the shrimp is springy and very fresh, while the salt on the head is excellently balanced.\n\nWhat needs some work here is the rice temperature -- the rolls that they serve with rice straight from the cooker are great, but in the rush to service all customers many of the chefs would keep a plastic tray of rice on the counter.", "When I first looked at the Sushi Yasaka menu, I was struck at the simplicity of their offerings.  Lately, I'm used to seeing a panoply of Mad-Libs inspired rolls.  You pick the city/movie character/animal and stick the word roll on it.  Then you're bound to encounter rolls that have much more than just the fish   But, this menu was very straightforward.   At Sushi Yasaka, they put their time and effort into the fish and the form and it really shows.\n\nWe started with a simple steamed Gyoza appetizer.  It was just that.  There were no extraneous elements to pull focus.  Just a row of steamed dumplings and a small dipping sauce.  \n\nIt didn't hurt that they offer Kinsen plum wine, which is a favorite between us.  \n\nFor dinner, we had a few rolls each.  Again, there was nothing too fancy about this meal and that's what made it really good.  Negi Yellowtail, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, Negi Toro, Eel Avocado and Pumpkin Tempura were for dinner.  Everything was delicious and notably fresh.  \n\nThe folks at Sushi Yasaka should be proud and I hope they keep this up.   We've been looking for an affordable, clean and new sushi haunt.  I'm optimistic about this place!", "Married into a Japanese family and for the past couple of years, I've learned how to distinguish the authentic Japanese flavors from the Chinese/Korean-owned imitations. (Not only is the sushi incredible, but surprisingly, the hot food is just as impressive!)\n\n1) The Agedashi tofu (tempura tofu in a lightly sweetened broth) was absolutely delicious, while not being salty or soggy. Perfectly made.\n\n2) Gyoza dumplings were nicely crisp all around and tasted as though someone freshly handmade them in the back.\n\n3) The Kanto Soba noodle soup (buckwheat noodles) was light and refreshing, even on a hot day. Again, perfect blend of flavors and not salty as most of these imitation places are.\n\n4)Their wasabi is awesome and freshly made on-site! Not that powdered/jarred stuff.\n\nSo glad we found this gem- thanks to all the Yelpers who recommended it!", "Incredibly fresh and well-prepared sushi! Every piece of seafood I've had here has been of the utmost quality. The Omakase (chef's special sushi selection) can't be beat. The toro tuna particularly blew me away, and I was pleasantly surprised by the giant clam and blowfish. Also, the grilled fish is buttery smooth and delectable-- just a hint of balanced sweetness. Don't leave without tasting one of the Lady M crepe cakes on the dessert menu!\n\nThough the restaurant is small, I enjoyed the ambiance. A divider down the middle makes it feel cozier and more private. Each utensil and room decor is elegantly chosen with an expert eye. Service was efficient and polite. To top it all off, I'd say this place is very nicely priced for the high quality of the experience and excellent location.", "This is arguably the best sushi in the city.

There are staple dishes with rotating side items. I've had the sushi bowl, croquettes, and tonkatsu - all of which are phenomenal. All of the sets are served on beautiful wooden trays and each piece of ceramic is locally made. Every time I eat at Rintaro, I deeply admire the craft placed into every dish. The side dishes all exude the Japanese philosophy of showcasing natural ingredients. To eat at Rintaro is a humbling experience. Whenever it was a Friday afternoon and my colleagues would smile wistfully, we would all be sending each other the same mental message: Rintaro.\n\nIt's truly an honor to dine at Rintaro.", "I've come to Izakaya Rintaro a couple times now and I've loved it every time. I absolutely LOVE the skewers. The standards are some of my favorites. The oyster from the deluxe menu is also very delicious, though it's a bit on the sweeter side. I think I've only tried the king trumpet from the vegetable section and it's definitely worth trying.\n\nSome of the other items I've tried are:\nShungiku Kamo Sarada - The duck is delicious with the chrysanthemum greens\nTeba No Karaage - I'm a sucker for good karaage and this karaage is pretty awesome\nChiizu Tori Katsu - The chicken katsu is so yum especially since it has cheese in it :D\nNatto Don - This was a great dish to end on. It's a little soupy with some meat and tofu and it was definitely a favorite amongst the table\n\nIzakaya Rintaro is one of my favorite restaurants in the city now. The staff is very nice and knowledgeable which is really helpful if you aren't too sure what to order. Definitely make a reservation soon if you've never been.", "Unique intimate Japanese restaurant with nice outdoor eating space - nothing fancy but high quality food and attentive service - we particularly loved the soft tofu dish, the miso cod sunomono, as well as the variety of skewers (trumpet mushrooms, okra, duck as well as the more classic chicken/meatballs."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/rintaro-san-francisco-4?hrid=NbVCmGQTi0QVRC5UZF0uDg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rintaro-san-francisco-4?hrid=WZwZFsSmwMfxMKs2ZvZ3gA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rintaro-san-francisco-4?hrid=HK2JssbajlK2tg_Y8m-_Ug&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rintaro-san-francisco-4?hrid=vHwt5aDq278MI8ebf9ujUA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rintaro-san-francisco-4?hrid=uOXVP6tiHGu3htU-PyQfWw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/rintaro-san-francisco-4?hrid=PhddTRfkrUuAWy_44AHspQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "GT Fish &amp; Oyster", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/gt-fish-and-oyster-chicago/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/gt-fish-oyster", "michelin_pov": "Quaint seaside shacks have nothing on this nautical-chic spot.

The menu is comprised of small plates that are meant for sharing. I've tried most of the dishes and don't have anything but nice things to say. No complaints here!\n\nThe dishes are seafood-centric, but there are a couple dishes for non-fish eaters and a couple for vegetarians. They are also happy to make substitutions on the dishes.\n\nI would recommend the oysters (if that is your thing), fish tacos, eggplant (vegetarian), po boy sliders with kimchi, and the lobster roll. The lobster roll is served with plenty of fried onions for crunch and they are generous with the lobster meat. The key to a killer lobster roll is the toasted soft roll and GT does a perfect buttery grill on the bun.\n\nThey have a salted caramel tart that is not to be missed. I recommend ordering one less menu item than you think you need and saving room (or calories) for dessert because it is worth it!\n\nThe space is beautifully decorated with a chic nautical theme and the service is spot on- the servers always often great suggestions. The bathroom also has a gold sink that I am obsessed with. Points for style!", "GT, you continue to impress me!\n\nReturned with reservations for dinner on a Tuesday night. Specifically requested the main dining area vs. the smaller seating area by the boomerang table we sat by last time. There is a noticeable difference between the two. The main dining room is more \"restaurant\" with intimate side table seating and large family style communal tables (seemed like older patrons preferred this), whereas the boomerang section is more hip and happening (young and loud).\n\nService was again outstanding with good plate pacing. Had the lobster mac and cheese this time around and it knocked my socks off. BBQ Eel was a winner as well. The PEI mussels came with delicious bread to sop up the tasty sauce. The other new dish we tried was the haddock dip with taro chips which was okay but I would not get again amongst the shining stars of other options.\n\nDo not leave this place without trying: the sunfish ceviche, the lobster roll, and the lobster mac & cheese.", "Gem!!!! Me and my husband come out to Chicago 4 times a year and we never miss going to this place.. This restaurants design is  just absolutely beautiful.. The Thought out process of the entrance and everything with in the set up is just charming! We walked over for brunch this time and deff enjoyed ourselves... We started with some fresh oysters then moved on to the reason why we come here... deep fried oyster sliders so yummy! We also split the truffle burger and lobster roll! But whatever you do save room for desert. It's one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever had...", "Came to GT to celebrate and was not disappointed! I have a food allergy and the bartender (we sat at the bar) was very gracious and seemed really knowledgeable about things I could or could not eat. The tuna poke was amazing, as were the raw oysters (naturally. ) Try them with the mignonette or the GT burn hot sauce!  I had the grilled Penn Cove oysters, so good! My husband loved his po'boy and the swordfish was fantastic. Thanks to my allergy I thought dessert would be out of the question, but our outstanding bartender/server recommended accommodations for the apple dessert (cinnamon ice cream with apple sorbet, usually comes with date cake and a streusel topping) so that I could enjoy it too.  If you're dining at the bar, make sure you sit in Kayla's section, she was so helpful and knew her stuff!", "Definitely lived up to its name with the dozen of fresh and tasty oysters we had.  Our biggest gripe would have to be choosing which oyster to try as they were not cheap!\n\nWe dined with our 5-year old daughter and unless your kid is an adventurous diner, there is virtually nothing on the menu for them.  We also ordered the lobster roll which was good but would've been better if the lobster were warm instead of cold like a salad.  The stuffed squash flower was amazing but the mussels were not the best.  Key lime for dessert was a unique concept served in a mason jar but I really needed the graham cracker pie crust to balance the tartness.  \n\nOverall a good place but too pricey. Service was good but food took long to get to our table.", "Beautiful place! I've been here a couple of times in the last few weeks and I definitely have a few favorites. I love the baja shrimp bruschetta . This is such a perfect bite of shrimp with avocado that I could eat an entire plate of it. The avocado creme is insane! The oyster sliders are perfect. I really loved the lobster roll - the onions on the side thrown into the roll made it really flavorful. I also couldn't get enough of the gnocchi or the fish tacos.\n\nThe lobster bisque and clam chowder were both good. Beware the heat of the lobster bisque underneath that delicious pastry that shelters it. Hot!! Maybe a little too hot as the lobster keeps cooking a bit longer than it should. I also had some lobster pasta dish tonight that I had high hopes for that was only ok. The only thing I've had that I disliked was the oyster caesar salad. The lettuce was so limp...it just wasn't good.\n\nService is excellent. I am excited to try some of dishes that are not of the sea. The chicken and the short rib really do sound fantastic. This place fills up fast!", "Tried for brunch. The bright, glass walled dining room is a good venue for brunch.\n\nDuck chilaquiles were a tasty twist on this Mexican standard. The tortilla strips were appropriately al dente rather than being soggy or too crisp. A perfectly cooked sunny side up egg added some creaminess.\n\nBagles and lox was very good. Nice, smoky lox, and a healthy layer of chived cream cheese.

Yes, you'll find pad thai, lard nar, and panang curry here. You'll also find several different types of larb, pad hed poa (my personal fave), and more than one type of insect, to name just a few.

They were a little bit more starchy than most sausages but were full of spice. Despite their small size, these sausages were quite a tasty package.\n\nI also remember loving the fish cake. It's almost in the form of a mini pancake. There was a LOT of ginger.\n\nThe kow soy was the best thing I ate here. It was creamy, spicy, sweet, and savory all at once.

The fish was cooked so that it was a little crispy, and it was topped with a spicy, slightly sweet sauce as well as a generous serving of string beans.\n\nKow soy: Super fragrant coconut flavors in the curry as well as a generous portion of noodles.\n\nSticky rice with taro: True to its namesake, this was delicious. It was basically warm sticky rice infused with pieces of taro, but it was so good I would gladly inhale another two orders of this.\n\nGood prices, decent food, and a nice change from the traditional Thai dishes that you normally see.", "I love Thai food, therefore I eat a lot of it! No other place compares to Sticky Rice in terms of quality and price.

I thought  \"maybe I just ordered something good this time\" or \"maybe the chef cooking today is good compared to the one that usually cooks\" etc. Nope.

The spaghetti was not as heavy as I expected nor flavorful and the dishes are on the smaller side but I was satisfied! The crispy rice cake lasagna is a must try though because it was so good and very savory but yes it is heavy. The tuna tartare is small with 5 pieces of seaweed but very refreshing as a appetizer. The yakult soft serve was fantastic. Tastes light and milky with tiny bits of chicken skin that you can barely taste because it was a hint of savory with the sweet yakult. I was surprised that it paired well but to be honest it didn't even need the chicken skin because the yakult soft serve was so good already. The east side haiku was a light and very sweet drink that is purple in color while the wagashi was stronger in alcohol but had a nice matcha touch to it.", "Innovative and playful dishes that are full of nuance and complexity - 10/10 would recommend! Nearly everything I got was executed beautifully, save for the roe roe roe pasta which would've been impossible to screw up but was unfortunately underseasoned and overly al dente.\n\nI liked the spicy tuna appetizer - fresh and a textural delight that is interactive with the crisp seaweed. The figs and cheese was a classically tasty combination that was amped up with the addition of a shiso leaf. The eggplant katsu was meaty and had the heft of an actual pork chop. My favorite dish was the vegan miso pasta; it was full of umami flavor.\n\nThe desserts here are also a must-get. Definitely try the yakult soft-serve with berry compote and a chicken skin streusel, the textural contrasts are bomb. I also enjoyed the seasonal squash dessert with mochi and miso caramel. Kimika does savory-sweet flavors very well.\n\nI also enjoyed their cocktails - there was a whiskey-based one and a gin-based one that I really liked.

Our server told us that two people typically order 4-6 dishes, but we were completely stuffed after 3.5. The winner was the corn and edamame risotto, followed by the squash pizette. The pizette was said to have fennel pollen, chamomile, shiso-sunflower pesto, and chili oil. None of these flavors were evident except for the chili oil, and it was served room temperature. We did not really enjoy the duck fat potatoes or the eggplant katsu as they were too rich. Honestly, it is really expensive, and for these prices, I would want everything to be amazing.", "Was extremely excited after checking out the menu and looking at the pictures.

On paper the description of the food sounded so intriguing, but it literally tasted like my 15 year old brother cooked it after reading the menu. All the food was disappointing and the steam rice was just straight up bad. We left hungry and ended up going a block over to get pasta and pizza. Don't waste your time and money.", "Sad to say this place is overly hyped, with no substance whatsoever. Drinks and service were ok, but for a $200 dinner that was hardly edible, it's just not acceptable in a place like NYC. Melone spritz was disappointing kind of bland, not much melon flavor. Pizzettes were ok but oddly cold and greasy. Burrata pizzette was not fresh, both the burrata and tomatoes taste sour like spoiled milk. Roe roe pasta was so fishy just from the smell. I could barely take 2 bites without feeling nauseated from the rotten fish taste. The cavatelli with pork ragu sounds like solid bet, right? Wrong. It ended up being even worse than the roe roe spaghetti, there was a very strange foul gamey smell more like goat, but when you're chewing it, there's a very peculiar, sharp salty and sour acidic after taste, again much like rotten dairy or for those familiar, old soybean paste (doubanjiang). Like many other reviews mention, we contemplated finding the nearest $1 pizza or fast food spot after. Unfortunately, I couldn't not even handle the thought of any food when I was done, for fear of getting sick.", "You definitely need a reservation to get into this place. The staff were really nice and let us wait in the lobby of the building while we waited for our reservation. The ambiance is nice and more upscale than I expected.

Everyone was knowledgeable about the menu and described to us every part of it when it was brought out.\n\nAs for the food, we got the tuna tartare (26$), uni pizza (32$), and duck duck crab (46$). Our waiter said that everything is family style, so we just shared. The tuna tartare had a bunch of toppings around it which we were instructed to mix in. It was served with a few seaweed sheets too. I thought it was great, though I think by its size it could only be shared between 2 people. The uni pizza was also delicious - the pizza was more like a scallion pancake with uni butter and there was charred uni on the side. The crab was maybe half or one soft shell crab with a salad on the side. It was tasty but I think for the price I would skip.\n\nOverall, thought it was a good experience and food but definitely on the pricier side.", "Very friendly and attentive service by all three people who attended to us.

Amazing wines, nice rotating menu that we've never been disappointed by.

The place is completely packed and there is no room to wait for a table that is not yet ready.  The waitstaff made blunders that left me feeling embarrassed and awkward.  They sat us down at a table that was not yet cleared from the last group.  I asked a question twice while ordering which was ignored.  At that point I just wanted the experience with the waitstaff over.  The food was above average but the place just gave off this unwelcome feel.  I'll gladly pay double for lower quality food if the place has a welcome vibe and halfway professional waitstaff.  AWKWARD overall.  Sad as I was really looking forward to eating here.", "I was looking for a place to get some friends together for my partner's 40th birthday, and this popped up in Yelp. I didn't know anything about it, but they let me make a reservation for a large party and said we could bring in an outside cake. WOW. I could not be happier with my choice! The food was AMAZING, the staff was super attentive, they were able to do a simple dish for the one child in our group, the menu is annotated for people with allergies and the kitchen was very good about accommodating my Celiac's (no gluten reaction!), AND they put the cake back in one of their refrigerators and brought it out with the candles lit! I was so nervous about trying a new place, but our whole experience was marvelous! We are definitely going back!", "I live several blocks from Baran's and despite the many other food options around i find myself coming back here time and again.

The only downside is that you need to go with someone who speaks Mandarin or Taiwanese to get the good stuff. Most of the stuff on the menu that's translated into English isn't very good. Their hot pot is out of this world.. so good even though you end up paying for it the next day. Go with a big group of people on a chilly day and ask for the hot pot.

We wanted smaller, sweet oysters but unfortunately they ran out of what they had.  We went with a dozen of their alternate recommendation and it was good, their cocktail and vinegar sauces were just right to go with the brine of the oysters.\n\nWe also got the pork belly -- DIVINE -- I have yet to meet a pork product I didn't adore.  This was well executed, not dry at all, just a little crisp with good texture.  Then we got the short ribs special with mac 'n cheese and Old Bay french fries to share.  Short ribs were falling apart, tender, juicy, meaty, YUM.  Mac 'n cheese was definitely among my top faves, baked with a good crust.  Seasoned fries were great, who doesn't love Old Bay??

The ambiance is quaint with a cute nautical theme. The menu isn't very large but they have some solid seafood staples and great lunch options. I got a Mahi Mahi filet with an Asian flare and a side salad. Everything was tasty! The Mahi Mahi was fresh and seasoned perfectly. Added bonus - there were freshly diced red chili peppers over top of the fish. Yum! The side salad was pretty basic but in the way you want a side salad to be - dark leafy greens with tomatoes and shredded carrot. But the champagne vinaigrette - now that made the salad! It had just enough tartness and an amazing flavor. I wish they sold it by the bottle! I would totally buy it and use it on my salads. The lobster roll and crab cakes are next on my list. Overall, this place is a seafood lovers choice. Check it out at one of the 3 locations.", "I really love Hank's Oyster Bar.  I was tight on funds so couldn't sample nearly everything that I wanted to this past Saturday Evening.  There was a long wait for tables, but being alone, I opted for a seat at the raw bar with no wait.  I ordered a sampling of the 6 different raw oysters that were featured that night at $2.00 each and the peel and eat shrimp for $12.00.  All was fresh and delicious and a real treat for me.   I also ordered a specialty drink that was good, but pricey.  I loved everything, but on a limited budget I was left wanting so much more.  I think I would do a lot better at Hank's during happy hour when the Oyster's are half price and drinks only $4.00.  \n\nThe last time I was there I did partake in a full meal with all the trimmings and appetizers and it was divine, but ran about $140 for two people with alcoholic beverages.  \n\nFor me, Hank's would get five stars if it reduced it's prices a bit.  Although the quality is great, I think it is still a bit too pricey to be considered a top value for your hard earned dollar.", "We came here for dinner, it was getting past our usual meal time, and we were really hungry.  Hank's doesn't take reservations, but I'd read you can call 30 minutes in advance to get on the waiting list.  I'd done this, and we had a 30 minute walk from the museum where we'd been.  When we arrived we were seated in the bar and told it may be up to 30 more minutes, but before we could even order drinks a table was ready for us.  We had some nice cocktails and I had a half dozen oysters (yum).  Main courses for us included soft-shell crab (I'd never had it before), clam chowder, and other non-seafood dishes.  The crab was pretty good, but not maybe something I'd order on a regular basis.  The restaurant itself is nice inside--  A series of fairly small rooms, bustling, and a bit crowded and loud.  When we left there was still a line waiting to be seated.  There is an outdoor seating area, but it was a bit chilly the night we were there.", "Amazing! Love all of their food. They are a bit on the pricier side so I can't go there too frequently but it's always worth the money when I do.\n\nFavorite things - Hog Island BBQ Oysters, Unlimited Mimosa/Bloody Mary Sundays, fried oysters, oysters on the half shell, homemade sodas, stuffed french toast, seafood frittata, mac n cheese, french fries.\n\nMy friend doesn't typically eat seafood but she really loves this place. She doesn't like oysters any other way but she raves about the Hog Island BBQ Oysters. She also loves their stuffed french toast and she's generally picky about french toast.\n\nI've only eaten there for dinner once and can't really recall what I got.

I wish the pot stickers had its own sauce but thankfully there was soy sauce on the table. We had the banana cream pie and the chocolate cream pie. My friends loved the banana cream pie.

I did like this dish, though I forgot to switch the white rice for brown rice and the sauce was a bit strong, overpowering the taste of the sablefish. I tried the bulgogi as well and it was okay. I think if coming back, I'll order other dishes because for the price, I wanted to love the dishes.\nOne sure thing was that service throughout dinner was stellar.", "We got here around 9:30pm on a Friday. It looked crowded on the inside when we passed by, but luckily the wait was only 15 minutes for a table. We were seated outside.\n\nWhile I usually like outdoor dining, I wished they had turned on their lights outside so that diners could actually see their food. (However, I walked by the restaurant the other day and noticed they had the outside lights on, so maybe they figured it out.)\n\nSo the food photos aren't great because of the lack of lighting, but it was definitely delicious.\n\nThe rice cake fundido was cheesy and the perfect size. The tuna, sea urchin, and cod roe cold bibimbap was pretty good too - lots of toppings. But my favorite was the boneless beef short rib ssam. Love wrapping it in lettuce wraps with rice. They also brought us a bunch of banchan.\n\nI don't remember the name of the cocktail I got. The waiter recommended it and I believe it had strawberries in it. It was not my favorite because I prefer drinks on the sweet side, but I think it was just personal preference.\n\nA big plus: our waiter was nice and extremely attentive. All in all, an amazing dining experience and I'd definitely come back.", "Not only is the food amazing, but the service is incredible. I mentioned to our waiter that I love perilla leaves (which are hard to find even in Korean restaurants in New York) and he brought me a basket of them! The service team is a well orchestrated machine and it's kind of amazing to watch. I've tried about 6 things on the menu and everything delivers, and the drinks are good too. Plus they have a number of excellent dining options - indoors, outdoors, including heat. If you go on a Saturday night, 5th Ave is closed to traffic for open streets and you can hear the bands over at the Commissioner/High Dive. I'll be back!", "The food at Haenyeo is amazing! A must if you are a fan of seafood and fish. Had zero problems with the food and service. I recommend making a reservation to secure a table.\n\nHighlights:\n- grilled oysters: buttery, briney, and tasty.\n- spicy rice cakes: the chorizo adds an extra savoury taste to the dish, keeping the dish spicy and savoury rather sweet.\n- spicy bouillabaisse: delicious stew with generous servings of shellfish. tastes fresh with natural flavours of the sea. definitely add the grilled ciabatta.\n- spicy cured cod roe bibimbap: tastes fresh and light. the perilla leaves add an earthiness to the sashimi and roe ingredients. one of my favourites.\n- sugar dusted beignets: so fluffy and tasty. they were a perfect end to the meal\n\nI highly recommend Haenyeo. The food is excellent and you will leave satiated and happy having eaten an awesome meal.", "After hearing about this new restaurant last winter. I decided to check it out although I live near KTown in Manhattan, but took a ride to a familiar fav nabe in Park Slope.  Haenyou is now my secret little GEM.  The food is absolutely delish.  We wanted to eat everything so decided to just do small plates.  We had the fundido/dduybuki, a spicy rice cake w/melted cheese and chorizo sprinkled on top!  The roasted oysters w/seaweed butter sauce, amazing plump oysters begging for more sauce to dip bread into, falling off the bone pork ribs in a wonderful traditional Korean paste, fried scallops with a lovely tie and mayo based tartar sauce and a lovely zucchini scallion pancake, light and airy.  I will visit once a month from here on in and order the lovely plates we saw everyone else having.  The ambience is hip/ cool Oark slope and child friendly. Christine, our server was just lovely.  All that food with 3 glasses of wine, a shot and another specialty drink only came to $123.", "Amazing Korean in the heart of Park Slope. This place is fantastic. While it's not super traditional the menu takes some liberties and delivers with their high quality ingredients and imaginative recipes. I think they're owned by the same folks as Do Hwa in the west village. I was initially sad when Le Pain left park slope but glad they took their place!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/haenyeo-brooklyn?hrid=ezRHJbbJgT6V3VKw5lLgGw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/haenyeo-brooklyn?hrid=ZDIyTbO0z_sqjXyzupqnGQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/haenyeo-brooklyn?hrid=k7yVB9JOufS9jPMnMRfEGw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/haenyeo-brooklyn?hrid=OlcMrMgkWlxWWsseNi7WRg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/haenyeo-brooklyn?hrid=jlytiYpSJQOSdSnUX18pVg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/haenyeo-brooklyn?hrid=PEwh_-WlRUSUHvA6mjXbdQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/haenyeo-brooklyn?hrid=GEFJjo8n1xSVv9HcFq6-MA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Ciccio", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/ciccio-new-york-11/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/ciccio399639", "michelin_pov": "Chef/owner Giacomo Romano defines this rustic little spot as an alimenteria\u2014a place where patrons can find ever-changing temptations day or night.

We ordered a side of green beans that were so good they didn't even taste like what we thought of green beans. They were perfectly browned with salt and garlic and shaved Parmesan.\n\nAnd the drinks are really unique and really tasty. Mine had vodka celery olive oil and black pepper among other flavors...

Excellent service. Last time I had service at this level was in NYC. The food is entirely delicious. We enjoyed an appetizer of mushrooms on ricotta which was super flavorful, and the Dolmades or stuffed grape leaves. The Dolmades were a little different than the usual lemony rice stuffed version. These had a beef cheek stuffing. Fabulous flavor. Our table enjoyed the Rib Eye, the Filet Mignon, the Branzino, and the Lamb Chops. I sampled them all. Cooked exactly to order for doneness. Really phenomenal seasoning and grill flavors both on the main dishes and the roasted potato and spinach sides. Completely nailed it. Their wine list is really enjoyable as well, lots of great bottle selections as well as by the glass. The ambiance is all about special occasion with it's warm lighting and fireplace. We were near the open kitchen and enjoyed watching the ballet of service.\nNot by any fault of the restaurant, the bar, that is open to the main dining area, is a mecca for the Housewives of Los Gatos.

I've never had that before and it was quite the treat.\n\nFor my entree, I opted for my favorite pasta: pappardelle with lamb ragu.  Unfortunately, it was way too saturated with wine and other ingredients that took away from its usual taste and it made it fall on the bitter side.\n\nOverall, this is a nice restaurant with a great selection of food and an overabundant amount of wine.  The steak menu, while pricey, looked quite interesting.

Friend, coming down from So. SF.  Her sister, the owner's good friend, suggested the place.  Absolutely no regrets.  In fact, quite delighted and very much orgasmic, if I must say so!\n\nWe started with the Pikilia, an appetizer medley consisting of ovenbaked spanakotiropita, pan- seared scallops, braised beef short-rib dolmathes and pan seared lamb meatballs.  We also had the mesquite-grilled octopus, which was extremely tender in its simple preparation.  Next, we had the layered casserole of tender-braised ground lamb and the slow-braised Sonoma lamb shanks.  Please refer to their menu for more details.

Then because it was cold (I'm a California native and was on vacation - I'm not used to New York snowy weather) I decided on the french onion soup.

It was odd to think my first meal in NYC would be fried chicken with mashed potatoes, gravy, and collard greens but this kitchen can bring the fire. I was also very pleased with the big windows and street corner location which made the dining experience that much more of an experience. And did I mention bone marrow with fresh baked bacon bread? Even a simple endive salad managed to blow me away which makes me happy because I love a restaurant that puts as much passion into a light salad as their entrees.  You can't escape the incredible scent coming from downstairs where they bake their own bread, so we went down after dinner to see what was up. We were treated to an olfactory sensation like no other, and gladly accepted a taste of some fresh buns they just put out. Blue Ribbon is a great combination of Southern hospitality and New York City innovation.", "Let me just start off by saying James & Victor = The Dream Team.\n\nYou may be wondering, what does that even mean?

Turns out we found the right place. They had West coast  and East coast oysters, so obviously we tried both. They were amazing. Victor was so knowledgeable about oysters and shucking them the correct way.\n\nWe liked this place so much that we came here twice, so I highly recommend this place for oysters and food. We got the bone marrow (which was absolutely divine) and we also got the fried oysters which were prepared with a mild horseradish spinach cream sauce.

The tropical verrine\u2014presenting a modern version of the traditional dessert halo halo\u2014has mouthwatering layers of coconut panna cotta, tropical fruit and passion fruit gel\u00e9e.\nThe best way to appreciate this kitchen is through the luxe prix-fixe.", "yelp_reviews": ["I realllly wanted to love this place, but maybe I was expecting more of a \"mix mix\" menu.  At most I can say the dishes were American/French inspired with a hint of Filipino and Asian influence.  \n\nDefinitely try their cocktails!  They have some very creative ones such as the Silly Rabbit (tequila, carrot/thai chili syrup/mezcal).  They also have some good beers on tap and wines for pairing.  \n\nWe came here on a Saturday night around 5:30 p.m. with no reservations. We opted for the prix fixe menu.  It's a pretty good deal if you want to try multiple things on the menu.  It's $45 per person and each person gets to choose one dish from the snacks, small plates and plates category of the menu.  \n\nFavorites of the night:\n- Tuna \"Poke\" Nachos - Tuna poke with chicharrones as the \"chip.\"  I love chicharrones and these were so light and flaky - such a nice compliment to the poke!  This dish is good to share for 2-3 people for a snack.\n- Tropical Verrine - this was probably the most \"fusion\" thing on the menu, and was definitely my favorite of the night.  It's a modern take on Halo-Halo which includes passionfruit ice cream, coconut panna cotta, lychee and macadamia nuts.  It was such a nice ending to our meal!", "I've been eating Filipino food for awhile now (my whole life). And while the country's cuisine has longtime been a Fear Factor favorite, things are finally starting to turn (i.e. Lasa, Sari Sari, Amboy, Park's Finest and more)\n\nBourdain cites Sisig as being the entry point of conversation into the mainstream food world for first timers but I personally think Adobo might be the better, more appropriate candidate. And in Chef Ross's case at MixMix, it should come standard.\n\nWhile many might criticize Filipino food for being too salty at times. Chef Ross does an incredible job innovating traditional Filipino home cooked favorites yielding new editions and making them work in a way where anyone can appreciate and enjoy. The Pork Cheek Adobo + Albacore Toscada were the two items I sampled (I ate before coming but couldn't resist). But no matter how full you are going in, be sure to save a little bit of room for the Tropical Verrine (modern taken on halo halo) + the chocolate ube cake. Both soon to be new true essentials.\n\nCan't wait to make it back to experience this place in full. This time, I'm coming hungry.", "Love this place as well as Terrace at South Coast Plaza. This location has a cool, modern vibe. My husband and I sat at the bar and ordered the tuna tostada and the Brussels sprouts. Both were yummy but the tostada seemed bigger at Terrace. Anywho, the real cherry on top were the drinks! Amazing cocktails that need to be menu staples but aren't, unfortunately. The guy who was subbing for the bartender the day we went needs to have his own cocktail recipe book or something. You gotta check this place out.", "I had been Insta-stalking MMKB for a while and when the opportunity arose to travel down to Southern Cal for Easter/Spring Break I reached out to the restaurant to find out if they were open for Easter Sunday. To my surprise, Chef Ross Pangilinan replied to me directly and he went above and beyond to forward their pre-fixe Easter menu once my plans firmed up.\n\nOur pre fixe Easter brunch was a gastronomic sampling of Chef Ross' culinary creativity. The starters alone were enough to fill us up: local goat cheese toast, albacore tostada, endive salad, deviled eggs with bacon. The highlight was the duck with thick-cut French toast that was a perfect combination of sweet and savory. And don't forget to order dessert --\nthe chocolate tart is sinfully rich and the tropical verrine is like a taste of a lush, exotic island - bursting with fruit and silky coconut, like a panna cotta.\n\nOh and of course cocktails must be had -- try the Hillbilly and Big Green. Sooo refreshing!", "this place is more like a 3.5 out of 5 stars.\nI've had my eyes set on this place for a while, and it was pretty good. The reason i didn't give it 4 stars is that the menu itself is fairly limited. The entr\u00e9es were only limited to 3 choices. (fish/pasta or steak).\n\nWhen i first walked in, the place seemed fairly small, but they have a separate dining area past a long hallway. (They do have outdoor seating.) We got seated in the back near the kitchen. The kitchen is open, so you can watch the cooks prepare the food.\n\nWe ended up getting the albacore tostada, pork cheek adobo and the market fish, which was salmon for the day.\nOut of the three items, i would recommend getting the pork cheek adobo and the salmon (when they have it). The salmon was crispy and very tender.\nThe pork adobo rice dish was also delicious. (option to add a fried egg for $1)\n\nService was attentive and prompt.\nJust wish the menu had more items to pick from.", "Cute place for date night or catch up dates. I love tapas because I can share and try more dishes. Portions is perfect to share between two people. I came with two girlfriends and some dishes shared between us 3 was a tease.\n\nThe waitress explained that they want you to order all dishes at once so they can prepare and bring it out in a specific order for the best dining experience.\n\nChicharrones - good! Since it's homemade, it's not oily like when you buy it in chips bag. Would I get it again? Probably not.\n\nFilipino ceviche - good. Fish was fresh and tasty\n\nPork cheek adobo - recommend. Rice was flavorful and meat was very soft\n\nDuck leg agnolotti - recommend if you want to try something different. This dish hits the element of sweet and savory.

I was the only one without a suit on but the staff were extremely friendly so no one should feel ill at ease in casual clothes. It's a great big sunny room on the river. Now dinner prices are a lot higher than breakfast. I took a peek. For 10 bucks at breakfast though I had complimentary beignets to start. I ordered the two eggs any style (poached for me) with hash browns and a choice of the usual meats (I had ham and had three enormous slices you could cut with a fork) and choice of toast. Coffee was extra. This was a far better deal and scene with its wall of red leather booths than IHOP at the same price. If you want to meet someone for breakfast in the loop for business or otherwise get. thee to CHICAGO CUT STEAKHOUSE...they do need to improve their hashbrowns....my only complaint on a bright and sunny breakfast.", "I am writing this review based solely on their breakfast.....I stopped by and had their crabmeat eggs benedict and it seriously was one of the best meals I've eaten. Everything about it was gastronomically perfect. It started out with a small surprise of fresh beignets, still hot from the fryer. The crabmeat eggs benedict is highly, highly recommended. Just the right amount of hollandaise, a perfectly cooked poached egg, some grilled asparagus and tomato, and a nice chunk of hash browns shaped almost like a slice of pie. The menu offered various forms of eggs benedict from Canadian bacon, to citrus smoked salmon to petite filets, so I'll just have to find an excuse to go back.", "What happened to this place?

We got drinks quickly but waited forever for refills (finally got our second drinks halfway through the meal.)

The drama surrounding us was another part of the terrible experience. No one was happy, including the waitstaff.

We got the bone in rib eye, filet mignon with 2 scallops, creamed spinach, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, chocolate peanut butter mousse pie, and vanilla ice cream for dessert.

Yes, it\u2019s no front porch in Louisiana, but it\u2019s certainly close.\nThe menu too is rooted in the South, but as often as the chef trots out his grandmother's heirloom recipes, he dishes out creative tweaks, many with Mexican influences.

And I do like the kind that they have at Big Jones. It's syrupy sweet, just the way we like it in the South. But it has a stronger hint of freshly brewed black tea that is often absent from the classic Southern variety. Served with lots of ice and free refills - perfection.\n\nThe interior is very modern and well-lit and prices are reasonable. We went for brunch, and the server brought a little complementary plate of the tastiest freshly-fried beignets completely doused in powdered sugar. So good I wouldn't have minded just having coffee and beignets for brunch if that were an option...\n\nThe brunch menu does not lack in choices, however, and it was difficult to make a decision. I ended up having the corn cakes with Creole-spiced ratatouille and poached eggs. It felt like a healthier alternative with the savory ratatouille full of veggies and the corn cakes bursting with crunchy whole fresh white corn kernels in each bite. The eggs were poached to perfection, runny yolks and all. It was a great, comforting brunch, and with so many menu items, I'll have to be back.", "This seems like a nice place to come for big groups as well as couples. The menu is an upscale interpretation of Southern cuisine that stayed reasonably close to the roots. There are some obvious staples - okra, grits, and collard greens. You will also see the expected gumbo, etouffee, and catfish. Not every item on the menu is a gastronomic sensation - some are not particularly inspired (dumplings are just that) and others are best forgotten. But some were very well executed - the duck, for example, was just the right shade of pink to be succulent (not burnt as is too often the case) and garnished with creative and flavorful sides. Yet others were unexpected in their delightfully tasty simplicity (hint, you'll never think about the hearts of palm the same after eating at Big Jones). The service was pleasantly attentive, knowledgeable, and accommodating. Overall, if you navigate around a few average dishes, this restaurant could offer a fun and tasty way to dine. In my book, it is certainly worth another visit.", "My husband and I came here a couple of months ago when we were in the city. We had dropped off our nephew at a concert and decided to have a nice dinner. We had been wanting to try Big Jones, so we decided on it. Walked in and were told it would be a 30-45 minute wait (not bad for a Friday night). Yes, the place is a bit cramped which kinda sucks, but that's becoming more and more common.\n\nMy husband had the chicken and dumplings, and I had the fried chicken. The chicken and dumplings were pretty spectacular, amazing flavor (even if a bit heavy with the pepper). My fried chicken had great crunch and was very juicy. The seasoning was only slightly lacking (but that's just my taste), and you have to wait if you want fried chicken since it's all fried to order.\n\nService was very good, drinks were also very good.

I liked the set up of the restaurant very much including the open kitchen. One complaint I have (sitting near the kitchen) was the Napoleonic chef screaming out orders like a marine drill sergeant. I found that very distracting as it interrupted our conversations. When we ordered a rum and Coke, the waitress asked us if we wanted ice! There were hundred of bottles of spirits but a very tiny selection of rum. The bill showed an extra charge of $2 for the Coke.  Later, we ordered another Coke that was three dollars.  The crawfish etoufee  was served with the salad after a fair wait and as we ate our salad first so the etoufee was room temperature. We asked them to heat it up. Because we were near the kitchen we heard and saw that one of the cooks was very upset and his reaction was rude. After it was heated up, it was delicious. The cornbread was fantastic but the gumbo was far from New Orleans standards. Also, I like when the music reflects the locale of the cuisine but it didn't ...and it was pretty bad.", "I loved my Sunday brunch here!

Of course, it's hard not to be gush praise when you start with complimentary beignets.\n\nWe split the addictive fried green tomatoes, munched happily into our second courses (country breakfast and cheddar corn cakes, with a side of just-right bacon), and then finished the gorge fest with a serving of bread pudding to-go. Yup. Oink.

There was no way a whole duck only had that little meat on it.\n2- Soup had 8 or 9 pieces of chopped up bones after they removed all the meat for first plate.

The atmosphere was very pretty and upscale and what was to be expected from the photos online. We all ordered our own steaks and shared the bread service, a dozen oysters, the lump crab Caesar, whipped potatoes, and house-cut fries. They bring out the bread service upon request, which I highly recommend you do because it was tasty, soft pretzel balls with garlic butter. The oysters were fresh and loved their house made cocktail sauce and ginger mignonette. The steaks were good and the 5 oz petit-cut filet was satisfying, especially because it came out with cloves of roasted garlic! However, my boyfriend was unimpressed with the supposed 10 oz barrel-cut which looked little bigger than mine. If you're a hungry guy, I'd recommend you go with a larger cut like the New York strip, which my friend was more than happy with. Finally, I'd definitely recommend skipping the fries because they were overly fried to the point of being brown and rather dry. Overall, P&P is a nice Chicago steakhouse to try because of the atmosphere and high-quality food. However, it wasn't the most memorable meal and not worth the $$$$ for another visit imo.", "I have been to many fine restaurants in Chicago Prime and Provisions is by far the best!

The service provided by Ryan, at the bar, is on par with the best. Please do yourself a favor and order an old fashioned. I'm from Wisconsin where that particular cocktail was invented, so I kinda know a good one when I taste one. Moving on to the food...ok. YOU CAN GET BACON AS AN APPETIZER. Yes. It's true. They also have incredible salad selections including the classic wedge salad we know and love. Our server, Duane also effortless guided us through their plentiful wine list. His wine knowledge is something a guest should seek out indefinitely. The Prime rib is also a must.

For our meal we ordered a bottle of the Turley Zinfandel- Rich and Jammy, just right for our taste.\nWe ordered the lump crab cesar salad, and though it was fabulous.... unfortunately there was no crab meat in it. We could not get the attention of the waitstaff to let them know, but the Cesar was so good on its own we ate it anyway.\nOur steak was next level. Center cut porterhouse for the win! It was melt in your mouth deliciousness. Served with some seasoned salt and roasted garlic, it was amazing. Loved that it was pre sliced for us too.

There are so many places where you can get better seafood for cheaper, that I'd feel bad giving this place 5 stars. Ordering oysters by the dozen gets to be pretty expensive - especially when they don't offer a late night HH (or even oysters at all after 11), or better pricing by the dozen. Cheaper and very tasty seafood can be found elsewhere - Blacksalt comes to mind, as does several places on the waterfront and the Maine Ave Fish Market.\n\nLikewise, their cocktails and beers are good, but they lack an actual selection of beers and their both their beers and cocktails are overpriced for what they offer.

The Tchoupitoulas plate has oyster confit with crab, ham, and roasted corn which was soo good. We also ordered the Wood Grilled East Coast Oysters which had garlic butter. For dinner, I ordered the chopped salad which came with popcorn crawfish and had avocado and vegetables. It tasted so fresh and had the perfect amount of food! My parents both got gumbo which they loved and had leftovers. It took us forever to decide what to eat because everything on the menu looks so good.

The sashimi platter were all very good too. So sweet, fresh, fat, well cut, juicy, and succulent. And they had fresh wasabi too which is a major plus. So yes everything was very amazing.

I guess they're not known for the bento box/combo meals.\n\n3) Parking SUCKS. If you eat here, expect valet, mandatory, unless you self-park in the street meters. Also, valets will park your cars ON THE METERS. If they don't constantly check the meters they park your car in for time/money, be prepared for a ticket, or possibly a TOW.\n\n4) I got an Eel roll, and it sucked. barely any eel and mostly rice and cucumber. The Eel sauce is not even tasty.\n\n5) Go to Chiba Restaurant in NoHo.

Checked the wait time on Yelp and it was at zero so we walked over and were seated immediately. The host brought over some Prosecco, which makes the best appetizer! We started with Nonna's Meatballs, which were perfect, and the Bruschetta...I could've had three orders of that as a meal. My wife had a white wine with her Spaghetti alle Vongole...a hint of spicy with the chili, white wine, cherry tomato and clams. I had the Linguine Nero with squid ink pasta, shrimp, squid, mussels and clams. I don't know that we've had such a difficult time choosing what we wanted, every option looked amazing.

I'll rate it as fine, not remarkable but okay. The pasta, was flavorless, not homemade and lacked sauce. How is it possible to be an Italian restaurant and not have fresh pasta and flavorful red sauce. We ate it because we were hungry but unless there are major changes to the food, it's rather institutional, at best. The salad became a topic of conversation as I was amazed they served iceberg lettuce.  I wasn't even sure you could buy this lettuce anymore and unless you're serving a wedge at a steakhouse with blue cheese, it's probably best forgotten.", "I've been here twice and the food is really tasty and authentically Italian for sure.

I know the portions are true to European standards and us here in America are used to double the size. I get it. But in that case, each dish should be priced accordingly. $16.50 for a tiny square of eggplant parmigiana with no bread or pasta/sides with it, is just too expensive.

You won't go wrong with this place.", "I was skeptical when I heard that the servings here are small plates style- I thought it pretty unusual for a pasta-based menu- but it turns out, it worked out decently. Knowing the pasta would not be overwhelmingly large allowed me to choose some healthier options to start: a really delicious salad with apples and a very fresh minestrone soup.

Opt for one of the many tequilas or mezcals for sipping while snacking, preferably on the dip duo of chunky guacamole and creamy choriqueso blended with spicy house chorizo, plus crispy and crunchy chips.

Absolutely perfect. As most places that make margaritas they just throw a mix together with tequila, which are too sweet and sugary for my liking.\n\nService is attentive, but not in an overbearing sense as we never reached an empty glass, even after we were sat at a table for the next three hours of our time at Mercado.\n\nThe atmosphere is lively with mostly young adults in the mid-20's to early 40's, there's music in the background but not so loud with the bustle of the groups that you cannot hear one another.\n\nIf you're looking for good drinks and a fun but not extremely rowdy time, Mercado is the place. The only reason I don't give five stars as considering how busy it is they only have one bathroom per gender. Which lead to wait time, especially as it became more and more crowded.", "Mercado is one of my favorite go-to's for almost any occasion, be it casual or more elevated. The margaritas are always on point. Some of the specials are a spicy watermelon margarita and a spicy cucumber margarita. The only drawback is that they extend the spicy rim down part of the glass and it gets sticky on your hand as the ice melts.\n\nI consider myself a bit of a black bean connoisseur and these beans were fire. The Mexican rice is authentic too. Everything I've ever ordered has been good (jicama shrimp tacos, dos gringas, Chile relleno, enchiladas, etc.) but the shining star is the guacamole. It has big chunks of avocado in it, which sometimes need to be cut down further, and pepitas which give the guac a great texture. The salsa that comes with the chips has a nice heat but isn't too spicy at all.\n\nGreat place to take people who are visiting from out of town. The front windows open up to create indoor-outdoor patio seating as well. Parking is super difficult to find in this area but the valet is only $8 for 2 hours.", "After driving by this place for a few years we finally stopped in to try it and we were so impressed.

Their hibiscus margarita, choriqueso, and potato tacos are my favorite happy hour items. I can fill up on all of these items for under $30 plus tip! The service is also always good and friendly.\n\nI also like coming here for brunch as well. Add carnitas to anything...the chilaquiles, tamales, eggs, huevos rancheros, nachos....anything. It's sooo good. The brunch can get busy if you come late, so come closer to opening if you don't have a reservation.\n\nThere's valet and street parking so pick your poison.

The chips were a bit disappointing since they were not fried right and felt soft/chewy.. but that is probably a fluke thing. We got a very comfy booth with tons of room. The drinks were super!

Now the wood fired oven pie was perfectly cooked and all ingredients were fresh. We were a bit nervous about dessert as I never order any citrus desserts but our server was confident we would like it. She was right! It was just the right balance.

He told us that they encourage family style eating, so we decided to share a couple of dishes. We ended up ordering the Spicy Salami pie and the Garganelli with Ragu. Both were delicious- the pizza crust was thin with good chew, and the house made crushed chilis de arbol were great on it! The ragu was also very meaty and delicious. We enjoyed the food a lot, but the only criticism we had was that the ragu portion size was kind of small for what we paid for it. Because of that, I probably wouldn't recommend ordering the pasta here, but I would definitely come back for the pizza!", "I ate here last weekend with some friends and found the fare ok, but not on par with its contemporaries.\n\nFor starters we had the chicken wings and a pasta dish. I'm not sure then name of the pasta dish but it was essentially buttered noodles and ground pepper. It was well done for what it was but it was pretty simple. Too simple to feel justified ordering at a restaurant. The chicken wings were similarly unmemorable.\n\nI'll be the first to concede that we made a mistake with ordering the pies. We should have ordered a pizza with red sauce. Instead we ordered the white mushroom pie (the Alamo) and the clam pie. I thought both were ok - the mushroom pizza a little too savory for my personal taste, and the toppings of the clam pizza felt bare, almost dry.\n\nOverall, nothing really stood out.

Every staff member was super nice and friendly. We sat on the patio out back and it's pretty well sealed in. The wood fired oven is out there and we got to watch them cook during dinner. We started by sharing the grilled Octopus and it was plenty for two. My wife and I both thought it was the best Octopus we'd ever had. Grilled with olive oil and garlic, served with salad and tomatoes.\nMy wife had the whole grilled snapper with grilled veggies. The waiter deboned the fish beautifully. It was delicious. I had the taste of zacha and it was a piece of swordfish over mussels, shrimp, and homemade black gnocchi. It was just fantastic.\nLooking forward to going back to try out more of the menu.", "New Rochelle has some amazing places and Dubrovnik is definitely one of them. This place is a delight for any seafood connoisseur. They get a hummus style dip with your bread and the paste is thick and savory. Although the wine list has a variety of sparkling wines, if you're looking for something sweet you'll be disappointed. The waitress was very gracious and guided us through the seafood that included the golden snapper, the soft shell crab, the calamari, and the jumbo shrimp. There also an option to split your plate for both appetizers and the main course. I got to try the fettuccini with jumbo shrimp and grilled salmon with risotto. Both were well cooked and savory. Lastly, it does help when you have a couple screens as we were following the Rio Olympics.\n\nThis was my first experience at a Croatian place and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll be back next year for sure.", "Our appetizer was grilled octopus with shredded cabbage and my main course was grilled tuna. My meal was tasty and the service was great. However my partner was dissatisfied with the taste of his food (pork chop).\n\nAs a desert I ordered I believe was called \"palanicka\" which was crepes with peach jam. This was the worst crepe I ever had. It was cold thick and crumbling and very little jam. I was totally disappointed with the desert. I was going to give 3 1/2 start but I can't add 1/2 stars. I leaned on 4 to give it another chance .", "My husband and I went there for dinner a month ago. I had made reservations for 6pm on a Saturday. When we got there the hostess looked us up and down (not a nice feeling) and decided to seat us in the wine cellar downstairs (I guess we weren't main floor appropriate since we were 2 men) even though it was fairly empty (plenty of open tables) upstairs on the main floor.\nWhen we got downstairs there were only 2 other tables that a had diners eating and they put us right next to another gay couple, and when I say next to, I mean that our tables we so close that we could have eaten off each other's dishes, meanwhile the rest of the room was empty. A little buffer room would have been nice. I'll never understand why we were ushered down there. Couldn't help feeling segregated.\nThe food was really tasty and the service was quick but to be treated like that initially left a bad taste in our mouths.\nEveryone should be treated fairly, especially if you want return business.", "Started coming here after we did a family bike trip to the Dalmatian coast.  We loved the food there - simple, fresh and delicious.  You don't hear much in the US about Croatian food - or wine or beer, for that matter.

We have been here several times, usually in the warm weather when you can sit out on their excellent patio overlooking their vegetable garden.

From greeting to check, Prune delivers the whole package. Both Hamilton and wife/co-chef Ashley Merriman create soulful and unpretentious dishes.

Classic French with a comforting twist, the food here was elegant and sophisticated without being pretentious.\n\nThis was my first time eating bone marrow.

In the end, I found it really delicious by spreading it on the toast and topping it with some of the onion. I felt very chi-chi :)\n\nWhile there were several tables packed into the tiny space, it felt more \"homey\" than cramped. All of the food was expertly-prepared, and it was really nice seeing Chef Hamilton cranking plates out of the small kitchen.\n\nMy favorite part about this restaurant was the atmosphere. It almost felt like everyone was just hanging out after work having a drink. And I mean everyone. It was super relaxed and having a great time. That being said, the restaurant is a little noisy and may not be conducive to quiet, romantic date night.

Light, fluffy, deep-fried... what more can a girl ask for?\n\nLast time we went, which was in January we had:\nmonkfish liver with buttered toast (which has to be the best dish ive had, period), white anchovies with some veggies (always delish), trout roe over shaved radishes with brown butter (so so decadent), veal heart with a yogurt dressing (yum), bone marrow (enough said), and sweetbreads with capers and things. delicious delicious delicious! and this amazing ricotta ice cream with brown butter brioche croutons.\n\nGet your butt over to Prune.

The clams were perfectly cooked (not over cooked), sweet with a slight bite of garlic - perfect (razor clams are one of my favorite foods).

Now it has a new look and a new name. Tucked into a cut through mid block, this wine bar is said to be run by Le Bernardin's master sommelier, Aldo Sohm.  My friends and I shared a cheese plate and grabbed a few glasses of wine here on a Wednesday evening.\n\nWe shared the artisanal cheese selection of 4 for $24. Each cheese was paired with a garnish like honey or quince.  The portion of cheese was very small, but they were from Murray's, so they were delicious. The bread that they served with the plate was a good compliment to the cheese as well.\n\nThe wines by the glass here range from $12-$70, with most in the $17-$22 area. I tried the Pinot noir which was good, but at $20 not better than most $12 or $15 glasses I have had.\n\nNamed one of the 13 Most Beautiful Bars in NYC from Thrillist, they took the space and redecorated really well. In real life it really does look like its pictures.", "If there's a better wine bar in NYC, I'd like to know about it.\n\nThe room is very modern, with a central U-shaped couch and a large tasting table along the back wall, with some smaller high-top tables along the walls. Plenty of space to share dishes and relax.\n\nThe wine selection is extensive with a well-curated by-the-glass list. While the average prices are a bit higher than a standard bar, you're paying for quality. For example, my last visit started with a French chardonnay flight which was designed to highlight the differences in soil qualities at different elevations. My bartender was able to produce maps and photos of the growing region which made the tasting an even richer experience.\n\nThe food is very good, especially the buttered/truffled/yak cheese pasta, which will be the first thing I order on every subsequent visit.\n\nGreat date spot and a great place to bring the wine aficionado in your life.", "NYC has lots of wine bars and I think this is really the tops of the genre.   I thought the food was all really excellent and the portions a bit more generous than you typically get from the format.  That isn't to say that it's cheap, it certainly isn't and if you aren't used to NYC small plates prices you might be shocked.  Still I thought the Tuna, Carrots, Cheese Plate, and Panino were all fantastic.  Coq-au-vin was OK, but didn't blow me away (they did include a third drumstick with the two we ordered).\n\nWines by the glass were great with a lot of variety and interesting stuff.  There are some insanely expensive wines on there, but plenty of stuff in the $12-20 range.

The interior is undeniably cozy, with low plushy couches, hanging lights from the gorgeous high ceilings and modern art adorning all the walls.\n\nUnfortunately I feel like there's an identity crisis going on here. The space is too big and corporate to truly be a romantic wine bar, but has too much of a \"date-night\" or \"girls night\" feel to it to properly cater to the working crowd in the area.\n\nThe wine selection was good, with 1 page of by the glass choices and pages upon pages of bottle options, which seemed to span across a good price range.\n\nThe food was disappointing though. I would say a charcuterie board is probably the safest bet if you're hungry, but I'd just stick with drinks and grab dinner elsewhere.\n\nThe whole baked cauliflower was probably the highlight of the menu, but the seasoning was unevenly distributed leading to a overly  salty top and bland bottom. The truffle pasta was overly greasy and something I would expect from one of the tourist traps in Times Square. And the spicy lamb was dwarfed by the pita it came with, although our waitress did warn us the lamb is about the size of her index finger.", "Take over the U-shaped sofa with a group of friends. It's easy to have fun here.. cool, approachable, no-pressure wine bar embracing questions and exploration. The Keith Haring paintings and brighter-than-dim lighting keep the place young and energetic, but not sure if I understand the eclectic assortment of trinkets showcased on bookshelves everywhere. Would love to hear the backstory on this :)\n\nThe Tower is a spinning, charcuterie stand of salami, rillettes, pate, lardo, ham.. you name it.

Grilled Foie Gras Lollipops were unavailable when I had visited but heard solid feedback about this one. Other menu items didn't quite do it for me but the wine - not the food - should be the main idea here. I should also probably stop hoping Bernadin dishes will line out of the kitchen, ha.\n\nIf you're exploring and finding your identity within the wine world, order any of the Flights. It's a great way to preview and taste a general spectrum. Plus, they make great conversation starters.

As for the wine...to be honest, I wasn't overly impressed with the wines by the glass.  I didn't really enjoy the syrah and as a pinot noir lover, I wasn't too happy that the one kind they had was $19.  That's leaning towards the pricey side when you're going to have more than one glass.  But the Argentinian variety was outstanding.  The list of bottles, however, is quite extensive with various price points...the recommended way to go.

Our most recent dinner there, we had a zucchini free form ravioli, little gem salad, grilled pork chops, and a honey pie. Every course was mouth watering and gorgeous to look at.

It totally worked, fish and mash, I've never had that combo. Then, they brought out a cheese platter with chili plums. Again, yum! The dessert was also incredible, some layered chocolate praline cake with crunchy bits.\nThis comes all in a setting that has totally captured the essence and charm of Mendocino County.

A split a verdict on the appropriateness as a starter/amuse bouche.  \n\nThe first course was celeriac, leek & potato soup, fried shallots & piment chili.  It was fairly tasty, although served a little too hastily after we sat down and before we had ordered wine.\n\nNext was smoked trout with pickled vegetables, avocados and toasts.  The trout was a little too salty, but this was the highlight of the meal.  \n\nThe main entree was duck breast over farro with pomegranate and feta.

The texture is so delicate with lightly charred crispy edges and a silky interior. The grilled prawns come with a sauce that is zesty and spicy, and the shrimp themselves are pretty sizable and juicy. The slow roasted lamb neck is just perfectly cooked.

Try Dan's \"Il Palio.\"\n\nCall ahead for a reservation. Put your name on a list to sit at the bar. Excellent service, food, ambiance, and timing.", "We have lived in the neighborhood for over a decade.  It's always handy for a take-out order on the way home.  We also frequently stop in for lunch or the mid-afternoon menu.  The cod sandwich is an old and reliable stand-by.   However, having been regular patrons for 12 years, they still never seem to remember us to the extent that we would be warmly greeted at the door or bar.  (We remember their names!)  Our main complaints/observations would be the closeness of the tables, such that your neighbors derriere brushes by your plate upon seating and there can be no semblance of private conversation, the rising prices, and more importantly the stale menu.  At this point, we have exhausted the fare options offered for dinner as well as lunch.  In short, the menu needs to be updated and the number of tables reduced.  I agree with the reviewer who finds that they are complacent due to the fact of the limited nearby competition.  Reading the standards evinced by other reviewers' remarks, it does seem that these days folks do not expect or demand the quality we deserve and pay for at establishments such as Wood Tavern."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-tavern-oakland?hrid=vwffe3F35G_R--9Yy_3veQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-tavern-oakland?hrid=2az-WoZX32q-amdXb-4MSg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-tavern-oakland?hrid=KQe5HFcCkw7uQuZq8Ng0eg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-tavern-oakland?hrid=Cx0VGlnvpldC2A_hfdCPDw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-tavern-oakland?hrid=locZ453Ajj7GWW7QVonxLQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/wood-tavern-oakland?hrid=I1rISHsMsCOHJ2ezII26Mw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Father\u2019s Office", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/father%E2%80%99s-office", "michelin_pov": "This may appear to be a counter-service, first-come first-serve sort of joint for grabbing a bite, but Chef Sang Yoon has turned this\u2014and the humble burger\u2014into so much more. Made with dry-aged beef, caramelized onions and bacon compote, the elevated wares found in this kitchen are treasured as one of the country\u2019s first (and perhaps finest) craft burgers. The market-driven menu goes on to include items that one would not expect from a pub\u2014imagine an heirloom tomato salad with Persian cucumbers dressed in a sweetened basil-goat\u2019s yogurt sauce; or even grilled skewers of deliciously spiced Sonoma lamb.\nHoused in the historic Helms Bakery district, this Culver City location is more modern and comfortable than the Santa Monica original.", "yelp_reviews": ["I love Father's Office!!!!!  Hamburgers are definitely within my top 3 favorite foods in the world, so when I moved to Southern California aka every foodie's dream land, I knew that I had to go on a mission to find the best hamburger.  I had heard of Father's Office for a very long time and when I had the opportunity to try the Father's Office in Santa Monica, I was floored.  The burger was everything that I imagined it to be (and believe me, I had VERY HIGH expectations) and more.  \n\nThe burger goes without saying is absolute perfection.  All of the flavors compliment each other perfectly.  The gruyere and Maytag bleu cheeses, onions caramelized in bacon, arugula, and perfectly cooked patty placed on a pillowy roll (not bun!) = heaven in my  mouth.  It's an excellent blend of flavors and textures.  I also had the regular fries and sweet potato fries, which were both very tasty, especially with the aioli.  I like the sweet potato fries more though.  So amazing!!!!  \n\nAside from the food, I like this particular location more than the Santa Monica one.  This one is much bigger and has more tables, has outdoor seating, valet parking, and a more expansive menu.", "To start, I'm not a huge burger person. But after the moment my mouth touched that burger, I knew something changed in me.\n\nFather's office was a great experience. I had the typical father's office burger---cooked medium rare, I may go crazy some day and get it rare (but we shall see how crazy I am in a few weeks).\n\nThe fries were perfectly fried and deliciously salted to perfection.\n\nThe burger----the burger was something else. Served with Gorgonzola cheese., caramelized onions, and a perfectly toasted baguette. This combination all together made my mouth jump for joy.\n\nThe bartender also matched a beer to my liking which was refreshing, light, and sort of orange-tangy. I forget the name, somethign Alaskan?\n\nI will definitely go here again to try to bone marrow, which someone at the table (it's a community table type of place---first come first serve or elseeee) had it and I wanted to nudge them to see if I could have a bite-----tempting but I didn't do it.\n\nIf you're a burger person---then go here. If you're not---go here, it'll change your life.", "Father's Office: an exercise in masochism.\n\nWait in line at the bar, order your office burger, a basket of sweet potato fries, a glass of your favorite snobby microbrew. Then stake a claim next to a table, watching in pain as hordes of yuppies eat their delicious burgers, not giving your waiting and suffering a second thought.\n\nBut it's okay, because the burger is simply that good. You can't blame Sang Yoon for not allowing any alterations to his creations. The flavors strike a masterfully harmonious balance: dry-aged beef, arugula (my favorite green!), gruyere cheese, a mystery sauce; all good individually, even better together. Crisp sweet potato fries with a sauce that's just sweet enough. La Fin Du Monde.\n\nSome might take issue with the atmosphere, but as a place that's upscale but not fancy and casual but not overly informal, I think it's the perfect place to catch up with a friend, grab dinner after work (thus all the suits) or even go on a date, assuming you don't go on a night where you wait an hour for a table.\n\nThis place is one of my favorite restaurants anywhere and gets a five well-deserved stars.", "This was my first time trying out Father's Office in Culver City, in the Helms Bakery District.  \n\nI have to give this place a solid 4.  We ended up sharing two appetizers and the Father's Office Burger.  The appetizers were great!  I personally thought the burger was good; however, not spectacular.\n\nThis is a bar/counter service restaurant.  This means that you sit where you want and you place your order at the bar. The food is then delivered to you.  The good news is that you usually don't have to wait long at the bar.  They had three bartenders that night, and the place was to capacity.  There really wasn't any wait.\n\nI do love the outdoor seating area.  They are picnic type tables, that you can share with others.\n\nOverall, I have to give this place a 4, which in my book, is really good!", "With over 5,000 reviews, most of us know how awesome the Father's Office burgers are by now. So I'm gonna skip that part and tell ya about the yummy Berbere Spiced Lamb!\n\nIt might be a seasonal menu item (don't quote me on that). For one skewer, it is on the pricier side but it is one FULL ass skewer of lamb meat. It's served with perfectly pickled cucumbers, cilantro, onions and red bell peppers on top of a cilantro (or some other green herb) yogurt sauce.\n\nYes, you probably can find lamb skewers elsewhere for cheaper. However, it won't have the same kind of finesse in flavors as you will find at Father's Office which is why I think it's worth the money. But if you're looking for a plate to get you full, just get the burger or order the lamb as an appetizer.", "This is a really interesting place.  The chef, Sang is a very eccentric character.  For example, he will not allow ketchup in this place because he hates it so much.  Of course, the sauce he serves with his fries is 10 times BETTER than ketchup.  The drinks are great; he has a lot of unusual and old-fashioned cocktails and the wine is always on tap.  I don't really like beer, but I can tell you that if you do, this is the place to go.  He has TONS of beers and from all over the world.\n\nFun Fact:  The burger here was rated the second best burger IN THE COUNTRY."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles?hrid=_btIY6ziIygnEesi5P_mhA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles?hrid=NyXG4EfSCJfr7VTn2QXuJg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles?hrid=S3F-VK3S7AD9fIxTTclcCg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles?hrid=BhtL1IY1yyILOdGsz4X57g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles?hrid=ao74cib-avFV_jamvh1_FA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles?hrid=4ESrV4I1ZcXN65Tn66J-cQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}]
