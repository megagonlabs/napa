Now, with Il Divo, he\u2019s impressing stateside. The small space exudes charm and elegance with 1920s movie posters and sparkling chandeliers. The exceptionally warm staff adds to the inviting ambience\u2014the manager may even stop by with a complimentary grappa at meal\u2019s end. The menu focuses largely on Northern Italian cooking with a few classics sprinkled in. Beef tenderloin, poached in olive oil and tossed with arugula and Parmesan crisps, melts in your mouth. The 12 eggs spaghetti isn\u2019t flashy but is so well executed, and the bacon-wrapped scallops over chickpea bisque is a delightful dish. The wine list leans Italian but features some exciting bottles at palatable prices.", "yelp_reviews": ["Il Divo has been on my list for quite some time and it didn't disappoint. The service was professional and old-world, and the food was classic but also creative and thoughtful.\n\nI started with the warm lobster salad with lychee dressing. A bright, fun and unusual dish. While the balance wasn't perfect, the inventiveness made up for this.\n\nNext I had stuffed squash blossoms that were done to perfection.  This can be such a hit or miss dish but everything about them was perfection. Perfectly crisp, just the right amount of grease, good cheese to blossom ratio, and sitting on a small pool of squash bisque that enhanced the flavor of the squash blossom.\n\nNext a burrata stuffed agnolotti with a poached cherry tomatoes and prawns. The agnolotti were bigger than I'm used to which I didn't mind, but they were closer to ravioli as a result. The rich tomato sauce clearly used a stock made from prawn shells and it was a beautiful touch to this dish. The prawns were large and very nice quality.\n\nFor dessert I had a lemon mouse that was nice but nothing to write home about.\n\nI ended up finishing my meal with two glasses of port because it was the sort of place that makes you want to linger.\n\nI've definitely found a new neighborhood spot.", "There is a reason why it's tough to get a reservation at IL DIVO -- it's excellent, in every way. Managers Christian & Allessandro & Chef Matteo make you feel like you're a guest in their (swanky) home. The food is superb...the much-loved eggplant Parmesan melts in your mouth. The salads are excellent, all the way through to dessert...with an outstanding wine list. Can't wait to be welcomed in to this wonderful addition to the UES again soon!", "Went with a couple friends and had a great time! Upon sitting down and getting a bottle of wine a bread basket was quickly whisked to our table and I personally scarfed down a disgraceful amount of the focaccia which was still warm from the oven and pillowy soft. I know these people mean business because even the olive oil and balsamic were branded with an amusing little sticker. We ordered and a few minutes later the waiter came over with a delectable red pepper stuffed with tuna thing( I could've eaten like 10 of these things) compliments of the kitchen. When we asked about the amuse we were told that it changed nightly and if I lived closer I'd probably be here all the time. I ordered the bolognese which must be the chef's specialty because it was sinfully good. Despite summer being around the corner let my summer body be damned! I'm more than happy to trade it for this pasta. My friends actually saved me from being a glutton when they said let's split desserts. So I got to try a delicate dark chocolate mousse with meringue on top (was nice for the crunch) and a panna cotta with berry sauce that was like spring in a dessert with the consistency of velvet.", "A very welcome addition to the UES!\n\nBeautifully decorated. Warm. Welcoming. Elegant. But still comfortable.\n\nAs delicious as the food is - have the octopus, the agnolotti - the scallops!!- the staff is even better!\n\nChristian the manager is charming and kind. Daniela the bartender a character with fun energy and mixes a perfect Negroni.  \n\nAntonio the owner is a character and a restauranteur to his core\n\nGo. Enjoy. Mangia!", "Decent food but an absolute rip off. The prices are really insane. $33 for three shrimp appetizer are they kidding. I went and looked at the menu online beforehand and the prices were high and then went to the restaurant and the prices on the website were $2 lower than on the actual menu. That's a gimmick as they can't say they changed them the place just opened. Cmon!! They don't even give you any extras except one ok cup of pasta sauce. They should at least give you a little dessert cookies or something at the end. They really have nerve charging those prices for what you get good food but at outrageous prices. Unless they cut their prices by 20% I won't be back.", "Il Divo is an Upper East Side gem! Five star hospitality the second one walks through the door. Guglielmo and the Lady in Red pleasantly greeted me and took my coat and knapsack while handing me a coat-check ticket. Then Christian Montero, the manager, introduced himself as we were being seated. He was engaging and periodically checked on my friend and I throughout the evening to ensure we were having a great time. Dianela(?), the mixologist, made excellent espresso martini's for me. Il Divo, with its Ralph Lauren wallpaper, antique furnishings and curtains, has a luxury apartment feel to it. Il Divo translates \"The Movie Star\" and is dedicated in homage to Rudolph Valentino. Photographs and movie posters beautifully adorn the walls. Matteo Limoli is the Executive Chef. Not only did he converse with us, he also took a picture with us. I asked for him because his pan seared octopus and broccoli covered with an anchovy sauce were the best of those dishes I've ever experienced. The Roast Chicken is magnificently seasoned and stands on its on. Everything about Il Divo was Five Star and they appear ready to be Superstars in the neighborhood.", "This is a fabulous new Italian restaurant.  They also have one in Milan.\nthe room is pretty and decorated with pictures of Rudolf Valentino.\nIt is small, comfortable and great for conversation.  Tables are well spaced.  The dishes they offer are not like most Italian restaurants in NYC.  I had lasagna and was delighted by what they served - not the usual three inches high bomb that most places serve.  Instead it is two layers of very light pasta sheets with appropriate filling and covered by meat sauce; it was utterly delicious.  My wife had osso buco, which was wonderful and not the usual bone-on giant most restaurants serve - instead, the meat was scraped off the bone and served that way.  It, too was utterly delicious.  Desserts were wonderful and light - a perfect end of a great meal.  Service is prompt, friendly and accommodating. It is not inexpensive, but it is worth every penny.  Make reservations, because once it is discovered (only opened during the summer of 2019) it will be hard to get in."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-divo-new-york-2?hrid=YuUfWZpTE259WgNRO5SRQA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-divo-new-york-2?hrid=G4jLjwWd8wiYc2StgPdg4w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-divo-new-york-2?hrid=xHZSsKgGQv7MDDFrbWwD_Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-divo-new-york-2?hrid=pn1H2HzJnRweqP9zrYhP8Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-divo-new-york-2?hrid=aSvzzLyzuhCx12uYJ3y6YQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-divo-new-york-2?hrid=-zBaQPJutUw6H-vs5blGEQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-divo-new-york-2?hrid=W9x6uufXW2cnQz23GCDmkA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Berber Street Food", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/berber-street-food-new-york-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/berber-street-food", "michelin_pov": "For excellent pan-African cuisine, head to this beloved West Village service counter. There are only a handful of seats, but with colorful accent pillows and decorative baskets hanging on the walls, the mood is upbeat.

But, if you\u2019re seeking a dish to savor, order the four-hour roasted lamb. It\u2019s worthy of a fine-dining operation and hints at Chef Tandia\u2019s time at Per Se among other top kitchens.\nJust one dessert is made daily and sells out quickly.

We came at around 5:30pm on a Monday night. There was one diner inside, already eating.\nThere are only a couple of seats, so it's not a place I'd recommend to eat  in, the interior is also very bare bones. We ordered and paid at the counter before sitting down. There was only one cashier, and she was friendly.\nThe menu does not contain many items, and features food from the African diaspora, ranging from African and Caribbean influenced dishes.\nWe waited about 15-20 minutes for our food. I had the afro fusion bowl atop greens. It came with kidney beans, and plantains. It was not bad, but also something I felt like I could easily make at home on my own. My husband got a chicken wrap, which was the least African of the items on the menu here. He said it was decent, but didn't finish it.\nBased on this experience, I probably wouldn't recommend or return.", "Want to they something  different with a lot of flavor, head to this awesome little spot in the West Village.\n\nIf you want to see a vid, check put my post on youtube\n\nyoutu.be/mD-gEN_zB00\n\nChef Diana is creating magical taste in this cozy spot. The food is a fusion of North Africa and a little Caribbean.  My favorite is the chicken  empanadas! I liked them so much I ordered  a tray to take home for Thanksgiving. The dough is. Ade in house and is so soft. Each bite is a dream. They have vegetarian and meat options.\n\nI've been here twice and had a great food each time. The Camel burger is also something worth trying if you are a burger fan. It's lean meat and done really well. It's called the Nomad burger.\n\nIts grilled ground Camel,  Herbs and Berber Spices, Harissa aioli on a  Brioche Bun\n\nThey have food bites like Tapas, afro fusion bowls, sandwiches and a few house specialties.\n\nI also had their home made juices and tea. Which are really good.\n\nIt's a small spot with about 4 tables and counter service. The neighborhood is awesome and there are great spots on this street.", "This little nook of a restaurant is located in West Village, and the owner serves up tasty fusion dishes influenced by a range of cuisines from African countries such as Morocco, Senegal, and Nigeria.\n\nI recommend starting with the accara. These black-eyed pea fritters were perfectly spiced, and I loved the chunky and flavorful tomato, onion, and lemon zest sauce they came with.\n\nMy friend got the Nomad Burger made with grilled ground camel meat. It was cooked medium/medium rare and was very tender (although I don't think I'd be able to distinguish it from beef). I ordered the Djolof Fried Rice, my go-to Senegalese dish, and it was spicy, packed with flavor, and comforting.\n\nI also enjoyed the ginger lemongrass juice. It had more notes of ginger than anything, but it was zingy, refreshing, and not too sweet.\n\nThey also have rotating daily specials. Unfortunately the ones I wanted to try were sold out for the night, but I guess that gives me one more reason to come back.", "Berber Street Food is a complete gem! The restaurant occupies a small spot on wonderful Carmine Street. Diana Tandia is the chef and her menu represents some of the most delicious small plates from North Africa. We read the menu online in advance so that we could appreciate the types of spices and sauces and order accordingly. We started with Accara. These black-eyed fritters come with a spicy tomato sauce and are delicious bites. Next, we ordered three dishes - Mauritanian lamb feast which is a lamb shoulder that has been marinated for 24 hours and is served with seasonal vegetables and cous cous, yummy! Merguez sausages grilled to perfection. We were curious about fufu and had the mafe pot which had seasonal vegetables. Not only is Diana Tandia a talented chef, she is a delight as well. Try something new - go to Berber Street Food!", "GET THE AFRO FUSION BOWL WITH JERK CHICKEN AND TURMERIC RICE!!!\nSeriously, just do it. I absolutely loved it - jerk chicken was appropriately spicy, turmeric rice had a nice, strong turmeric flavor, and the two flavors complement each other very well. I had the Caravan Shawarma with lavender/herb fries as well, it was interesting and tasty and I'd give that a 4/5, but the jerk chicken bowl is something I will get again and again.\n\nI ate everything so quickly that I forgot to take pictures...", "Beautifully presented food and great flavors, but the price was a little much for the size of the portions, and the service was not the best. We ordered two of the appetizers for a snack and were not expecting to be full on this, but each one was literally four small bites with a few leaves of salad. Also, one of the skewers was lukewarm and the other was completely cold. This was for $19 and after waiting almost 25 minutes. They took another 5 minutes to heat it up when we asked. Why couldn't it have just been done that way in the first place? It really did not match the fast casual feel. We went to another place to eat after because we were still so hungry.", "Such a fun place to eat at! The owner told me that she has been open for a few months now and she's enjoying it. Her food offerings are unique and really tasty. The presentation is fun too as she has collected wooden dishes from Thailand, etc. from what I remember, there are only three tables that can each seat 4 people + a few stools that a couple of people can sit at.

It was a 6-course Elevated Seasonal Dinner Series.\n\nThe inside is a bit small, long and narrow with a beautiful bar.

They were all very good in quality, some more interesting than other, and all very tasty. I especially enjoyed the grilled tuna, fried whitebait, and Pork & Clam dishes.\n\nThey don't try to offer something super fancy, but more \"everyday food\" that are homey with comfy flavors.

Having dinner with a great company always makes the food taste better, thanks guys! The staffs were efficient and polite, they did a nice job taking care of us as a whole.

I would like to go back and try some other dishes in a future.", "Houseman is a charming and quiet little restaurant in the neighborhood. I had been wanting to check it out for a while, especially since its burger received such rave reviews. \n\nThe BF & I shared the roasted carrots with pumpkin seeds, ricotta, and honey to start. It was a lovely vegetable dish. We then each had our own burger with all the fixings - Swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and a heaping side of fries. The dish looked great, but my god was it salty! The BF's fries were so salty he couldn't finish half (unlike him) and almost sent them back. It had potential, but not worth the high price point and definitely not worth feeling parched for a full day after!", "We made a lunch pilgrimage to Houseman on a recent visit to NYC; it was spurred by a mention in the NY Times by Sam Sifton about its great steak frites. Since I worship at the altar of steak frites, I had to try it. Suffice it to say that the dish tied for Best Steak Frites Ever in my book - tasty steak, perfectly cooked, and frites like manna from heaven, with fresh flavor and golden crispiness all the way to the bottom of the stack. My companion's roast chicken was also  delicious, as was a fresh, simple side salad. Good wine, friendly staff, cheerful vibe -- it all put big smiles on our faces. 5* may be an overstatement, but steak frites like this blur my moral judgement. I'd love to return on a future trip...", "Excellent and creative food in a beautiful setting, and delicious drinks to boot.  The fried fava beans were simply amazing -- how has no one else thought of this?  If you fried me up a bowl of those right now, I would be one happy man.  The sausage was excellent, very rich, very interesting.  The menu was small, but it was one of those where you sort of left thinking that you wish you could have finished the set -- sure, you ate half the menu, but you really wonder what the other half would have been like.  Definitely one I'll be hitting up again.\n\nWas it expensive?  Not for this neighborhood, not even remotely.  It's perfectly in line with what other restaurants charge for this caliber of food.\n\nWas it a little out of the way?  Well, for me -- I wanted to try the hot new place, and this was it, but, yeah, I actually had to walk three blocks from the subway...  But it was definitely worth it.", "We gave up waiting for a famous overhyped place around the corner and found Houseman--foodie haven, low-key polite service and very honest informed friendly wait staff. It is quiet and elegant in a minimalist mode\n\nWe ordered a selection of starters, mostly vegetarian, delicious corn, radishes, some shrimp. We got good wine advice. They were sold out of their Sunday night special goat stew but the  appetizers we had were delicious. Not cheap but excellent value.", "Stumbled upon Houseman a couple weeks ago and tested the waters with a glass of wine since we had already had dinner. Loved the open air concept so much that we had to come back for brunch.\n\nToday, we tried the smoked trout with rye crackers and the burger.\n\nTrout: very light, but substantial. Great touch with the rye crackers.\n\nBurger: wow, delicious. Perfect size with double patties. The bun, along with the Beef created a very soft and tender bite full of flavor.\n\nGreat place to relax and or even bring the family, all seem much welcome here.", "I'm a big fan of Gabrielle Hamilton's Prune, so when I learned that Houseman owner Ned Baldwin used to be chef de cuisine at Prune, I put Houseman on my must-try list. Though I'm not a vegetarian, I tried the grilled zucchini sandwich and absolutely loved it. Service was thoughtful and warm, and the drinks menu was creative and inviting. Will definitely return.", "Lots of things are solid, if at times way too salty.\n\nThe steak on the other hand, can be a complete and utter ripoff.

The crab Rangoon was the best I've ever had I hate to admit.

I try to get in a couple of nice dinner dates with the lady around the holidays so we came here on a Friday night (12/16/16) before life became hectic with work parties and traveling.  I'm happy to say we really enjoyed our meal.\n\nIt seems difficult to get a table during peak hours so I made a reservation on OpenTable far in advance.  Sure enough, this place was hopping from the moment we walked in and far after we left.  The restaurant is unassumingly beautiful, consisting of sleek table settings and attractive d\u00e9cor.  The atmosphere was lively, and our server was able to keep up with the pace.\n\nThe food was great.  We started with a couple of cheeses to pair with our wine, and the one featuring truffle was particularly tasty.  Next were the dayboat scallops, followed by the garganelli (mushroom, ragu, ricotta salata) and gnocchi (rabbit, tomato, basil, parmesan) pastas.  We thought the crudo and pasta dishes were well prepared and flavorful.  We capped things off with a delicious hazelnut chocolate torta.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant, and I will certainly be back for seconds!", "I always come back to L'Artusi. It seriously is delicious, and worth trying to get a reservation.\n\nThe service is welcoming, you can get a good bottle of wine for around 50, the tables are well spaced out, and the atmosphere is kind of like....sexy modern living room? Whatever. The food is bonkers good---tasty, simple, and every element is well cooked without being over salted or over spiced.\n\nI go completely crazy over the butter lettuce salad. It's lemony and creamy and funky and nutty without being overwhelmingly so on any of those parts. It's something I order ever time as an appetizer. I also really love the octopus: cooked well and to a great char, with crispy potatoes, spicy chili, and olives. And of course, the pasta: I enjoy the bolognese bianco but you can't really go wrong with any of them--all have a great bite and a well-sauced coating.\n\nSometimes I feel like dining out can feel like an episode of Chopped--- just a bunch of ingredients that you wouldn't think go together piled on a plate to make a very busy entree. I love the simplicity and attention to detail of this restaurant.", "Unusual interior, with 2 floors and plenty of bar seats all over the first floor (even too many... we kinda felt cramped). The menu has lots of interesting dishes... hard to choose.\n\nBeef carpaccio: delicious; perfect combination between tender and crunchy.\n\nCharred octopus: I'm sorry to contradict most yelpers, but this entree was disappointing; dry and tough, and barely warm.\n\nOrecchiette with sausage & salumi sauce: fantastic, and very sizable.\n\nHanger steak: I asked it medium rare, and it came more on the rare side, but I was ok with that; I only wish it had come warmer. The potatoes were very good (and generous). I didn't feel like sending it back, because we had just sent back their sweetbreads, which were dry and barely warm. We felt like both dishes had been waiting for a while.\n\nOlive oil cake: the dessert was well balanced; the cream, raisins and cake complemented each other, and the salt helped our palates not feeling overwhelmed by the overall sweetness. However, the cake itself was quite plain... surely not memorable.\n\nBottom line: we had a good dinner. Nevertheless, there were mistakes on critical dishes we couldn't overlook. For what you pay, u'd expect a much more consistent quality. 3.5 stars.", "Two of us went here for a fancy Italian dinner. We didn't have reservation so we waited around 35 minutes.

She was really helpful on selecting a wine to pair with our food. We like to drink wine but we don't know enough to choose from a large menu. She picked perfect wines for us with very simple questions. The price of glass of wines were reasonable too.\n\nOverall, the food tasted very good. My favorite was Quail. We also had Pork Tortellini, Hamachi, and Asparagus. They all tasted good but I wished the portion were a little bit larger.\n\nWe ended up leaving the restaurant feeling still hungry after spending $106 before tip. It's definitely a good place to hang out but maybe not when you are hungry.", "Came here for the pasta, was blown away by the olive oil cake!\n\nDefinitely make a reservation. The downstairs seating is very comfy, the upstairs dining area is extremely noisy, and is hard to hold a conversation without yelling when they're busy.\n\nGet any of their pastas and you'll be happy, but be sure to leave room for dessert!

The Lumpia Shanghai didn't have much meat in it, and the carrot/daikon and sauce it came with were way too overly sweet. The wrapping for the lumpia is also usually more dense and crispy in true Filipino cuisine while this was more reminiscent of a spring roll wrapper. My boyfriend got the beef tapa dish. While it was flavorful, the ends of the beef seemed a bit too burnt for him to comfortably eat, or even really distinguish what the beef marinade should have tasted like. The Lechon Kawaii is definitely the best dish to get, but even then presentation of the dish was careless, and again, the pickled papaya tasted way too sweet. It's certainly a unique/creative dining experience though enough for me to have seen it crowded during the weekend, but as someone who loves Asian-fusion, this wasn't what I hoped it could have been. Regardless, again, it's worth trying at least if you pass by!", "When I told a FOB Phillipino that I was introduced to a Phillipino place for brunch, he gave me the side eye.

I loved the pavlova dessert and came back here again in our short 4 day stay and that is rare on a vacation. The food is a bit pricey though and the portions were bigger if you stayed than took it to go which is rare to see imo. I highly recommend this place but it does get busier at certain times.

On a menu so small, how do you run out of chicken-on-a-stick before the dinner rush?\nThe Vietnamese Wings were fun, but I was laughing more at the price: $16 for three flats and three drums, a total of three whole wings. They were good wings, with a nice fish sauce but $5 per wing is a lot.\nI love that they have cocktails for takeaway, the curiously strong Fall of Saigon is balanced and refreshing.\nThe Crispy Duck Salad is a lighter option, with duck bits, greens, and grapes. The peanuts and fish sauce-based dressing add some Asian flair. Overall enjoyable if not for the $18 price tag.\nMie Goreng, aka chow mein. It's good chow mein, but the price of $13 is just too much for a half-pint of Chinese takeout with a fancy label. This iteration is definitely bare-bones, and you'd get four times the quantity at any PF Chang's.\n\nAll the dishes have the same flavor: spicy. They are liberal with the chilis and I give them props for it. Unfortunately the portions just don't match the prices.", "Came here on Mother's Day after being turned away from some other brunch places that were full. It was fantastic! We all had the fixed brunch menu which included a tofu omelet, short rib hash, and toast with bananas and strawberries. I would definitely recommend both the tofu omelet with it's yummy gado gado salad and peanut dressing and the short rib hash that had a poached egg on top.\n\nThe front of the restaurant was pretty empty when we got there which made us nervous but everyone was out back eating on the patio.

The buns were soft and pillowy, while the bottom was pan fried nicely and coated with sesame.  So good with the vinegar sauce too.\n* Shrimp and pork wontons in chili oil - The wontons were kind of on the smaller side.

Everything was done extremely well.  The pan fried dumplings were my favorite.  The dough was soft with a sesame seed pan fried crust, and the filling was well seasoned.  The XLB skin was thin, but didn't fall apart and let all the soup escape.  \n\nI feel like the sauce for the spicy won tons needed to be a little thicker, but was still tasty.  I also wish they had spicy pig ear, or beef tendon.  That's usually one of my favorite things to eat with dumplings.  The menu isn't the largest for a dumpling place, but it's done really well.  They also have a glass window into the kitchen so you can watch how your food is made.

The flavors were balanced, deep and delicious and everything they should be. The black truffle ones (serving of 4) were my favorite, the soup and the pork were just as rich as can be and just a little more umami.\n\nThe potstickers were golden, crispy, and hot without too much dough getting in the way like some restaurants do if the dough is too thick. The stir-fried noodles had good flavor and the shrimp were perfect (about 6 per dish), but probably we would just order more xiao long bao until we couldn't eat any more!\n\nThe place was crowded (an hour from lunch closing time) but we snagged a table right away and our server Joelle was very friendly and efficient and this seems to be a real family-run operation.\n\nWe'll be back to get more of those soup dumplings!", "Menu as of 3/1/20 - A LOT OF ITEMS have been removed (see the taped off menu).\n\nWe ordered a lot of items to share/try because we had six people.

Top three worse items from our order are:\n\nStir-Fried Shrimp and Pork Wontons in Chili Oil 10pcs/$8\nWontons were over boiled. The skin was coming off the meat. It came out with peanut sauce (which was not mentioned in the menu). The dish looked unappetizing and it wasn't even spicy.\n\nNoodles with Pork in Fried Bean Paste Sauce $9\n(aka Jajangmyeon) Another item that was misadvertised. I specifically asked the server too if it was and he said YES. This dish had zero black bean sauce flavor. It was basically boiled noodle salad with raw & blanched vegetables. The pork sauce was so minimal that the noodles didn't even change color like usual black bean sauce noodle should.\n\nHomemade Soy Milk $3/glass\nDo not order, $3 for less than 6oz of liquid. Don't waste your money.", "Took the family here for dinner and we all loved it! The marinated tofu, pork & cabbage dumplings, Alley egg noodles and chicken wings were our favorite.

The pan fried pork bun here was solid.\n\nThe dough was very qq, exterior was perfectly pan fried to a golden brown at the bottom, the sesame seeds gave it extra smoky aroma.  The filling was moist but not juicy, flavor was adequate and not too salty at all.  An order contained 6 pieces, each one about 2.5 x 1.5 inch.  \n\nOverall the SJB here is comparable to those of Dumpling Specialist: good dough and perfect exterior but interior lacked juice.

What we had was quesadillas but the corn tortillas were from corn he gets sent from Oaxaca, the meats are tender and marinated perfectly. We also ordered a salad with kale, avocado, hazelnuts, pickled onions and pulled sweet pork, all balanced with a delicately salted dressing. Remember, this is a bar/pub.

The only thing we regret is not ordering full size miso soup for the both of us because that was delicious as well.\n\nI can not wait to order from here again!", "I may have found my new go-to sushi restaurant. Despite living so close to it, I was finally brought to Sushi Tsushima on a date, and I love everything about it! The decor is modern and inviting. Sitting at the sushi bar means omakase only, so we had reservations in the dining room. It's a great date spot because it's intimate and not too loud. We started with the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalape\u00f1o, which was delicious. I'm not a chef but I think it would be even better with some ponzu sauce. We then shared spicy scallop, spicy tuna, and salmon avocado rolls. All the fish was insanely fresh and the rice was served at the perfect temperature and stickiness. Our drinks and service were also great! Overall a fantastic meal... Can't wait to come back and try more.", "Yay.  We got in.  We had a hard time sitting in the Japanese style large table.  Cool idea.  But not easy for older people or people with bad knees.\nFood was delicious.\nThe miso glazed seabass appetizer was wonderful. Crispy edges on light fish cooked just right.  Slightly sweet flash or with just a touch of salty.\nBlack pepper chicken wings were very peppery with fresh ground sea salt grilled until golden  & very crunchy (even better by squeezing the fresh lemon juice over)\nAll of the various sushi were delicious & works of art..", "BEST SUSHI IN MANHATTAN. This place is so underrated, I almost want to gatekeep this, but I also need to share this with y'all. I would call ahead to reserve a table in case, but it usually doesn't get too busy. I've gone here every year for my anniversary dinner / birthday and it's the best bc it's a quiet spot to have an nice dinner. The sushi is so fresh, delicious, and the price is very fair. Friendly and attentive waiters, especially Nitish - he is the best!!", "Really good quality sushi and plenty of selection for the novice and the advance palettes\n\nFor a party of 4, you can book the tatami rooms with a little more privacy and a lot of fun while experiencing the authentic way of enjoying food the Japanese way. In other words, shoes off, cushions, and without chairs. You will find yourself sitting a lot closer to the person sitting immediately next to you. Which in my case I took the advantage to sample multiple dishes and joking through the night with good food and smooth sake.\n\nSome of my personal favorites are:\nSaba Battera (Pressed mackerel sushi)\nNegitoro Roll (Fatty Tuna with scallion)\nTako Ishiyaki (Hot stone octopus)\n\nI could see myself returning with friends from time to time for quality sushi and perhaps trying the other dishes. Did I mention the location is conveniently located near Grand Central?", "Absolutely PHENOMENAL. I'm a sushi hound. My buddy brought me here for dinner one night - it's an absolute diamond in the rough. I'm flabbergasted to see this place doesn't have a 5 star rating across the board. Traditional Japanese decor - everything you want in a REAL sushi place.", "Quaint little sushi spot. Cuts were were generous, and the featured rolls were excellent.

I've been a couple of times over the years and they never fail to disappoint. The chili relleno burger is pretty tasty. Certainly not something I would have imagined putting together, but it works so well. The Al Pastor burger was similarly inventive and tasty. The huge slice of pineapple is just what you need to cut through the rich beef/pork patty. Their mole tots are my idea of comfort food. The tots are nice and crispy which means they stand up to the thick, delicious mole. Even their virgin margarita was top-notch. The Coca-Cola glazed pork belly is a surprisingly light, fresh dish despite the ingredient list. The pork belly is cooked perfectly although admittedly I wouldn't have known it was cooked in Coca-Cola. The arugula, tomatoes, and sweet potato give the dish some much-needed bitterness, sweetness, and earthy notes. I look forward to trying their hatch chili spaghetti and calamari appetizer next time!", "A top notch spot for authentic Mexican cuisine with an American twist on select dishes. Cocktails are also good enough to go to this place for that alone. It's quite loud but a mellow and family friendly atmosphere. Even when it was extremely busy, the service was excellent. I HIGHLY recomend the mole tater tots! I will never forget those for as long as I live! Only complaint is that it's a bit on the pricey side even for the authentic delicious food.", "Stopped by this place on a Friday night after the holidays and such a big mistake. It was so busy and the wait was pretty long but we wanted to try it out. I would definitely suggest getting there early or make a reservation.\n\nWhen finally seated, the waiter gave us some ideas on what to order since it was our first time there. After ordering, the food came out pretty quick. I would say it was like 10-12 minutes top which is great since we were starving.\n\nThe food was pretty good but my poor boyfriend was dying because the food was to spicy for him. We actually asked for all our food non-spicy so not sure what happened there. I enjoyed the food though. The beans were a little spicy but had a great taste. I also enjoyed the rice because that is exactly how I make my rice.\n\nThe manager or maybe the owner came out to introduce himself and welcome us to his place. He brought a complimentary chilaquiles appetizer and it was amazing. Again a little too spicy but delicious. He also asked how we found out about his restaurant and I mentioned Yelp.

It also came with a side of rice and beans which I devoured because despite the simplicity of the two sides- they were not neglected when it came to flavor.\n\nI came here for the Doritos chilaquiles ($12.75) which blew all chilaquiles out of the water. The dish came topped with a sunny side up egg, salsa roja, onion, cilantro, crema, and queso fresco. Bomb. The Doritos gave the dish an extra bite which I really liked.\n\nI love that their menu is innovative, but at the same time retains its authenticity.

This is a very cool place to have drinks, dinner and enjoy some live music and/or dance the night away.  \n\nThe menu offers a great variety of unique snacks, small plates, entrees and seafood.  We began with the Shellfish Tier for 2 which included lobster, oysters, prawns, mussels and clams. The minuet was not great, and they did not offer a traditional cocktail sauce, but I am from Florida and frequently eat oysters.  We shared the wood roasted stuffed pretzel with spicy mustard (yummy), and the wood roasted olives.  The blow away dish was the Pan Roasted Skirt Steak with sweet corn ricotta agnolotti, elotes, chanterelle mushrooms, roasted shishito topped with a chimichurri sauce.  This dish was paired with a local beer. I wish they would consider swapping out the beer for a glass of wine. Nevertheless, the food and service were spot on.

Great service and even better food! A must try!\n\nThis place is right by my house so I had to try it. When we first walked in, we were blown away by the decor. Its dimly light with lots of candles and books and antique knick knacks. Feels very sophisticated. The music selection is also excellent.\n\nOur waitress was very good and accommodating. The service was smooth and professional.\n\nThe food is incredible. Its one of those places where you can tell they thought about the flavors.

I would have never thought to put foie gras in fondue but it elevated it and made it so rich with full umami flavor.\nMy fianc\u00e9 is a picky eater and loved it as well. We also got the stuffed chicken with risotto. The chicken was stuffed with breadcrumbs and had an incredibly crispy and fatty skin. This was perfectly offset by the lemony and creamy risotto.\n\nOur waitress said the juicy Lucy was a popular dish. Its essentially a burger with cheese in the middle with beef fat fries. This was also quiet delicious.\n\nOverall, an amazing culinary experience!", "Made reservations for a Saturday, early afternoon. Surprisingly not busy at all.  Hostess was nice and sat us right away.  The only major complaint is that we waited over 15 minutes for someone to wait on us and that is after I asked the hostess politely to send over a server.  No apology was given.  It was just odd as the place was not busy whatsoever.\n\nCoffee is on point.  Had the Dutch baby, as a starter. Light and fluffy.  I had the board and beer breakfast (2 eggs. Bacon, toast and potatoes). It came with a high life pony.  Ehhh.  I could of done without.  Pretty good.  Sourdough toast was ok.

The black currant Mostarda was tasty (which came on the plate). To explain that small plate of cheese let's say I licked my fingers. My husband ordered the fries and I just about slapped myself. I mean knock them out the park good. I ordered the chicken breast and my husband had the mussels. All tasty and good. My highlight of the night was the Dusek Blizter drink aye yi yi it was so tasty.

I really liked my orecchiette della nonna: the pasta was done perfectly and the pork shoulder sugo was silky and scrumptious. My companion's spaghetti n'duja calabrese was similarly delicious (although a bit gritty, as though the octopus hadn't been rinsed enough). We swabbed our plates clean! A side of kale with chili flakes and garlic was tasty & robust. For dessert, salted caramel budino had good flavor, but had a gelatinous texture which detracted from its appeal for us.

He had little time to spare for us. He took our order and we waited again. We got the octopus, what little there was of it was good. There were three of us and there was barely a piece of octopus each. We also got the prosciutto trio. One of which was deli boiled ham rolled up. We again had to wait to place our main order. We got pasta but only received a half order when we asked for a whole and we also got fish which was so full of bones it was inedible.

I love that you open at 11 a.m. but would love to see more fresh beautiful fish on your menu for lunch.  \nWe ordered two small plates - ahi poke - tasty & plentiful with seaweed salad and just a touch of chili oil around the edges.  Not spicy at all.\nSwordfish Taquittos - not filled with swordfish.  We were both surprised by the spicy fish sausage center.  When I read a menu that says swordfish taquitto - my tummy and mind expect fresh swordfish; not a mixture made into a fish sausage and jalapenos.  The meat was really pink - so I'm not even sure it was swordfish, that when grilled is still white fish.\n\nWhen we told the waitress we were disappointed there was no hassle at all to remove the item from the bill.", "Though I came here purely on the recommendation from a Whisknladle owner, I knew the moment I walked in that I had been here before.  It seemed slightly different, and upon inquiring, I learned the restaurant had indeed been redesigned ages ago, 2008.\n\nIt's easy to find parking in the neighborhood; as for the restaurant, the fresh coat of paint looks great - a modern twist to the old wooden bar type of feel, lighter and cuter in some way, that perhaps due to the time of day.  The marketplace extremely fresh, lacking that distincting fishing town smell despite its culinary nature, indicating with certainty a higher quality here.\n\nAlaskan Cod & Chips 12\nfrench fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce\n\nThere's a distinctly clean taste to the food despite being fried, the fish light but absolutely yummy and substantial, the fries crispy to a good point - not overly so.  They're even sea salted just right.  The coleslaw was noticeably fresh, perhaps tasty even; these qualities really seem to represent the restaurant as a whole.\n\nThe service is as pleasant as the experience, and the restaurant easily makes the list as highly recommendable, simple, and peaceful.  Though the layout and decor may have changed slightly, some things surely haven't - I'm glad.", "The guy behind the fish counter invited me into the restaurant, they have great fresh fish for sale. The next time I'm going to bring my Yeti-Hopper and fill her up with awesome farmer friendly fresh fish.\n\nWhy did it take me so long to find this place, clearly that was my fault. What is so amazing is there is a fish market within the restaurant but no fish smell. I can't make chocolate chip cookies cookies in my house and you not know it but they have a fish market right and you would not know it.  That's technology clean and you need that around sea food.\n\nI had a great meal and some rather good tea. Get there right when they open if you can.  Cheers.", "Dropped in for a late lunch a few days ago after our failed attempt at checking out The Patio for brunch. Possibly a blessing in disguise?! I'll take it.\n\nWe ordered the fried calamari, a great serving to share and wasn't overcooked nor sitting in a bed of oil. I thoroughly enjoyed the seared ahi tostada, with generous slices of seared ahi tuna and avocado on two pieces of crispy corn tortillas. The garlic aioli dressing paired really well with the tuna, something I've never tried before.\n\nIt does smell fishy in here upon entrance (cheers from Captain Obvious), reminiscent of my favorite El Pescador near downtown La Jolla. There's plenty of seating, which is great for larger parties and the hard wood d\u00e9cor and high ceilings are a plus, especially on a hot summer day. The service was good and we received our entrees in a timely manner. Situated in north PB, this is definitely a nice change from normal hustle and bustle of Pacific Beach, with decent parking to boot!", "My two friends and I have eaten here many times over the last five years. Lunches, mostly , not too many dinners. I like to return to places I get good service and good food consistently. Who doesn't ? My choice for a belated birthday lunch Saturday around noon. The place was kinda quiet for a beach Saturday in mid July. Service was very slow , kitchen was not moving very fast either , ya' know we are hungry ! Couldn't get a refill on my iced tea from our server nor the busboy who didn't show up at all until it was time to clear the dishes from the table ! Then to top it off , my two friends ordered a surprise birthday desert while I was buying food to go from the fish counter , and they must have had to go to La Jolla , in beach traffic , to the Baskins Robbins to procure it ! I don't think I'm going back anytime soon. Your loss Fishery , work on it !", "Open, airy and inviting, great food and good service this restaurant has all the ingredients for a nice dining experience.\n\nOur trip here was for a late lunch. There was plenty of seating and parking. We chose to sit outside on a January afternoon and were offered heat lamp to be turned on. Our visit started and finished well with excellent customer service. The food choices were influenced perfectly as we asked the preverbal \"What's good\"? question.\n\nWe chose and absolutely loved the; Clam Chowder (very good, full of goodies) the steamed clams, cooked nicely in a great broth with bread and finally  the Mr Brown's tacos, comes with two, rice and beans and was light and packed with flavor.\n\nThe entire dining experience was most likely influenced by great weather, easy parking, choice of seating but at its core is really good food, a wonderful ambience and excellent service.

We've been three times in a month and feel motivated to let others know how much we dig it.\n\nPros:\n+ true taste of NOLA\n+ the French bread on the poboy is arguably better than the cherished leidenheimer bread local only to New Orleans (don't tell anyone I said that though)\n+ shrimp remoulade\n+ red beans and rice\n+ gumbo z'herbs\n+ decor and vibe is authentic\n+ they play saints games\n+ service. attentive, friendly, professional, casual.\n\nCons:\n- a pet peeve: madi gras beads outside of carnival? c'mon, chef. you're better than that.\n- salt level on oyster poboy is over the top. I suspect using crystal hot sauce + salt. Pick one.\n- $16 red beans. To be fair, it's appropriately named Rich Man's Red Beans and I'll order it again because it's amazing. But, damn, that's a margin that flirts with insult.\n\nIn summary: we love it and think you might too.", "The Bywater is a casual restaurant owned by the same chef-owner David Kinch of Manresa, which was recently awarded its third Michelin star. They serve Creole dishes.\n\nWe arrived at 11:30 am on a Friday and was told there would be a 45 minute wait. Fortunately, there was a Safeway to run some errands next door. When our table was ready, the restaurant kindly gave us a call.\n\nWe ordered 2 entrees and a dessert. The entrees came out quickly. They were very flavorful and tasty. Just what I like: food with a big punch of intense flavor. Prices were very good for the quality too; about $11 a dish. Dessert was beignets. I was disappointed with the beignets (thought they tasted bland).\n\nOverall I think this would make a nice lunch spot with friends on a weekday. I would not recommend dinner, as the portions are on the smaller side. Arrive early to avoid wait. Park behind the restaurant and not out in the front. The menu is limited, and I hope they will introduce more new dishes in the future.", "I wanted to like this place so badly, but after two disappointing visits I have concluded it's just okay. Having lived in Louisiana for 4 years I can confidently say that this does not taste like Cajun food. It tastes more like someone went to Louisiana once, liked the food, and tried to recreate it from memory. The food is fine, but nothing special. The po boys don't even come dressed with the basic ingredients that make a po boy a po boy! No tomato or pickles, and I couldn't tell if it had mayo or not.\n\nThe cocktails are good, but once again inauthentic. Anyone who has had a hurricane at pat o's and tries the one here would be confused as to how it's considered a hurricane.\n\nThe most authentic thing is the atmosphere and design inside. Looks-wise, you do feel like you walked into a restaurant in New Orleans when you're in there. Price-wise not so much.\n\nIf you're looking for an overpriced, southern inspired experience, and a good drink this is the place for you. But if you want a real Cajun meal, you'll have to look further.", "My understanding is that David Kinch wanted to create an homage to New Orleans with Bywater. The place where he learned about food and learned about cooking.  I have had the good fortune to have experienced K-Paul's when Chef Paul Prudhomme helmed the kitchen and his wife ran the front of the house; Commander's Palace under Tory McPhail; Windsor Court's, The Grill Room under Jeff Tunks; Antoine's; Galatoires; etc.  I can only say that, after dining at Bywater, Mr. Kinch's memories or experiences concerning Creole/Cajun cuisine and it's preparation are vastly different than mine.  The cuisine of New Orlean's is vibrant, intoxicating, boisterous, and makes a statement.  Mr. Kinch's iterations are bland, stingy in serving, over-priced and not representative of New Orleans glorious food history.  Case in point: The last thing a gumbo should be is soupy it should have a viscous consistency created by a patiently, deliberately made roux.  Bywater's gumbo is a bland, soupy, concoction, miserly portioned, bereft of character and lacking in substance, served with cracked, overcooked rice!  The shrimp and avocado remoulade immediately shocks the diner not for its appetite-whetting appeal but by the sheer parsimony of the serving compared to the price.  Bywater needs work before les bons temps rouler!", "I stopped in here on the way to Santa Cruz because I was really excited to get some authentic NOLA style food. Based on all the other great reviews, it must have been an off day. The red beans and rice had a very pungent vinegar-ish taste which is nothing like the rich and smokey flavor I've had in NOLA. Also, the beans themselves were very hard and seemed quite undercooked. Their twist on gumbo was pretty good, although I was hoping to have a more traditional gumbo. For dessert, the filling of the chocolate pecan chess pie was tasty, but the crust was awful. It was waxy and hard and I could barely cut through it. Thank goodness I only paid happy hour prices for the red beans and rice and gumbo. On the positive side, I loved the atmosphere and decor and my sazerac was good.", "Came here to try the famous bread the other day and was not let down! the parking is really small in the back, but consequently,e veryone misses it and it's almost always empty.

The jackfruit tacos were my least favorite but the black beans and veggies that came wish were delicious.\n\nCocktails were largely tequila and mezcal based.

I had to go with the fried chicken sandwich and again curious how it would be cooked. Pleasantly surprised to find a monstrous stacked meal that made me curious as to how to get my mouth around it (I opted to remove one slice of fried chicken), and loved the combination of quality fowl with pickles and sauce. I was also impressed by their wine list and enjoyed a nice Oregon Pinot (check out their wine shop next door). Okay foodies this is a destination!", "Lovely meal! I had seen Alta in EaterLA and it was listed as a black-owned business in Yelp so I wanted to give it a try. We did parking on the street around the corner and had a table for 2. We both got the fried chicken sandwich which was perfect. I am not a fan when fried chicken is too greasy but this was crispy without being too greasy. On the menu it said there's spicy Mayo for this sandwich but I actually didn't think it was too spicy (which is good for me since I don't love spicy food but not sure about how ppl who like  it hot would feel). The bun is a brioche I believe, making it solid sandwich bread.\nI love the patio! Having that overhead of all green and the ambiance of r&b overall made for a cool relaxing vibe.\nThe servers were so kind and made sure we were accounted for.

I visited the restaurant on Father's Day with my family for brunch. Their gorgeous patio is now open for food service. There are a few tables on the patio that allow for an intimate dining experience, while socially distancing as well. We had the BBQ Sandwich and Pickles with smoked chicken. Simple sandwich with a lot of great flavor. The chicken was tender and juicy and slathered with a tangy bbq sauce. Next up, the Steak and Eggs showcased tender steak seasoned to perfection with a side of crispy fried potatoes and eggs prepared how you want them. We also ordered the Biscuits and Honey Butter which was a buttery biscuit complimented with a mellow and sweet honey flavor. To wash it down, a delicious cocktail called a \"Berry Bomb\". It was a refreshing mix of fresh blackberries and strawberries with gin and soda. Overall the service was great. Friendly servers that were professional and attentive. I highly recommend this place for its food and ambiance.", "Their food is delicious! Had dinner with a group of 6. We had drinks, appetizers, main entrees & dessert.

Presentation was perfect, and I trusted my waiter to select my wine for me - which was a perfect selection.  My children enjoyed dishes that generally do not excite young appetites.  They ate so much of our p\u00e2t\u00e9 appetizer, that little was left for the adults.  I even tried to stop them from eating it all by telling them how it's made, but that did not stop them.

They're so good, you might want to pass on having to share these flavor pillows.\n\nFor the ramen, I ordered the Spicy Roasted Garlic Miso ($14), which was honestly everything I had hoped for. It came out surprisingly quick too! The rich broth was super flavorful and the spice level was just right. The egg noodles were really chewy and had that good, slightly tougher texture I look for in ramen.

The mahi mahi with huitlacoche was also amazing.  The huitlacoche is earthy and just an awesome mushroom sauce.  The mole dishes we tried were the best I've ever eaten.  The chicken is perhaps a tad overcooked but the pepian rojo and oaxacaeno moles was smoky and rich, but edible in large large quantities.", "Had this place on my list of restaurants I wanted to try. We had breakfast and it was so good. I had the chilaquiles with mole (Oaxaque\u00f1o). We also tried the empanadas and Chilate (soup). The Chilate was good; I recommend if you love spicy food. Overall, a great place to eat. Will come back to try their other moles.", "If you like mole and you like to enjoy a different type of food... this is the place to eat. It's a very small place.

Some highlights included the seaweed bread, Icelandic cod with caviar cream, and the duck a l'orange. The seaweed bread was unique, light, and earthy.\n\nThe more noticeable factor was the service. The bread service was randomly paced and inconsistent with other diners. Dishes were placed to the wrong people.

Mostly a soggy roll and sadly not worth the calories/cholesterol.\n\nThe Fish Milanese offset the Pambazo, largely by virtue of the cucumber, cilantro and jalape\u00f1o-based salad.  \n\nWe'd considered ordering additional dishes but were not impressed enough to do so.  \n\nThe tequila and mezcal selections were broad.  However, the beer list was limited to 3, one of which was not Mexican.  Mexico produces some excellent beer, so?\n\nThe space (white and black) was unremarkable, apart from its location on the north facing corner that the restaurant occupies which brightens the dining room and keeps the outdoor tables from being blinded by afternoon sun.  One rest room (i.e., 1 toilet) translated into a long wait.  \n\nPerhaps it was an \"off\" afternoon, but afraid we are not inclined to return.", "I really wish this place had happy hour bc I'd be coming here weekly for their espresso martini. I know everyone raves about the margaritas and they were also good (especially the spicy one) but the mezcal espresso martini might just be my favorite drink in the city right now.\n\nFood wise everything was solid, the only thing that blew me away was the mushrooms. They were so tender and crispy and perfectly paired with the acidic salsa verde. Those mushrooms on a taco would be killer. For dessert, even though the churros looked impressive, I was a bigger fan of the Tres Leches Cake which had a such a subtle sweetness to it. It left me going back for more bites than I thought I would.\n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get more love from me is the $$$. The starting price for drinks is $17 and while that fits in with other restaurants in this location, I just don't think it's fully justified.

The staff and service were ah-maz-ing, going above and beyond on everything.\n\nBut the best part is obviously the food. Everything was really delicious and unexpected. Some plates are small, so it's best to ask your server how many plates per person would be a good meal. My friend and I just ordered a few things and shared, and left totally satisfied with a very reasonable bill.\n\nWe had:\n- The Margaritas: A+, for flavor and strength ;)\n- The Guacamole: A++, for flavor and presentation (they'll give you more chips if you ask, btw)\n- The Artic Char Tostada: A+, for flavor and inventiveness\n- The Enchiladas Divorciadas: A++++, would eat for the rest of my days\n- The Mushroom Quesadilla: a solid B+, yummy but not quite as captivating\n- Corn Tamal desert: A++++, no other desert will ever be this good\n- Fresas y Crema: A, for flavor and inventiveness (and a very unique texture)\n\nBasically, go. Plan a night of it. Indulge and share.", "Huge fan of Atla. Recently came here for the first time and will definitely be back. I was hesitant to dine here due to so many negative reviews about the service but I thought the service was great.\n\nThe spicy margs may be some of the best I've ever had and the Oaxacan Coffee was devine. The food is expensive, yes, but it is sooo good. We had Brussel Sprouts, Guacamole, Beef Birria (1/2 lb), Pork Al Pastor Gringa, and a side order of tortillas. We loved everything and it was the perfect amount to share.\n\nThe only negative is how small the tables for two are. Since this a share style menu, it was difficult to fit all of the food on the table. But other than that, the food, drinks and service are great. Would recommend coming here with friends or on a date.", "So hip the restaurant is barely the point. Reading the drinks menu you could easily miss the food section, but it's there. And there's a fine Mexican kitchen lurking in the back. We had the pork taco, the flautas, the fish/cucumber/tortillas thing and the torta. It was all very tasty and fresh.

The lamb was different and divine! Highly highly recommend The spice in the lamb itself, combined with the tartness of the saffron yogurt and then crunchy dill rice was magical!

The service was good, and well, the restaurant decor is quite well known.\n\nThe buns are almost as good as hyped. Very fatty and rich, you gotta eat them with some of their hot sauce. Nevertheless, while I did like them, I have to give the overall best buns award to Ippudo (Sorry David Chang).\n\nThe ramen is unique in that it doesn't taste like traditional japanese ramen, BUT the serving size is much larger than what you would find at a traditional japanese style place (Ippudo). The broth is much smokier and has a heavy pork flavor. I enjoyed it, but I didn't dig it.

My boyfriend ordered the tamales, which he loved.\n\nThe thing to order is definitely the table side guac made fresh. I also enjoyed the trio of salsas that were served with the chips - not many places give you any variety, it's usually just one salsa, and it always seems to be too spicy and hot for me!\n\nThe food is average - not the best mexcian, but pretty good.

There was a thick layer of \"spicy\" sausage and a generous amount of cheese.

The crust is very buttery and almost flakey (pie like). I would definitely order again. The medium pie has 6 slices. 2 slices would fill the average person, especially when combined with some of the great beers you can get locally.\n\nThe only negatives (which are likely similar to other deep dish pizza places) include the time it takes to cook (45-60min) and the price ($25-30).\n\nOverall, you definitely need to try Gino's East. The location is convenient and the original location looks like a nice place to enjoy a slice or two.", "i guess Chicago deep dish pizza is not for everyone, and I am one of them.  My first at trying the classic dish on a visit tot he Windy City, it was a bit of a disappointment. It is a good idea to call ahead as a pizza does take 45 minutes to bake.  I went to the downtown location which had a 45 minute to just to get a seat. The interior is dark and graffiti-strewn, which personally I found made the place look dumpy and not worth the wait just to eat inside. Pick it up and take it back to your home or hotel.\n\nAs for the pizza, I ordered a small supreme, which is $24!  It's thick and enough for two persons if they are not super hungry.  Toppings were good, but the crust was a underbaked corn meal concoction and made up 1/3 of the thickness.  The cheese is plentiful but will congeal back into the mozzarella stick consistency as it cools, so eat fast. As an alternative for a few dollars more you can have lunch for two on the 95th floor of the Hancock building (with that kick-butt view).", "Upon arriving in Chicago my GF and I talked about finding the best deep dish pizza in town.  Many people recommended to try out Giordano's, but I've had it before and it was ok (bought a frozen one and cooked it at home).  We decided to go against popular opinion and try out Gino's East.  The wait wasn't long at all, even for a Friday.  The decorations are neat with graffiti art throughout displayed across the entire restaurant.  We ordered their cheesy bread appetizer, and it just seemed like a big buttery mess.  We would have been better off not ordering it.  The pizza that we ordered was the Meaty Legend.  A combination of pepperoni, italian sausage, canadian bacon, and bacon.  It was something to remember.  I've never had SO much high quality meat in a pizza.  All in all, we were satisfied with picking Gino's East over Giordano's.  It would have received an additional star in their rating, but the appetizer brought it down a notch.", "Every time I head to Chicago for business or pleasure I make sure to hit this place up. My last visit was the same as the first four time, fantastic. The prices might be a little high for traditional pizza but certainly not for this delicious deep dish. The meat lovers or Chicago fire are my favorite. This last time we got sausage and it appeared as though they had covered the entire pizza in a layer on sausage...not a nibble here and a nibble there...eat and every bite had meat it in.\nIf you go be sure to bring a white out pen, the walls are covered in graffiti but the walls are black so if you are planning on seeing anything you want to write it should be in white. This time around I was able to find the message by fianc\u00e9e and I left a year ago. I only had to interrupt a cute couple on a date for one second while I got in the booth with them to find it.\nPS if you want a quick bite to eat and don't want to wait the 40 minutes for your pizza I also highly recommend the honey wings...amazing.", "Gino's was amazing! We came on a Thursday afternoon at about 2 with 10 people. We had a 2 minute wait while they put tables together. Some of our group got drinks and they said they were good! We ordered the breadsticks and Brussel sprouts as appetizers and both were delicious. We got three medium pizzas for the 10 of us to share and it was more than enough. The Italian Chi was great and had a sweet and spicy taste. The Meaty one was also just as delicious. Be prepared to wait for 45-60 minutes for this delicious deep dish pizza though!", "came here with a large group-someone in the group had ordered a mix of pies before we arrived so I had no input on the selection. In addition to the deep dish pies, he ordered a few thin crust pies (NYers can't help doubting deep dish). DO NOT order thin crust pies here-they tasted frozen-sauce was terrible and crust was like cardboard. This place is known for deep dish--don't deviate!!!", "Be prepared to wait for your food. Once the pizza gets there it is piping hot and delicious.  I recommend the fire house pizza.

Chef Stefano De Lorenzo is doing some wonderful things with pasta here -- and he is front and center to answer your questions and offer his recommendations on what to order.  We had:\n\n1. Beef Ragu Lasagna 5/5 - perfect sized portion for one, this was light and not overly \"red-sauced\" but had a layered, delicate touch to it.\n\n2. The much talked about Beet Ravioli w/ Brown Butter sauce did not disappoint -- I see why many reviewers (and the LA Times) love this dish.\nLight, pillowy pasta with sweet red beets inside. 5/5\n\nThey now have their beer and wine license and I highly recommend the Italian Beer they have by the bottle -- a nice change from the usual suspects Peroni and Moretti.\n\nThey don't take reservations but we got in right away on a recent Saturday evening around 6:30 -- it's a small, quiet restaurant, and despite what I read in several reviews here -- the food came out quickly and the service was excellent. I think we've found our new \"go-to\" neighborhood Italian as with these VERY reasonable prices it's the type of place you can come once a week and even fit in a lunch or two.  Bravo!", "Prior to the onset of pandemic, I went to this place a few times and it was superb back then. So, my wife and I decided to go there on the weekend and took our 1.5 year old who loves pasta. It was a total disappointment. First, it took us 1 hour and 5 minutes to get food at the table from the moment we sat down. Mind the fact that they brought an exact dish we ordered to the table next to us who got seated 30 minutes later and our toddler was greedily looking at the neighboring table asking for food (sad scene). This could all be redeemed by the good food we were all so much looking forward to for over an hour, but that was unfortunately not the case. Out of 5 dishes we ordered, 3 were significantly over salted and one of them had a salt gradient as a function of a dish depth. The only good dish was their beet ravioli, whereas the rest were very unsatisfying. Overall, the combination of poor and slow service and a subpar quality pasta make it a no go for us in the future.", "Went here for lunch on a co-workers recommendation. I wasn't expecting much as the establishment itself looks very inconspicuous. There wasn't even any signage outside so I passed it by a few times before I found it. By the way it's right across the street from the old post office for those of you who may have the same issue as I did. Now, the food- be forewarned, the portions aren't very big, but man oh man are they packed with flavor! I got the red beet ravioli dish, and was one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. My coworker ordered the lasagna, which was tasty as well, albeit not as delicious as my ravioli. I also ordered their corn soup- which I promptly finished and then picked up the bowl to slurp whatever last bit was remaining, so yummy.\nI was so impressed with the dishes that we had I want to come back to try out the other ones. The menu is very simple so I figure I will be able to try everything within a few visits. If everything continues to be as good as my first visit, I'm sure I won't be disappointed!", "I read about Colapasta in an article and excitingly made time in probably the busiest weekend ever to come and try it. I am so happy I did!\n\nCame around 12pm and actually quite easily found meter parking a few blocks down from the restaurant. Walked in and was greeted by the sweetest staff in a casual cute restaurant. Beautiful decor.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the lasagna, the calamarata, and the casunziei beet ravioli to share. All three were incredible and definitely must have dishes. Everything was so fresh and the restaurant prides itself on using fresh local ingredients. I don't even like beets but I loved the beet ravioli.\n\nThe olive oil they use is clearly high quality, and I would have loved to have bread to scoop up the remaining sauce from each of the dishes!\n\nWe honestly were sad when we finished our food and so tempted to order another pasta or burrata!

Carmel has around 80 restaurants in the Golden Triangle, which makes up a about one square mile. That's a lot of dining choices and I feel a large majority of them are Italian. Cultura is a dinner only option and is tucked back in an inviting courtyard. We started with a pitcher of their classic margaritas and Queso Fundido. The queso is a take it or leave it item for me. When coming here I would never \"leave it\" now! Cheese, red peppers, poblano peppers, shallots served with homemade corn tortillas. Scrap the bowl good!! My husband had Chicken Enchiladas for his entree. Non traditional, served in a ceramic crock, with cheese, tomatillo salsa and black bean pur\u00e9e. Tasty and a large portion. I ordered the Cultura Mole. In my opinion this is the dish to order. Smoked pork, orange segments with pickled vegetables, cabbage and sesame nestled on the plate. Served in a steaming iron container with a lid. It was so good, mole not strong tasting as some can be. Ready to have it again today! I heard several people mention they were told to eat here and I totally agree. EAT at CULTURA", "This place is a wonderful hidden gem! We came in on a Saturday night and sat in the lively mezcal room. Great place to sit if you're ok with a little noise and want a more festive environment. To start, we had the oysters, which were a little spicy and acidic and delicious. Then, we split the chicken enchiladas and mole pork. Highly, highly recommend trying the pork. The mole sauce is rich and delicious, and they provide awesome homemade tortillas and pickled vegetables to assemble your own tacos. Cute touch at the end of your meal--you're served a mini hot chocolate as a parting gift from the restaurant. Only 4/5 stars because it took a little bit of time to get our drinks after our apps were served, but otherwise super friendly service!", "Overall, I was happy with my experience at Cultura. I expected it to be pricey, but I think the meal we had was worth the cost (for the most part). We enjoyed and would recommend the Halibut Ceviche and the Cultura Mole. The mole was especially delicious with the freshly made tortillas and it was a good portion size for 2-3 people to share. We were disappointed in the total lack of flavor of the Watermelon Heirloom Tomato Salad...no salt, no dressing, and no citrus. The street tacos weren't bad...the meats and salsa we're tasty, but the slaw on top seemed like a grocery store bag mix. They would probably be better off making the street tacos a bit more authentic by doing away with the cabbage slaw and just serving them with meat, salsa, onions, and cilantro. Lastly, our cocktails were fabulous. We ordered El Primero and the Pina Aplastada. Both are highly recommended if you like the smokey flavor of Mezcal.\n\nCustomer Service: 10/10\n\nAmbiance: 7/10 (Nice decor, but no air conditioning on a 90 degree evening!)\n\nTaste: 8/10\n\nOverall experience: 8/10", "Cultura has a very unique and casual dining experience. It is a beautiful and intimate restaurant located inside a courtyard in the wonderful Carmel by the Sea. The food was unbelievably fantastic and is inspired by the food and mezcal of Oaxaca.\n\nWe started with margaritas and chips with roasted tomato salsa, Tomatillo salsa verde and guacamole. We then ordered the Queso Fundido to go along with the chips which also came with flour tortillas. The Queso Fundido has Monterey Jack cheese with pablano peppers, red peppers, shallot, corn, crema and quesillo. The drinks, chips and all the dips were amazing and so fresh.\n\nFor our meal we ordered the Nachos Locos and two street tacos, chicken and carne asada. The Nachos Locos was loaded with black beans, crema, guacamole, tomatillo, Guajillo and Monterey Jack cheese. Again, everything was so fresh and delicious, we were super full but kept eating because it was so good. As full as we were we had to try the homemade churros and chocolate fondue with added coconut.

But the food itself is among some of the very best I've tried in LA. Subtle, beautiful flavor combinations, masterfully prepared. The food is innovative and modern, while still being solidly Spanish. Bravo! One gripe is that the wine list leaned way too sweet and fruity for my taste. If you're an old world European wine fan, you will be s**t out of luck.

Nice mixed crowd too.\nThe happy hour was great. $5 beers and some tasty $8 cocktails. The Hotel Parador and Rioja Sour are my faves. The tapas are so good. The pan con tomate (toasted bread tomato and olive oil) is so simple and delicious. I could probably eat a whole plate of just that. The Croqueta de jamon is addicting cheesy goodness. Also loved the shishito peppers. Had to satisfy my sweettooth in the end with the churros y chocolate. Service was great, the bartenders were fast and friendly and gave great recommendations.

And yet, none of this comes as a surprise as the chef has showcased his talents for years and been the recipient of much acclaim in the city. His skillfully made, vegetable-centric American fare served here is unique and spirited, beginning with caramelized cauliflower served with chilies and Meyer lemon jam. Market-driven salads dominate the lunch menu, while the wood-oven pizzas, made with house-milled whole wheat flour, are a hit at any time.The generously sized room is uncluttered and mid-century chic, with bright orange window frames and boldly striped banquettes.", "yelp_reviews": ["Stumbled upon this place late on a Tuesday. Luckily, we didn't need a reservation and were given an option of tables (standard/high-top/bar). We opted for the high-top tables and were ushered into a room with a bar. Loring Place is classy and elegant with a modern, fresh feel.\n\nWhen we first arrived, our waiter was busy with his many tables, but once the rush died down he was very attentive and helpful throughout the meal. We opted to try a few glasses of wine and a number of dishes from their seasonal menu that showcases fresh ingredients. We tried the baked ricotta, crispy spiced cauliflower, roasted carrots, and the grandma style pan pizza. The baked ricotta was AMAZING. It was served with crispy buttered sourdough toast and had surprise notes of ramps, fava beans and pistachio pesto. I would definitely recommend for an appetizer. The cauliflower was also interesting, the spice with chilies and meyer lemon jam along with the crunchy texture of the frying worked really well.\n\nOverall, I had a really lovely experience here. The ambience, service, and food were excellent. This restaurant is good for both groups and dates. Can't wait to go back!", "Phenomenal. Had the pleasure of dining here with my girlfriend on its 10th open day...I believe the NYT was there too, how exciting! Congrats to Chef Dan Kluger for putting together such a new and exciting restaurant (and my friend Chef Karen Shu, both are two amazing chefs). Thanks for the amazing Anniversary experience Chef Karen :)\n\nWe skipped large plates as a place like this is known for its vegetables. We ordered the house made whole wheat bread, baked ricotta, butternut fries, and crispy spiced cauliflower. We were also sent the grain salad (my favorite...half of the grains were pan fried, nice simply technique making the dish unique), hummus and radishes, and the leeks and pears.\n\nThe service was wonderful too. Extensive Champagne list, three by the glass and 17 bottlew. Cocktail menu is pretty unique too, we had the stable and thoroughfare, both delicious. Desserts were awesome too, though we only had room to order one and were sent one extra, the vanilla ice cream blizzard and cashew chocolate bar, both job well done.\n\nWe will be returning without a doubt!", "Where the food should have been the star of the show, it simply wasn't very memorable. After leaving ABC Kitchen, Chef Dan Kluger opened his first restaurant, with a menu that was very similar in feel. Elements of American fare, elements of Italian, and plenty of veggies at the center. Only these components didn't fuse together as they do more organically at ABC. We left having been lost in a fog of underwhelming veggie preparations, pastas with flavors that just didn't seem to work, and a pizza that ticked all the wrong boxes.\n\nMany diners may come and go, paying less attention to the food, and fulfilled (or fooled) by the upscale ambiance and trendy vibe of this Greenwich village hangout. But if you're out to dine with food as your focus, you'll be easily disappointed by the disconnectedness of this menu and dining experience.", "A classic American restaurant. The menu has a very similar vibe to ABC kitchen. I've been twice and enjoyed the food both times!\n\nThe service is so-so. It gets very crowded and it seems like the staff doesn't yet have a handle on how to manage it. For one of my reservations, I waited 20+ minutes even with a reservation.\n\nI love that they offer wine on tap. Such an affordable option, call me cheap IDC. Food rundown:\n\nHousemade bread: DIVINE. It is served warm with butter and is truly amazing. Ask for a side of salt. The bread is a good size for 2 people, so if you are a larger party, get more!\n\nBeets: A nice surprise! Served cold but delish. On the larger side for appetizers.\n\nBass: Good but not great. I was trying to be healthy so getting it served that, but the way it is prepared over sauces makes it a bit ~soggy~\n\nShortrib: YUM! The meat melts in your mouth. Highly recommended. The portion is small so this is definitely not a dish to share.", "This is one of the few places that I have on repeat in the city and jump on any open resy. My favs are definitely the baked ricotta- yes, the cheese is delicious but the tomatoes baked within are amazing. Also highly recommend the cavatelli- perfectly cooked duck in a very tasty red sauce. Topped off dinner with salted caramel ice cream which you won't regret. Service was efficient, friendly, and knowledgeable and the chef is so talented it keeps this place on my go-to list.", "Me before dinner: What did you say? ABC Kitchen's Dan Kluger opened a new place? Yes, yes, yes!!!! Let's go. Now, now, NOW!!!\n\nMe after dinner: Conflicted. While there were some hits and Chef crushes veggie forward dishes like nobody else in town, there were too many disappointing dishes to fulfill my excitement.\n\nI was blown away by the baked ricotta with roasted kabocha (which had a perfect amount of heat) and the fluke crudo served with crisped rice.\n\nUnfortunately, the broccoli salad was a huge disappointment as it was swimming in a mayonnaise-like sauce. And while the vanilla blizzard tasted great, $12 for a scoop of vanilla ice cream with some toppings was bothersome...especially with Big Gay Ice Cream being only a few blocks away.\n\nI will definitely give Loring Place another try at some point, but unfortunately I am not clamoring to return like I was after the first time I eat chef Kluger's food at ABC Kitchen years ago.", "Excellent meal with some pastas and ALL pizzas made with whole wheat flour (this is part of the VERY healthy Mediterranean diet--which is a huge plus). The salads are extremely well-prepared and good-portion size. The service is very attentive and helpful. This restaurant is a welcome addition to my roster of places to recommend.

The interior has a New Orleans vibe from the decor to the Jazz music both live and radio. Very upbeat and fun.\n     Wait staff were friendly and welcoming. Our server Cassandra was personable and knowledgeable.\n     We started our meal with some hush puppies, gumbo packed with andouille sausage, shrimp, crawfish and pulled chicken and Carr-Grilled Oysters topped with butter, parmigiana breadcrumbs.\n    Gumbo was hardy and flavorful with just the right amount of spice.\n    The oysters also had good taste but was still attached to the shell and made it hard to eat.\n    Glenda and I both had  po'boys Glenda had the Nashville fried chicken which was huge, battered nicely and seasoned well. I elected for the oyster po'boy also tasty with a good amount of seasoned well battered oysters.\n    We ended our meal with a Nw Orleans staple beignets. A little dense, but good size.\n    We recommend this restaurant for a good meal and a good time. Try it out and let me know what you think. I give it 4 stars.\n    Ciao Ciao for now.", "Ina Mae is the brainchild of Frontier's executive chef, Brian Jupiter. Everything he touches (and cooks) is gold. If I recall, Chef Jup is from The Big Easy, so this restaurant is a throwback to his upbringings in Creole and Cajun food.\n\nI went the first week they opened and almost tried everything. My palette was craving pretty traditional \"N'awlens\" fair, and I tend to stick to things I loved from when I go to N.O.\n\nRecommendations:\nPo' Boys (oyster)\nGumbo ya-ya\nFried Green Tomatoes\nCrispy potatoes (essential side)\nAlligator sausage\nDirty rice\n\nCocktails and beverage menu rocks, and I am certainly going to come back to try their brunch and chargrilled oysters. Certainly a great spot just for a drink!", "NolaXCHI!!!! It's such a neat neighborhood spot. Nothing pretentious but the staff made us feel important and well taken care of. I almost forgot there was a bar behind us. The bar scene didn't overload the space. My family and I ordered Mae's honey chicken, the fried green tomato po' boy, and the seafood tower with sides of dirty rice. All of it was delicious, and that's an understatement. Each dish came out as it was ready and was plated to share. We didn't mind that at all. We could taste the authenticity of the dirty rice. The fried green tomatoes reminded me of my granny's (she's from the Delta). A piece of honey fried chicken paired with the rice was perfect for my 5 year old. The seafood tower had all the favorites: oysters, crawfish, catfish, shrimp, hush puppies and red potatoes. The spicy aioli was an added bonus. Despite everything being fried, we didn't leave feeling heavy and lethargic. Most of the food was boxed up for left overs! We enjoyed our Saturday afternoon at Ina Mae's and will be back soon.", "Staff was friendly and very accommodating but the food...the only thing you could taste was salt. Went for the Reveille Dinner. The menu sounded so good gumbo, New Orleans style bbq shrimp, artichoke and blue crab lasagna for dessert butter pecan bread pudding. How could you go wrong right? No holy trinity flavors no garlic flavors no Cayenne pepper or any spice for that matter just salt only salt even the dessert was salty. Really wish they would have utilized other spices like any other spices. I love New Orleans food and really was looking forward to making this place my new spot, guess I just have to catch a flight and go to New Orleans to get the flavors I so desperately miss.", "Wicker Park places has fallen off my radar for their overpriced, frat environment.  So I took a chance on Ina and pleasantly surprised.     The music is awesome (more 70s/80s) and the decor is simple but functional.   It a New Orleans style place with all the staples- char grilled oysters, po boys, gumbo and snow balls.    This is my second visit and absolutely in love with the oysters and cajun elotes.  Abita beer in a bottle makes me think of Jackson Square on a  humid NOLA day.  I have sat at the bar twice and service is a bit spotty but not something that would make me decide to not go back.   Will be trying the  brunch next.   For a little flavor of cerole soul in the midwest, this is my best bet so far.", "Came here for brunch on a Saturday and ordered a Frozen Basic Peach and Fried Chicken & Pancakes! The frozen basic peach was pretty tasty & sweet - refreshing for a hot summer day! The fried chicken & pancakes were definitely the star of the show though, especially the pancakes!!! They were nice and crispy on the edge, but fluffy inside. They're salted praline pancakes, so the praline also added some nice texture! Chicken & waffles is a classic, but I might like chicken & pancakes more now. I liked the texture contrast between the crispy fried chicken and the fluffy pancakes!\n\nMy friends tried a few other dishes like the po'boys and the grand slam breakfast.

Whether you choose a cocktail and a mushroom-squash blossom quesadilla at the bar or bowls of chips and queso fundido with a big group on the sunny back patio, good times are guaranteed.", "yelp_reviews": ["I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious food and drink were here.

We opted to sit at the bar, and had great service from all the staff.  \n\nStarted with a Big Jimmy cocktail (Gin, honey, lemon, bitters, ginger), and it did not disappoint!  It's right up with my favorite Marin cocktail.  The margarita was one of the best Mr B had imbibed in a long time.\n\nFor food we got al pastor (pork) tacos and chicken flautas.  Impressed with the quality and taste of the food.  There was a brightness to both, as they both included small bits of pineapple, which elevated the dishes.  Did note a large piece of uncooked pork (fat? skin?) that was unsettling.  \n\nPrice point is on the higher side for the portion size of food, and for cocktails.   I found it pretty cheap of Playa to charge $5 for chips and salsa.  Subtract a star for that.", "I waited nearly 7 months before trying Playa because I heard so many mixed reviews regarding both the food and cocktails.  I'm glad I waited because in my opinion they've worked out the kinks and perfected their dishes!  The Margaritas were delicious and their selection of Margaritas and tequila are excellent.  The guacamole is truly the best I've ever tasted and the chips that came with it were fresh, light and warm!  The Queso Fundido with Chorizo appetizer is rich but very, very delicious! My only complaint is the plates are rather small so count on ordering two (per person) if you're hungry as the plates are really more tapas style in size.  Note: They do have a large plate selection ranging from $28 to $39, but we all passed on that since we enjoyed more of a variety of the smaller dishes.  We were a group of four and we all ordered different dishes from the menu.  The wood grilled calamari was delicious!  The Crab Quesadilla special was delicious. The sauces for the Quesadillas and Tamales were very heavy handed thus overwhelming the flavors of the inside ingredients therefore I'd recommend getting your sauces on the side.  Everyone at our table walked out very content and we all gave it a thumbs up!   Highly recommended!", "What an upgrade for Mill Valley -authentic Mexican with a modern vibe!\nWe love Joe's Taco Lounge and Grilly's but this is a whole different deal. The decor, service and amazing food along with their gorgeous deck set under the redwoods has quickly made it our favorite spot!\nFood: authentic ingredients and fresh hand made on-site tortillas are to die for. There is an amazing salad which is not something you can always count on at a Mexican restaurant. Don't skip the shrimp taco served on a jicama tortilla!!\nCocktails: Kill Bill Margaritas are as dangerous as they sound and my new favorite drink is the Paloma -Mezcal and grapefruit deliciousness, and there is even a drink served with a popsickle.\nAll of the above make for excellent evening out in Mill Valley~\nGet there!!", "The food is good.

The flavors were kind of bland and came with two small shreds of apricot - which were part of the listed ingredients.\n\nI got the el pastor tacos and my daughter got the carne asada tacos. The pastor tacos were mediocre- the meat was a bit burnt and the flavor mainly came from the pineapple chunks in the tacos. The carne asada tacos were TERRIBLE- not only were they cold right when they served them, but they were INCREDIBLY salty and a bit too spicy (and bland). They were so bad that we had to return them and asked for another order of the pastor tacos instead- they were okay and we were hungry.  \n\nThrough it all, we did have good service.

The broth is supposed to have a hearty and savory taste and I just didn't get that flavor from here. The broth tasted a bit too sweet for my liking.

Got the passion fruit green tea as well.\nLos Angeles seriously lacks in good chinese food but Pine & Crane is my go to when I have a craving!! I moved to venice and still make the trek to Silverlake just to indulge in this place!!\nGreat vegan options, amazing quality, and good prices - everything I could ask for!", "Dish: Minced Pork on Rice\nCost: $7\nRating: 4.25/5\nReview: Can you tell I really love ordering this dish everywhere I go?  It's just such comfort food to me! This dish is a reasonable price since it comes with the soy-braised egg. It wasn't a super small bowl either! I loved that the egg was seasoned and they had the house pickled daikon. The meat was really tasty but just a tad bit salty. Overall, I enjoyed this dish!\n\nThis spot is such a cute \"hipster\" feel and I love it! It's nice and bright inside and you order at the counter and grab a table with your number and the worker brings it out to you. Beware, it gets packed!

It's French/Mediterranean cuisine, very pricey, but absolutely delicious. Some friends and I visited for dinner on a Friday evening. This is a 3-course meal and the menu is organized as such. Everyone in my dinner party ordered something different and we all tasted each other's food. Each dish was spectacular. The service is top-notch. You will be expected to pay a Captain's tip on top of the regular waiter's tip, so be aware of that. The drinks from the bar are substantial and very tasty.  The food and wine is very expensive, but the evening was perfect. Plan to relax and enjoy your time there. The staff is very accommodating and polite and never rushed us.  If you're in the area and don't want to deal with crowds, splurge on a fantastic meal at Majorelle. You won't regret it.", "Superb. A delightful experience. The decor was lovely with magnificent flowers, the service was attentive but not overbearing and the food was excellent. One of my dining companions had the bass and the other a red snapper tagine that they made to her specifications without salt etc etc. I had the caneton a l'orange. For desert my friends ordered souffl\u00e9s (Grand Marnier and chocolate). They were perfect. I had the baba au rhum. We all had different drinks which we were also happy with. Altogether a very pleasant evening and each of us plans to go back.", "Myself and couple of girlfriends fancied a night cap after nearby dinner. We stumbled across The Lowell and Majorelle as it seemed like a perfect spot. The hotel lobby is beautiful, it truly reminds me of traditional London hotels. The concierge politely pointed us towards the bar where we got sat down at a nice table. First thing that we all noticed written on drinks menu was the $50 per person compulsory spent... this we found rather pathetic and in fact cheap. We immediately politely disputed this ridiculous necessity with our waiter who eventually told us there is no need for the minimum spent. He was very efficient and professional and happy to advise on cocktails. All three of us ended up having a drink each and some nibbles. Nothing sensational to report, just a night cap after all. Another thing struck me- we haven't been offered water, no still, sparkling or even finest New York tap....and had to ask for it instead. It's a nice enough place to bring your date to or pop in with your friends just to chat about your sex life and have an older men at the table next to you indiscreetly listen up :-)", "Sooo amazing!! From service to food to decor to mood everything was perfect for a romantic dinner with my husband. The staff went above and beyond to take care of us and make the night perfect in every way. They check your temperature at the door, all the tables are spaced apart with glass barriers between some tables, ventilation and air filters inside and if you prefer they have a lovely outdoor dining area. Felt like they did everything they can possibly do to adhere to safety protocol. Food was delicious. Oysters were very fresh, sea scallops cooked to perfection. Tried the dish of the day which was shrimp skewered in rosemary with risotto.. loved it! Husband enjoyed his filet mignon which was juicy and cooked medium rare. For dessert we had \"Oeuf a la neige\" which is like the foamy island dessert and looks spectacular. Raspberry souffle was like eating a cloud. Definitely highly recommend!", "Made a Saturday, 8:30pm dinner reservation to celebrate an anniversary, and we weren't particularly impressed. First, it took nearly 40 minutes to get our table ready despite making a reservation, and then we were tucked into a tight seat near the entrance behind a screen panel, where we could hear the clattering of dishes and where people would walk by constantly. The ambiance in the restaurant was certainly nice, but not from our seat.\n\nFor a meal at this price point with a reservation, we would have expected faster and better seating. The food was good, but nothing special. Desserts were much better.\n- Salade Majorelle: refreshing and light\n- Soupe du jour: very good\n- Tajine d'agneu: heavily spiced of cumin and a bit tart\n- Escalopine: delicious and very well cooked and seasoned\n- Tarte du chef: amazing\n- Chocolat souffl\u00e9: extremely good\n\nFor a more impressive French meal at this price point, I'd recommend La Grenouille.", "The Lowell Hotel restaurant on 63rd Street.  Fixed prix menu but you have option of a la carte.  We got a chilly reception.  No smiles.  Most gentlemen wearing jackets.  Not sure if required.  We don't care and were tres casual.  Besides the chill factor we concentrated on our friends so had an extraordinary time\nThe butternut squash soup was great. The Majorelle salad was light and complex.  The scallop app was good.  The salmon crudo was tres bland.  The fish tangine was cooked well. The sole was breaded and cut into little pieces.  Dont get that.

They are the size of a taquito.\n\nSmall parking in the front and a larger lot in the back. Outside entrance does not look like a restaurant but it is a burrito spot. Small inside seating area. Fast food self seating style.\n\nBirria - $3.15 - Tender shredded beef. Great spice flavor.\nDeshebrada - $3.15 - Mild flavor, I liked the birria more.\nChicharron - $3.15 - Soft mushy pork rinds. I wanted more crisp or texture.\nChicken Tinga - $3.15 - Chicken was good, potato was a bit of filler.\nFrijuoles y Queso - $3 - Beans were tasty and not over powering. Good even mix of beans and cheese.\n\nI really enjoyed the burritos here. Very different flavors from your normal mexican joint. 2-3 can easily fill you up. I shared the 5 and we were both satisfied.", "I'm totally addicted to this place. Homemade tortillas make the simplest of foods taste so comforting and addictive. Love that their menu is short and simple since it usually takes me an hour to decide what to order anything.\n\nTheir burritos are skinny and on the small side which is OK by me since it allows me try more stuff.\n\nCheese Quesadilla: If you just want to enjoy tortilla heaven, get these. So simple, yet so good and comforting\n\nBirria Burrito: Quite juicy inside with shredded beef. Very tasty, no fat in the meat!\n\nBean and Cheese Burrito: Another simple, yet addictive item\n\nChicharron Burrito: Surprised it was all soft inside. Not really my personal preference, but wasn't too bad. Maybe I'll acquire a liking for it down the line.\n\nComplimentary homemade chips and salsa: So good! The chips are thick, crunchy and go well with the salsa. I let the juices of the burria burrito drop on to the chips for added flavoring.\n\nOrdering confusion! You can order at the cashier, pay there and they'll bring the food out to you. Or you can have the cashier come over to your table, take your order and bring the food out to you. Make sure to pay before leaving though. I forgot to once, so sorry!!!", "Been here a couple of time and this is a definite must try. The burritos aren't the typical burritos they're more like large rolled tacos (except not fried)  so 3-4 would probably be a safe amount if you like to eat. The flavors are all incredibly good though. All of the burritos are made with the same flour tortilla which luckily is well made. The birria is definitely the standout very flavorful and a good amount of meat. The chicken tinga is worth trying too good amount of chicken and potatoes nice zesty marinade. The chicharron is the stewed kind and a good one if you like spicy food as it can get pretty spicy. The shredded beef and green Chile is also a favorite of mine the beef is super tender and green Chile sauce is great. They also have quesadillas but honestly I haven't tried them yet. Pretty limited menu but what they make is worth a try. Just a personal recommendation though is try it with some avocado works surprisingly well. We usually mash and avocado with some lime and salt then just put some on. Works especially well with the birria de res and the chicken tinga in my opinion.", "Handmade tortillas are delicious! Oh man that bean and cheese burrito is awesome! The salsa also isn't too spicy at all. It's just a gush of deliciousness! They've also got a truck parked out in Santa Ana as well! The owner is very friendly and gave me a great run down about the business. The birria burrito is the marinated stewed shredded beef that is the signature here. I would definitely come back for more homemade tortillas!\n\nRecommendation: Bean and cheese burrito", "This hole in the wall place offers the best Mexican Burritos in all of California, with that being said, probably the best outside of Mexico.\n\nTheir Burritos are petite in size, very juicy and stuffed with just the perfect amount of meats, unlike typical burritos, are usually fat, oversized and over stuffed with rice and beans, petite sized burritos allowed me to try different meat options as well.\n\nMy fav has to be the Birria Burritos, it's super juicy and tasty, it got pretty messy coz the juice were dripping all over the place, very satisfying and content, that's how I like it!\n\nThey also offer coke in a glass bottle, which btw taste completely different than the ones off a coke can. The sweetness coming out from a bottle is made from sugar cane, verses coke from a can, they only use artificial sugar.\n\nAll in all, this place is higly recommended, don't ever call yourself a native Californian and/or native Angeleno if you haven't been to this restaurant.", "We eat these mini burritos all the time. The menu is actually pretty extensive but I have only tried the five different burritos. While the tortilla is always delicious, I was definitely cheated on the filling today.

The table was waiting for us when we arrived. Restaurant is directly across the street from Millennium Park. It's on the smaller side which considering the location is a plus.  Prices are what you'd expect for the neighborhood.  We started with the Margarita Pizza which reminded me of pizzas from Italy. Thin crust was a bit charred. Right amount of sauce and cheese. Very good!  Next we ordered the bruschetta appetizer. It's two pieces but loaded with prosciutto on top of truffled ricotta. This was my favorite--sooo good. For dinner, I had the lasagna which was layered with wild mushrooms, herbed ricotta and a white cream sauce.  It was served in a casserole style dish. Arrived at the table steaming hot and if you're a mushroom fan, you'll be in heaven. For dessert, I tried both the house made vanilla and chocolate gelato. I've had better, but still very good, but go for the chocolate which is more rich and flavorful. And it's only $3 a bowl--best bargain on the menu!  Wine list is extensive.

We were disappointed! Maybe it was an off night.\n\nRigatoni Bolognese, on the other hand was good. Catalpa Farms lamb ragout, parmesan cheese.

The wine list is extensive and their cocktail offerings are inventive, so no matter what you're drinking they're sure to have something that appeals to you. But the real reason to go back again (and again...) is the food. We started with the bruschetta (both nights) and everyone at the table was speechless while they ate. Rich and delicious with prosciutto and truffle ricotta and balsamic, I could've eaten ten plates. Next up was the pasta which was also divine - we had rigatoni with lamb ragu and the capatelli. Both dishes were out of this world - fresh pasta, beautifully crafted sauces, and the right portion size to satisfy but not overwhelm. We finished up with dessert, and the bombolini and blood orange tart were both perfection. Our only (very minor) complain was that the tiramisu is not a traditional tiramisu and left just a little to be desired. But at that point in the otherwise incredible meal, none of us cared. I can't wait to go back to Chicago and eat here again.", "I've been twice now and so far, I have to say I'm extremely impressed.  The interior is very homey but in an upscale way.  The booths all have the couch against the wall, which I like. The bar area is small, but it's nice.  They have a white wine on their menu I had never heard of, Garganega, which is very tasty.  The service has been very good as well.  I sat at the bar and people were very nice and chatty, but not overly so.  Both times I got the special salad they had.  I can't remember everything that was in the first one but it was very good.  The second one, this was amazing.  There were scallops, which were just cooked through but had a nice, dark crust on the outside.  Arugula, chickpeas, cucumbers and pickled fennel.  I think it could have used some onions but this salad was amazing.  It had a creamy dressing underneath, which was a smart idea since it was creamy and you didn't want to smother this beautiful salad in something so dense.  The dressing went very well with the pickled fennel and cucumbers as well.  Perfection!  This will be added to my rotation.", "An absolute must for all the right reasons. Everything about this restaurant is top-notch. The food is excellently well balanced in flavors and proportions , while the service is warm, friendly and attentive. My guess is that it must start from the example of top management who treat you like family from the moment you arrive.

The whole area around reception and in the bar was very loud and shoulder to shoulder with people. This was a very uncomfortable atmosphere. When we went back to check on our table, the hostesses were rude. By 8:30 we were still not seated. This restaurant clearly over-books their tables. Many people were over-served from waiting for their table for so long. Eventually a fight broke out and someone fell into a table. At this point, we left - just as the police were pulling up!  Stay away!", "Originally had a res for the 54th Street location for Sunday night, post-theatre dinner. However they called to tell us the restaurant was empty and would we mind dining at another location. (Never going there again.) It was a blessing. When we arrived at the Park Avenue location, we were greeted by the very amiable Manager, Jeff, who welcomed us warmly, even though it was 9:55 and they were closing at 10:30. (We know what a pain that can be for the staff who has already been working a very long shift.) Out waiter, Admir, was super friendly and warm, and made us feel very welcome, even at such late an hour.\n\nTo make a long story short, the service was top-notch. The food delicious! We had a Caesar salad, the tuna tartare, steak for two with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach and a slice of chocolate mousse cake for dessert. Everything was perfect and delicious! We will definitely be back!.", "Solid place for steak in the city. Yes you can trek all the way to Williamsburg for Peter Luger's, but why bother when you can eat local in Manhattan? The porterhouses here are cooked to perfection. The service is great too. They have multiple servers attending to your every needs.\n\nSimilar spot to Ben and Jacks and Benjamin's. Obviously you want to do the family style pre-cut porterhouses.\n\nYou will not be disappointed by this place.", "Where do I start ? The bacon is amazing to start. Shrimp was A1 of course .

The char siu had a great flavor but it was cold when we got it - it would have been nice for it to be piping hot.\n\nThe jelly corn is one of those things that looks great but is incredibly underwhelming. Thee jelly corn just lacked any sort of flavor - it was like if someone whispered \"sweetness\" as you were eating plain gelatin and corn. The sauce was way too thin to enjoy - in LARGE part due to the serving dish and utensils. It's served on a plate and you can't really spoon the sauce so the sauce just pools at the bottom and stays there. We actually had a hell of a time cutting the jelly and spilled sauce everywhere.

You can tell a lot of thought was put into the little details of designing this restaurant.\n\nBetween two, we got the tiradito, anticucho, char siu, lomo saltado, side of garlic rice and black sesame cheesecake tart. Tiradito was such a flavorful ceviche, a must order. The char siu had a really good sauce, perfectly cooked. The fries in the lomo were extra crispy so the sauce never wilted them. The garlic rice compliments every dish nicely. We loved every bite of everything - although the anticucho could have been served without the salt on top. Shout out to our waitress Jordan! She was super sweet and informative while helping us make menu decisions.\n\nRika, the owner, came by to say hi and check in with us.

The order came with 1/2 a chicken, so there was plenty for leftovers if you couldn't finish it all at once ;)\n\nI'm looking forward to eating in after the pandemic and tasting everything hot. The prices are a bit high but the quality is there so at least you know you are getting what you pay for in terms of ingredients.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because everything was good but nothing stood out as great.

She was multilingual and genuinely had the best energy, style, and taste. Our favorite meal item was the Braised Short Rib & Anticucho (the chimichurri it came with was *chef's kiss*). The interior decoration was so beautiful and we were in love. My friends and I were running 20 minutes late (we had reserved outdoor seating) and we were nervous we would lose our spot since when we had called in the guy had told us we would lose our table. Once we had arrived, the woman working the check-in was very sweet and welcoming as well and marked us down for our table - we waited maybe another 20 minutes and being late ended up working in our favor because our outdoor reservation turned into an indoor seating situation!

Be sure to sample bubbling-hot Taepo chicken curry, rich with coconut milk, brightly flavored with turmeric and tender morning glory stems.

It's on my (and Jonathon Gold's) short list of LA restaurants that you absolutely have to eat at.\n\nThat said, I very nearly gave them 4 stars because the service ranges from acceptable to down right bad. It is a testament to how great the food is that even after experiencing some truly awful service I'm always itching to go back.\n\nThe menu is like no other Thai place you've ever eaten at. Sure there is pad thai and pad see ewe but beyond that are dozens of unique dishes that you can only find at Jitlada (and presumably southern Thailand). Everything I've ordered has been great, and it is always a little different than what I'm expecting. The Morning Glory Salad is fantastic. Like the leafy greens in some of their other dishes the veggies are lightly coated in batter and fried. How they give it that crispy deliciousness without wilting the leaves is beyond me.\n\nThese little surprises make a meal at Jitlada a unique experience. Despite being a dumpy little place in a strip mall I'd say that Jitlada is as important to the LA food scene as Susan Feniger or the food truck craze.

Yet for some reason, I like to eat a lot of spicy food.  I decided to go slightly off the path a little with the Crying Tiger with beef.  This was excellent, although as other reviewers have noted, the portion is a little small for the price.  The flavor of the beef was really solid with lime and a little bit of heat.  The chili sauce on the side really took it over the top.  Definitely spicy but not overly and still very flavorful.\n\nMe and my wife sat next to a regular who asked them to just bring food to his table.  He let me try a papaya and shrimp curry with chili which unbelievably good.  Very spicy, much more than the Crying Tiger.\n\nMy wife had the pad thai which was very good.  I'm not sure how else to describe it other than the fact it didn't taste Americanized at all.\n\nWe'll definitely be returning here. Highly recommended.", "Overall pretty good. First time trying this location I had simply driven in for a quick take out dinner.  I was a bit shocked by the prices in comparison to all of the Thai restaurants in the area, it was quite a lot more expensive.  I decided to try the yellow curry with pork and wow it was amazing.  Usually I'm not a huge pork fan since it's dry much of the time, but this was juicy and great flavor!! Pretty quick service as well and friendly staff that tried to help as much as they could with my questions.\n\nOne star taken away for two reasons, first was the overpriced menu items, simply not worth what they're asking on most of the dishes.  2nd was the fact that it was insanely hot inside and they don't seem to have a working AC, only an extremely loud fan that was shaking all of the pictures on their walls.  If they're charging so much, you'd expect to be in a more comfortable setting, not roasting in the 100+ degree weather inside (happy that I took mine to go and ate at home)", "Jitlada specializes in southern Thai cuisine, so be sure to order mainly from the back half for the menu. If you can't take spicy, then tread carefully because this place is HOT. The front half of the menu includes the regular pad Thai and fried rice dishes.\n\nWe got the crying tiger (which is not spicy on its own), the taepo chicken curry, a beef basil dish and a catfish curry. The crying tiger was so tender and nicely seasoned on its own, but the sauce gives it a good kick. The Taepo chicken curry is less spicy than their jungle curry (or so they say). It was also a bit tangy, which was needed to balance out the heat. I wish I could give more details on the taste but I stopped feeling my tongue about 7 minutes in. All I know is order whatever sounds good and it will be! Great service too and the waitresses we had were very friendly.", "I was on a mission. I came from Sacramento to visit this glorious, proud little place on 4/3/21. It was a quiet Saturday, and we trekked from our hotel near LAX to grab the turmeric sea bass and rice with some crispy spring rolls.\n\nI ordered through GrubHub and it was finished faster than we could arrive so the crispiness faded, but the smell was just UNREAL! I ordered a medium seabass which was more than enough for 2 adults. The inside was so charming, with their awards and sketches from Matt Groening, articles and pictures from the late Jonathan Gold. They have trophies everywhere.\n\nI was worried the fish would be too spicy, as they are known for. I ordered it medium spicy and the sauces were served on the side. We tried it without the sauce, and it tasted like fish. The garlic was good and flavorful on its own. Once we put the sauces on, it was FIERY and perfect. We couldn't stop eating it.\n\nImagine 2 grown adults in a hotel room tearing apart a whole seabass with paper plates and pouring the best sauces we'd ever tasted and kept eating more! It was worth it. It was a shame it wasn't available for dine-in. I would love to meet Jazz in person!", "I'm upgrading my review seeing as how the customer service at this restaurant has improved markedly in the last few years. This is without a doubt the best tasting Thai food in town.\n\nMy personal favorite is the red curry chicken. It is amazing! Apparently they brew their own red curry paste in-house. The tom kha gai soup is also wonderful, and the super-hot Khua Kling Phat Tha Lung (Beef Dry Curry) was as fiery as promised once they took it to the kitchen and made it \"extra spicy\".

However, we ordered the Mirza Ghasemi (grilled eggplant, tomato, egg, and garlic - turned into a schmear) as an appetizer and that served as a good sauce for the dishes.\n\nOutside of the rice I really liked their Makhlout dessert - rice noodles with crushed ice, rose water and sugar, topped with saffron and pistachio ice cream.\n\nRice is just so versatile.", "For years I have defended Shalizaar when friends and family have criticized the restaurant for poor service and mediocre food. We have been patronized Shalizaar when it first started out on 25th avenue in San Mateo maybe 20 years ago! Last night we ordered Soltani which is a signature dish of Persian cuisine. It should consist of a skewer of Barg Kabob which should be a very high grade of fillet mignon cut of beef  and a skewer of ground koobideh which is ground beef mixed with onions and seasoning. While I understand times are challenging and we are grateful for restaurants being open for take out, last nights dinner was simply awful! The koobideh was edible but the Barg was cheap cut of beef, overcooked, dry and old! For almost $30 for that one dish, I would rather had eaten McDonalds!!\n\nEnough is enough! Please take this review seriously! You need to bring back your quality of food despite COVID if you are going to charge top money! I rather drive to Aria in Redwood City than ever order food from your restaurant again or even come to your restaurant when things get back to normal.  I love Persian Food and last night's dinner was a disgrace!", "If we were just talking about food, then this place would get 4 stars from me. However, thanks to the male owner/host  they lost a star. He was extremely unfriendly and acted like we were not welcome.\n\nWe had a large party (10+) for which I made a reservation. The person who answered said no problem, and that the time I asked for was \"perfect\".\n\nWe got there and checked in with the female hostess (SUPER friendly! If we'd had her all night I would have no issues with this place!). At this point a few of my friends came with unexpected guests (+2) and we asked the hostess if we could have a few more chairs. It didn't seem to be an issue until the male owner walked by and pretty much said \"You're taking up too much space and crowding out the other customers\".\n\nWe looked around and there were PLENTY of open tables...\n\nOn to positives:\n\n-Female hostess has an amazing memory. She took all of our orders without writing them down-- and they came out perfect!\n-Koobideh is sublime~\n-Prices are reasonable.\n\nDespite all of those pluses, I think that we'll be giving Kabul in San Carlos our business from now on.", "I've always wanted to try this place and now I finally had my chance!!!!\nWe ate there at my brother's 60th Surprise party and thankfully, I was not disappointed!!!! Everything, from the Restaurant to the Food was Superb!!!!!\nThe appetizers were interesting and delicious!!!! And the Main course, which was a whole Meat Platter, served on Lavosh bread, was The Headliner that didn't disappoint!!!!\nMy favorite was the Lamb Chops and Chicken thigh!!!!

Lovely.  \n\nI can't really describe it.  It very much reminded me of a combination of Indian and Mediterranean food.  The menu consisted mainly of shish kabobs, which I love.\n\nEvery table gets a basket of hot flat bread and another basket that has goat cheese, walnuts, and a variety of herbs (mint, cilantro, and I think, lemongrass?)  You roll it up in the flat bread and enjoy.\n\nFor lunch, I had the Barg - marinated filet mignon served with a roasted tomato and  rice.  My colleagues had the lamb shank served buried under a mound of dill and fava bean rice, and the chicken kabob.\n\nEverything was delicious.  Service was good.  The restaurant is very comfortable.  A little 'formal' looking for lunch, but it's a perfect place for a nice dinner.", "Shalizaar is the best Persian restaurant I've been to so far!

These chefs know when to leave a dish alone so there\u2019s nothing on the plate that isn\u2019t serving a purpose.

Manhatta is quiet enough for a date or to catch up with a friend but it also has a lively scene at the bar. For a more intimate setting, there's a small separate sitting room for drinks as well.\n\nThe drinks are strong and not overpriced. Our tab was around $50 for four drinks AND gratuity is included (of course feel free to leave your bartenders some extra cash though). I was truly shocked by how good those prices were for cocktails with a view.\n\nAs far the attire goes, you'll fit in if you dress up but you'll also fit in just fine if you're dressed clean casual. Overall I'd highly recommend Manhatta for drinks and would love to come back to try their dinner.", "Restaurant on the upper floors of the former Chase building down on Liberty. They have great views around the restaurant to the city, and they were able to squeeze us into the bar area with a last-minute reservation for dessert. Downstairs they have a coat check, and six elevators that go straight up to the restaurant.\n\nThe toasted marshmellow - overwhelmed by smokiness, sadly, it could have been really good but no marshmellow flavor and the sweet sugar at the bottom was too hard to crack off the plate. They like coffee fragments a bit too much - expresso in the chocolate souffle (the souffle was good - the expresso sauce poured in right after it arrived at the table). I had a bit of the souffle (without expresso) and that was good. The satsuma sorbet, though, an olive oil cake, was light and enjoyable unlike the rest of the desserts. So 1 out of 3 for me? If you like heavy smokey flavors or coffee, you'll be better off with the desserts at the moment.\n\nThey also provided a few dessert pieces compliments of the chef - a couple of small brownie-like treats and a cake truffle that was ok, but none of them leaving much of an impression at the table.", "Finally I had the chance to try out this restaurant on a whim. I walked in and although wasn't able to make a reservation, I was accommodated and seated by the open kitchen(bar seating style). I did the dinner pre-fixe menu and ordered the lobster quenelle as the first course, wagyu coulotte for my second course, and the vanilla souffl\u00e9 for dessert. For $78 this was a great price considering the quality of the food, great view of manhattan 60 floors up, the exceptional service from entering the establishment to exiting. Everyone was very courteous and pleasant. I would definitely come back again and would like to try some of the offerings on their menu like the French onion burger. They are a no tipping establishment so it's very convenient and they prefer to accept credit cards as payment than cash. This place is perfect for special occasions.", "View, service, and setting were incredible. Food was completely mediocre. Carrot soup was very good. La Marotte was so so. The mains were terrible. The burger was actually bad, which is hard to do -- stone cold onion rings, sitting in sauce that made the bottom bun fall apart (impossible to eat!), lukewarm burger with congealed cheese, and not very flavorful. The striped sea bass itself was delicious, but it was sitting in a bath of flavorless broth and half-cooked vegetables.\n\nI'll go back for the view and service, but just to get a drink at the bar.", "4.5 stars. This was my second time at Manhatta - the first, I ate at the actual restaurant with my friend which was a wonderful fine dining experience and one that I would consider again for a special occasion. I had remembered thinking the bar also looked like worth checking out so when my friends and I were discussing a girls night, I proposed it as a choice. We were able to walk in at 6:30 and immediately sit down at the bar on a Thursday night even though it seemed pretty crowded.\n\nYeah, the drinks are a little pricey - but as with most Danny Meyer restaurants, gratuity is included so they end up pricing out around the same as a nice Manhattan cocktail bar. The drinks were delicious and well crafted but extremely strong so a good value. Not to mention the beautiful views!\n\nMy friend and I were feeling a little peckish and decided to share the French Onion burger. I am not a burger person but this was an excellent burger. If you are a burger person I highly recommend you try it.\n\nAll in all it was a nice experience. I think this is a great bar to impress out of towners with if you are looking for somewhere special and quintessentially New York to go.", "Update - went for the pre-fix dinner tonight.

I know they are trying to be fine dining but any of the hundreds of Gastropubs in LA are far better (Westside Tavern, Father's Office, Public School, Library Bar) at far better prices and beer and wine selections.", "Visited this restaurant with a group. The ambience is cute though not spectacular. The food tastes were all on point. The staff was super friendly and accommodating.\n\nMy only gripe is that as a \"sharing\" family style restaurant the potions are lacking. Even the platters that are meant to serve several people are quite tiny. The amount of food--per plate--is quite a joke and can make for a costly experience if you're not aware. Seemed like the food is served on LARGE plate but it is either spread out or pushed to one side. It makes for a lovely presentation but an unsatisfactory meal. Thankfully we weren't very hungry so the sampler bites from each plate worked out well!\n\nAs for cocktails, the mule tasted great. It may have been better in a copper mug ;)", "Love this place! Beautiful laid back yet classy restaurant with a wine bar attached in the back equals fabulousness! As my friend and I were killing time before our reservations, we had a glass of Syrah in the wine bar and it converted me into a Syrah fan. Both places have that artistic steampunk vibe you'd see in gastropubs these days. We were escorted from the bar to the restaurant and received excellent, friendly service! Meals are served family style so we ordered the brussel sprouts and the short ribs and they were fantastic! The sprouts were carmelized crispy with a soy & sesame sweetness and tang while the sliced short ribs had a perfectly salted bark. It was topped over a bed of flavorful farm vegetables (and I'm not much of a veggie water and I loved it!) Just these two items were perfect as we did have their cocktails to finish- the mule was awesome! They presented my friend with a birthday dessert that looked like a piece of art! I would totally come back here if I'm in town because of the awesome food, excellent service and local vibe!", "I loveeeeeee this place!  Went in with a friend for a \"quick bite\" but soon realized, this place is amazing, and worth more of our time!  The duck liver & belgian waffles\nis AMAZING, the roasted beets & burrata is not just any plate, its DELICIOUS!  I also had butternut squash & quinoa which was the best squash plate i've ever had.  Our service: Milad, was also fantastic.  He waited on us hand and foot, and took very good care of us, extremely thoughtful, and very fast! I love this place and will definitely be back!  Thanks Lark! and Thank you Milad, you are amazing!", "The Lark is a beautiful restaurant that has a cool vibe. It is located in the art scene of SB known as the \"funk zone\" near the wharf. But if you are vegan forget it. They have nothing on the menu for you and no vegetarian main dishes. It is a sharing menu and if you eat meat or fish it's AMAZING. But if you don't you may go away a little hungry or have to order too many small dishes which add up $$$. It's kinda shocking given that it's a farm to table restaurant in Cali. The food was terrific though. We ate several fish dishes and two \"snacks\" without meat. It was terrific food. And the drinks were awesome. Service was exceptional.", "The ambiance of the restaurant is quaint and intimate and cozy. Patio had plenty of heaters to keep everyone toasty. The food was perfection. First off, the popcorn with sage and pepper and salt was addictive. The pumpkin spice with ice cream dessert was the perfect size for 4 to share.\nTuna, scallops, tomato salad and roasted pig toast with smoked tomatoes and creamy cheese  was all spot on.  My only complaint might be that when I go for just a romantic evening with just one person, we won't get to try so many dishes because they are well portioned. Too many delicious choices.

It's great to see a place serving upscale, Napa style barbecue without sacrificing the down home goodness that makes barbecue what it is!\n\nFor dessert, I definitely recommend their \"famous\" lemon lime tart served under \"that ridiculously tall brown sugar meringue,\" although chocolate lovers would probably opt for the warm chocolate tart, which my son devoured in a matter of seconds.\n\nWe'll definitely be returning next time we're in the area!", "\"Surrounded by vineyards, this cozy country grill has warmth and character that appeals to both locals and visitors.\" - as taken from their website.\n\nI have to agree. Mustards Grill is definitely worth a stop on your next Napa/Calistoga/wine country trip. I've been there twice for lunch only and not for dinner, so the experience may differ in the evening.\n\nPros: beautiful vineyard setting, bright social atmosphere, great wait staff service, variety of drinks, tasty fresh dishes\n\nCons: can be a long wait, may be noisy at times because of lots of customers, generally small tables so large groups questionable (although I'm sure the staff will accomodate), a bit spendy for the portions.\n\nMy favorite menu item: Calamari!!!  Try it. The vegetable mix it comes with is delicious and unique. Undoubtedly one of the best appetizers I've had in ANY restaurant.\n\nThis place should't be your choice for a quiet, romantic meal. Instead, it's happy, bright and a good \"date\" meal for the day. After my girlfriend and I were disappointed with mediocre restaurants in the area, we decided to check out Mustards and we weren't disappointed. If it fits you budget, Mustards Grill will be a culinary highlight of your wine country excursions.", "By far the best overall experience in the Valley.\n\nThe food is incredible, the specials are wide ranging and the quality of products used are far above the competition. Not to mention the staff is absolutely incredible and always willing to accommodate anyone.  \n\nYou have an endless selection of restaurants in this area, but do yourself a favor and make this your first stop.\n\nAs many have said, make sure to make reservation, the bar and the restaurant fill up almost immediately after opening. This is not a place to just grab a quick bite and go. It is an experience. Spend some time here, talk to the staff, take a stroll through the garden and enjoy yourself.\n\nFavorite meal: Onion rings as an appetizer. Followed by the Truckstop (a rotating special usually some form of meat and potatoes) and for desert they make a a lemon meringue pie that will change your life.\n\n**PSA: If you are in there on a Friday for lunch, there may be a group of men sitting in the corner farthest from the kitchen. Feel free to throw things at them. They are my father and his friends. They have been there every Friday since the restaurants opening.", "We could not have had a better Sunday finish anywhere else. We arrived a little early for our reservation and decided to have a drink. The bar area is a little small for a group of seven but the hostess said we could take our drinks outside on the waiting patio or even walk the garden. We took full advantage of her suggestions. Instead of being inside, we soaked in the remaining warm sun that Napa had to offer. The hostess was also very accommodating when we had to adjust our party size.\n\nThe food. The food was outstanding. The group shared off each others plates so we could get the full effect. The dishes: Mongolian Pork Chop, Goat Cheese Polenta, Nieman Burger, Ahi Sandwich, Spanish Chicken Sandwich, Onion Rings, and Calamari.\n\nPork Chop was so tender and flavorful. Burger and Ahi cooked to perfection. Goat Cheese Polenta was a pleasant surprise to a familiar dish. Spanish Chicken definitely was titled appropriately. The onion rings and calamari were light and refreshing.\n\nNo one could tackle dessert. An espresso was enjoyed instead.\n\nWe will be back to take down more of the menu. Must save room for dessert. Mustard Grill is highly recommended because of the service, quality of food and location.", "The giant pork chop was crazy good. I didn't mind waiting for our table because you could stroll around their gorgeous herb/vegetable garden that they use in their dishes.  Definitely make a reservation.  Service was awesome and it's a really cute place- not stuffy at all.  They serve the bread right on the table and I think there's a seasonal menu.  If burrata is in the menu in any form you should get it - so creamy and delicious.  The portions for their dinners are huge so you'll be full and can wrap what you didn't eat up to snack on later.  Love this place and would definitely recommend.", "5 stars all across the board! Service, customer service, quality ingredients, casual ambiance... we had the tomato/seafood soup, mixed greens salad, crab/tomato risotto and grilled halibut... everything was so incredibly fresh. We were lucky and walked right in without reservations for a late lunch, I can only imagine how busy they must be during dinner time, though.

The house itself is so comfortable and welcoming, it feels like you are a guest at a friend's house rather than a hotel. The staff and everyone here are so friendly, it made me feel right at home.\n\nOnto the food. Oh I could write a novel about the dinners I've had here, but I'll restrain myself. Each night the menu changes and everything on the menu is amazing. EVERYTHING. Each night you are treated to a four course meal with an amuse bouche of some sort to start the meal. Our most recent dinner there, we had a zucchini free form ravioli, little gem salad, grilled pork chops, and a honey pie. Every course was mouth watering and gorgeous to look at. I've never had a honey pie before but it is one of the best desserts I've ever had! I nearly licked my plate.\n\nHighly recommend staying here, eating here, anything here.", "I haven't stayed at the hotel either but ate there last Friday and just want to say Oh My God, WOW was that a good meal! The salad was so fresh, delicate and crunchy with amazing croutons and delicious sauce. Then we had a halibut with mashed potatoes, water cress and an amazing saffron sauce. It totally worked, fish and mash, I've never had that combo. Then, they brought out a cheese platter with chili plums. Again, yum! The dessert was also incredible, some layered chocolate praline cake with crunchy bits.\nThis comes all in a setting that has totally captured the essence and charm of Mendocino County. Clearly these people get it. We left there after celebrating my son's 25th (gulp!) birthday and were totally satisfied. Mind, body and soul.\nThanks guys, we will be back!\nI'm even sorry for all the other 5 stars I've given out on yelp now, because this place beats them all.\nBe sure to check the website and see what they are cooking!", "This hotel and the adjoining 128 Restaurant is simply wonderful! The rooms are contemporary with an organic vibe. The staff is very helpful and overall the place is very charming. I highly recommend staying here and eating at the restaurant. The food at the restaurant is delicious and most of the food is locally grown and organic. The town of Boonville is also a very cute place - good ice cream store and cute mercantile store across the street as well. Definitely a great weekend escape.", "We got married in Hendy Woods and stayed at the Boonville Hotel for the weekend, along with several people in the wedding party. It could not have been more perfect. We stayed in the Bungalow, which was beautiful, roomy, and still cozy thanks to the potbellied stove. Our best man stayed next door in the Studio, which was a perfect compliment to the Bungalow. With the two rooms together, we had enough room for flower arranging, storing food for the wedding, serving lunch to the wedding party, and having two separate spaces for the bride and groom to get dressed. We did our first look in the gardens, and it was perfect. Everything at the Boonville Hotel is impeccably curated to make you feel relaxed and comfortable surrounded by beauty.\n\nThe service was the definition of hospitality. The staff was kind and helpful, and went out of their way to make our wedding weekend go smoothly. When it rained on Sunday, they opened their doors to our wedding guests who had been camping, and allowed us to buy them breakfast at the restaurant.\n\nThe setting was so beautiful and the art so beautifully curated that we even bought one of the paintings on the wall to commemorate our wonderful weekend.\n\nWe feel so grateful for the Boonville Hotel, and can't wait to return for our anniversaries!", "Still like it here, but the dinner this time didn't work out as well as past meals.  \n\nBegan with popcorn in duck fat and espellette with a cider shot.  A split a verdict on the appropriateness as a starter/amuse bouche.  \n\nThe first course was celeriac, leek & potato soup, fried shallots & piment chili.  It was fairly tasty, although served a little too hastily after we sat down and before we had ordered wine.\n\nNext was smoked trout with pickled vegetables, avocados and toasts.  The trout was a little too salty, but this was the highlight of the meal.  \n\nThe main entree was duck breast over farro with pomegranate and feta.   There was too much  faro and too little duck proportionately, so the duck was a little overwhelmed, which was a shame because the duck was well cooked.  \n\nDessert was Meyer lemon mousse, which was a little boring and very creamy.\n\nWines:\nBegan with two pinots: Signal Ridge (very good), another from the Anderson Valley that we can't remember.\nGot a bottle of Murder Ridge Zinfandel with dinner and as dessert, which was quite good.", "Weird experience. Woke up at 1 in the morning because the bed was so rock hard we could not sleep. We found out shortly after there was no staff in the hotel at night. We walked downstairs in the pitch black and it was super creepy! No one there. Pretty much you could probably let yourself in the side door and sleep in a room if you wanted - some room doors were just left open. You're pretty much on your own there. We decided we wanted to drive home but had no gas. Also we had no idea if there would be a gas station open so we spent the next two hours phoning nearby towns to ask them. Finally we decided to drive and check if the drive in was open and luckily the machines were on and we left at 4 am.", "What a joke. The food I like out of a Saturday night live sketch.

I don't know how I've lived this long without it with as much food as I've eaten. The sticky/chewy/greasy rice with the pork belly and fried egg, and don't forget to add a bit of the sweet red sauce they give you with the shrimp chips...ugh...I understand this is a staple of Indonesian cuisine and with a preparation like Dija Mara does it, there's no mistaking why. We also tried the tofu skewers which were vegan, but didn't taste like it (that's a compliment), and the octopus which was pressure cooked to remove the rubberiness and then grilled. All the presentation was beautiful and the food met our expectations.\nThe d\u00e9cor is sparse but very modern- the pre-fab cement appearance on the walls contrasting with the modern art is a very cool touch. Amidst the bar food and micro-brew culture that is ubiquitous with Oceanside now days, Dija is a breath of fresh air. It separates itself from the pack with a (literally) taste of something different, and yet is as welcome as any new restaurant due to its coolness. We will go back to try the other items on the menu being that everything looks awesome, and everything we tried was inventive and delicious.", "Spectacular Balinese/ American cuisine and craft cocktails too! Nothing like it exists anywhere else, so I understand now why Eater San Diego recently recognized it for the Best Restaurant Award of 2018. Such a dizzying culinary experience; light on the stomach, but complex in flavor. Their goreng/ fried rice dishes are the most popular, but their meat dishes are also wildly raved about.\n\nI ordered the *Beef Short Rib Rendang* ($20) which is a spicy meat dish with a curry-like sauce. The Sumatran spices melded perfectly with the pickled soft egg and Indo pickles. It was served a top some jasmine rice which was perfect for soaking up the creamy coconut milk sauce. The spice used for this dish was unusual in that it didn't burn you like a chili pepper would. It was a more subtle herbal burn with a heavy dose of lemon grass, turmeric, and ginger. Such a satisfying meal! I also had a *Lychee Camo* cocktail ($8) which was made with a lychee & chamomile infused rice spirit. This one came out very frothy as if it had been made with egg whites. Extremely light and sweet with a definite tea-like character. The Balinese affair is just so thoughtfully prepared that it is certainly deserving of a visit. Your taste buds will be blown away for sure.", "Went a second time in a party of 4 and it was even better than our first 5 star list. The whole fish at $21 was an incredibly delicious dish at a very reasonable price.

Four of us each had 2 drinks and spared no expense in ordering a lot of dishes, yet the big was just $170.\n\nOriginal review\nJust a delightful place that serves spectacular dishes in a tapas style. Four of us tried for the first time and each of the 6 dishes we ordered were unique and outstanding. Loved them all: eggplant, greens, chicken and lamb skewers, corn fritters, and shrimp rice.

The restaurant is very inviting, comfortable, and friendly. The service is topnotch and attentive, and they make you feel right at home. The food is amazing, with a nice mix of savory, tangy, and a little kick with spice that goes a long way. Some dishes I recommend are as follows:\n\n-Beef Rendang: it is juicy, crispy, floral, and flavorful (and the coconut rice that comes with it is fabulous)\n-Nasi Goreng: it has a wonderful mix of seafood, pork, crunchy rice, and that sunny egg lifts the dish (and I usually prefer hard eggs!)\n-Sambal octopus - the tartness of the lemon and the blackening from the grill perfectly complement the fresh octopus\n-Lamb satay: the tomato sambal, onions, and yogurt work so well with the spice marinade on the lamb\n\nI highly recommend dining at Dija Mara, and wish them all the best. I hope more customers will be there in the time to come. I'll definitely be back! :)", "One of the best restaurants in North County.

Upon walking in, I was amazed with what they made of this space - it is absolutely humongous and stunning-  go figure- it's 5,300 square feet! They have a spacious dining room to the left filled with several tables, an intimate \"Chef's Counter\" where you can sit and watch where the magic happens in the kitchen, or a traditional Bar to the right.\n\nI was wondering where the name Bellota came from and noticed the were a half dozen cured hams hanging in the back wall which were the inspiration for the name of the restaurant-  named after Spain's Jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico (from Bellota).\n\nSince we were just here for appetizers and snacks, we opted for the bar seats! We ordered the \"MAR Y MONTANA\" TOWER for 2- $50 which included 5 different crudos/tapas. They were each distinct, refreshing, and delicious.\n\nWe also ordered the Uni Croqueta- these were good but I really couldn't taste much Uni. For $15 for 3 bites, I may opt for different tapas first!\n\nOverall- this is an exciting restaurant to join SOMA and can't wait to return for date night or even a large party!", "LOVE THIS PLACE! Bellota has opened for about 4 months or so and I must say, I should've came sooner! It's a new Spain inspired restaurant and I love the interior and the server was super helpful. 10 Stars to the server!! I forgot his name...sigh but he was awesome!\n\nBellota definitely has a spanish flavor to it. I highly recommend coming to this spot. They are also known for their paella too. What's great is that if you want to try two different paellas you can do so! They have an option to combine two paella together ~50.\n\nWhat I've tried:\n\nTAPAS\n- Croqueta: creamy clam & sea urchin fritter, pickled ramp, seaweed powder\n- Guisante: raw, sugar snap pea & tendril, queso fresco dressing, cashew dukkah\n- Albondiga: yogurt braised, chicken meatball, spinach, migas, pomegranate agridulce\n\nPAELLA Y ARROZ\n**Combo of two paellas:\n- Pollo: paella, roasted chicken breast, braised chicken leg, chorizo, cauli ower, tomato\n- Fideau: paella of rice & noodle, \"the SF treat,\" gulf shrimp, scallop, asparagus, squid & ink", "Tasty if overpriced Spanish tapas and drinks in a stylish setting in the airbnb building. Sat at the bar and received so-so service from the (admittedly busy) bartenders. Didn't feel particularly well-attended to, especially for multiple $14-$15 drinks between 4 people. Try the No Mi Culpa. The happy hour dishes for $7 were a good deal but the embutido plate, although good, was a bit over at $24 IMO. But I guess if you've got .com money (it's SF after all), it's par for the course. Feel free to add 1-2 star depending on your budget.", "Great addition to the neighborhood - beautiful ambiance, has live music, good food overall!\n\nVisited a few months ago during the holidays, on a random Wed/Thurs night I think - I love how expansive it was, although the bar was sort of empty and lacked the energy I so have come to love in SF restaurants. I can't comment on cocktails because I only had a Spanish red wine (can't remember which one) but the brusela and patatas bravas was very well seasoned and IMO the former made my list of top ten fave Brussels sprout dishes. We also had the Dividida paella with the lechon and fideua and this was HUGE so prepare yourselves for the amount - aside from that it was disappointing as it lacked the typical deep spice/flavor and the bottom wasn't crispy enough. Given some of my comments docking it 1.5 star, rounded down as I can't remember the service being spectacular.\n\nStill would visit again and particularly on a weekend for the live music and further tastings of the menu.", "Came to celebrate a friends bday on a Wednesday night. We called them on the way to let them know we would be about 40 minutes late due to the traffic which stalled traffic due to the weather.\n\nWe were seated right away at the counter where the paella is prepared and boy what an experience. By sitting there we saw the crab paella being made and decided to order it instead of what we originally planned to order.\n\nTalk about blessings in disguise the crab paella was delicious and we by also sitting there we got to see Paella Willie at work as well as our great waitress Jiv was very attentive and knowledgeable. She also let us know the crab paella will only be available through crab season.\n\nSo check out my pictures of all the rest of the stuff we ordered another thumbs up to Bellota.", "Love the warm and lively ambience here with the open kitchen. Definitely felt like I was on vacation somewhere far far away from San Francisco after stepping foot into the restaurant.\n\nGreat place for happy hour or dinner for a large group or for a date.\n\nReservations for dinner is recommended, however, I did manage to snag two tables next to the bar for a group of five on a Thursday night at 7:45pm.\n\nThe food here is pricey but DELICIOUS. Loved everything we ordered.\n\nHighly recommend the sangria here ($5 during happy hour).\n\nIf you love sea urchin, then you must try the clam and sea urchin fritter. Each ball was absolutely delightful.\n\nThe Pluma Paella adorned with acorn-fed iberico pork shoulder is heavenly. The best part is the char. Don't forget to scrape that off the pan. Mmm-hmm.\n\nThe braised chicken paella was a little underwhelming in comparison. Tasted too much like it was doused in BBQ sauce.", "So sad they closed during the pandemic, even for outdoor dining.

A very unassuming bar counter that fits no more than 8 seats.  You'll easily breeze by it if you aren't looking for it.\n\nIt's rare to find a full nigiri tasting, where fish after fish is this phenomenal.  The staff is super friendly and goes above and beyond to accommodate.  The chef is super knowledgeable and his menu follows the seasons of the fish.  What you'll get one week, could be completely different from the next.  \n\nIn a city where an omakase can be $250+, Oma Station is an ABSOLUTE value.  There are three levels and I highly recommend the Secret Menu.  The chef sources some of the best nigiri you'll find in San Francisco.  Some seasonal gems include geoduck and shima aji (I won't spoil the rest).\n\nThe chef's toro handroll and uni & ikura bowl are NOT TO BE MISSED.  If you can snag a rez (which can be a challenge), absolutely go.\n\nI'm already looking for the next open rez.", "I've been to Oma twice already, and just booked a third reservation! This place is incredible, and provides a similar, if not better, experience compared to other Michelin-starred omakases in SF.\n\nAt many omakases I've eaten, at least a few pieces are meh, especially with the lighter fish that don't necessarily have as much flavor, or melt-in-your-mouth texture on their own, compared to something like bluefin tuna. This is not the case at Oma, where even the otherwise \"boring\" fish are creatively and perfectly seasoned with different combinations of citrus, caviar and other treats. Every piece -- at both times I've gone! -- has been memorable and unique in its own way.\n\nThis is all a huge testament to the work that the chefs and host put together. They provide an exceptional experience, are all incredibly nice (and hilarious), and manage to do it all while being down to earth and not stuck-up. If you consider yourself a sushi fan, you MUST go to Oma. These guys are doing amazing work, and they have super bright futures ahead of them.\n\nThank you for such amazing meals so far, and we can't wait for more!", "Sushi Chef Wilson serves up some good nigiri. My girlfriend and I were walking around the mall in J-town, and i happen to accidentally run into this place. I looked it up online and quickly made lunch reservations for the next day. The prices of the omakase are reasonably priced. The service is top notch. The fish are fresh and the rice is seasoned. The place is small (a sushi counter with limited number of seats).\n\nI highly recommend that anyone who appreciates good nigiri to check this place out. They offer various Omakase options (# of nigiri pieces). Each omakase also comes with a hand roll, and you are offered to try any additional pieces after your omakase ends.\n\nFriendly and attentive service. The helper kept on refilling my green tea cup.

He moved on to other projects at some exquisite traditional style Japanese spots, Ozaoza and Kappou Gomi.\n\nWe were excited to check out his humble new establishment in Japantown mall. The quality, flavors, and textures of fish were delicately crafted and exceptional, but expected given our prior Wilson encounters.\n\nWhat made this experience special was the intentionally intimate set up. In spite of being a small bar stuffed in a corner of a mall next to the staff elevator, the interaction with Wilson, Danny, and other guests in close quarters was unlike any other sushi experience I've had. The real estate was a non issue; I imagine this might resemble eating the best sushi in a subway station.\n\nWilson is the only chef behind the counter, and offers a warm and personal touch that isn't easy to deliver at a busy sushi bar where chefs are pumping out dishes for a popular establishment. Danny is a superb host who made sure everyone was well taken care of and walked this directionally-challenged damsel in distress to the restroom.\n\nGreat value, reservations required. Highly recommend dining with these gifted gentlemen and already looking forward to our next visit.", "My husband and I walked around a few times to find this place. If you're facing Andersen bakery inside Japan Center, Oma is to the left.\n\nIt's a full omakase experience. You can pick 5, 8, or 12 pieces. We initially selected an 8 piece course but my husband loves it so much that we upgraded after we were done with the first 8.\n\nThe chef did an awesome job in sequencing menu. Every course was more decadent than the next. We had: Flounder. Artic char. Blue fin tuna. Three line grunt. Yellow tail. Japanese mackerel. Chu Toro. Scallop. Toro taku temaki. Shima aji. Wild barracuda. Toro with edible gold. Uni and ikura. And complimentary miso soup to round out the meal.\n\nThe best part about Oma is that the food is straight-up delicious without any pretenses.

The prices are double what they used to be for in person.

The informed staff is happy to offer their opinion on items ranging from lobster ishiyaki bathed in bubbling white miso butter and mochi croquette filled with Hudson Valley duck and mashed potato to crunchy vegetable tempura.

From outside, you can't imagine how large the restaurant is. Unlike most restaurants, En doesn't crowd the tables next to each other, so there's a great amount of breathing room and you don't have to sit on top of the table next to you. That coupled with the soaring ceilings results in a restaurant that's trendy, but not obnoxiously loud -- I think it's great for groups and for couples' meals.\n\nIf you want to get your money's worth and get the best food En has to offer, stick to the small plates they have to offer -- avocado/tuna salad, moshi croquette (possibly the best dish in the house!), gama dofu, grilled squid, salmon rice pot with salmon roe, fried chicken, etc. And if you're going to get a yummy drink, try their mojito -- it has a unique and flavorful (girly) taste!\n\nFor the quality of food you get, I think En's very reasonably priced -- for a 3-person dinner, including 2 desserts, that left us completely full and satisfied, the tab only came to about $140 (less tip and tax).", "There is so much good Japanese food beyond sushi, and it's too bad most people don't explore outside that range.  EN Japanese Brasserie is a good place to start, then.\n\nThey make their tofu fresh every two hours -- we got it served warm right after the first batch was made at 6:00 pm, served with wari-joyu.  Soft, slippery, and the soy milk that pooled at the bottom of the box was creamy and smooth, and you could practically slurp it out the container.\n\nThe miso oden (off their winter menu) arrived still bubbling in the hot pot, full of the usual oden goodies (boiled egg, daikon, fishcakes, tofu, beef that pretty much melted in my mouth!) but the best part was probably the broth, which was just the right richness without being too heavy or thick.  I couldn't taste enough of the chicken or duck that was supposedly in the mochi croquettes, but mochi in general makes my belly happy, so no complaints.  We finished it off with the clay pot rice with salmon and salmon roe, which the waiter individually divided among the three of us, and you get to put your desired amount of salmon roe and shiso on top -- a fresh palate cleanser to finish off the dinner.", "First off, this place is pricey. Let's get that out of the way. However, if you enjoy good food and service and know what a great dining experience is, you'll enjoy this place.\n\nFirst we enjoyed the homemade tofu. It's served in a square wooden box and with a soy sauce mix for flavoring. We also had 2 sake flights and got to try different types of sakes from unfiltered to pear flavored.\n\nMy girlfriend had the braised ribs and I had the wagyu (kobe) beef. Hers was cooked tableside on a portable gas grill. Mine was also cooked tableside but on a hot stone.\n\nThe hot stone they bring out doesn't look hot or capable of cooking anything. However the waiter will instruct you on how to grease the stone using the piece of animal fat provided and then place the strips of kobe beef quickly on the stone to cook it.\n\nBesides the food being amazing here it's the service that really tops it off.\n\nThis place is fine dining but is no way snobby.

For example, I asked for spicy mayo and he politely told me they don't have any. I asked for sushi rice with my entree and he said they don't serve sushi rice as a side (only used in sushi).\n\nThe decor is very pleasant and is a good date night. Very high ceilings which I really like, open kitchen and simple plant decore.\n\nFood was excellent. Highly recommend the miso cod, garlic rice and the black sea bass nitsuke (sea bass is a must).

Had the salmon avocado roll and spicy tuna both very good!!\n\nDef recommend this restaurant!!!", "A combination of well-sourced ingredients, a balance of traditional and modern, and a top notch staff make this our go-to place for special events and visitors.  Kaiseki is always a pleasure and the smoked sashimi a visitor pleaser always.  The special dishes (edamame on the branch, fugu in season) keep regulars surprised.

All veggies were cooked to perfection, you combine them with the lamb and eat everything with your  your hands, using cr\u00eape-type rolls. putting the knife and fork aside for once was a great experience for us!\n\nAt first, the menu seems a bit pricey but once you see -and taste- the food you realize it is moderately priced.

I'm always a bit flabbergasted when I hear a new Ethiopian place has opened, because there's so much competition around and the menus are usually quite similar (especially for a vegetarian), but Tsehay distinguished itself on my first visit.\n\nI got a veggie combo platter and everything tasted really fresh. I especially liked the spicy red lentils (misir wot) and lentil/chickpea stew (shiro wot). The injera was more sour (from teff flour fermentation) than I've found at any other local Ethiopian restaurant; you might have to get used to that.\n\nThey warn you that the platter serves two. I'm not a big person and I could manage one fine by myself, with a side of lentil sambosas. Your mileage may vary.\n\nQuite dark inside with the mood lighting on.

There were so many vegan options we couldn't decide - and went for the vegan combo!\n\nIt featured two proteins:\nShiro we't (chickpea) and Misir (red lentil) Both were super delicious and flavorful! The consistency is like a dip similar to hummus.\n\nOf course it had Injera (spongy flatbread) to dip it in!\n\nIt came with many vegetable sides too! My favorites were the fossolia (string beans) and tikil gomen (cabbage & potatoes)! This spot was great!", "The food was excellent!

I got a veggie platter and just split with a friend, and we were very very full. I appreciate that the menu doesn't have too many choices because you can spend less time deciding what to eat, and more time actually eating!

You know when unassuming restaurants really blow you away? Well, this is of those spots! I've been living near this spot for a few months but was unaware of how good this restaurant was due to the fact that it doesn't stand out from the store fronts on grand street. However, I came here on a recommendation (and verified after reading a few Yelp reviews) and was satisfied with every part of my experience. We had made a reservation the day before and when we arrived we were immediately led to a table in the front of the restaurant space. This place is low lit and has wood finishes which give it a very refined and homey feel. We ordered a few cocktails which were extremely well made and after that we placed our orders for our mains. I ended up going with the garganelli pasta dish which was made with bolongnese , rosemary, and parmigano ($22). A really tasty dish that came in a modest portion amount. The service here was on point as well. Our server was extremely friendly and was fast in getting our drinks and dishes out to us. Come her if you're with a smaller group of friends (or on a date) to enjoy some quality Italian dishes, good service, and refreshing drinks!", "This place is a much welcomed establishment to Grand Street.

Vongole!", "Dined outside on a Sunday, early evening, was surprised to see people seated in the backyard as walking through the restaurant it was empty. For two people, we ordered a reasonable meal to share with the gamberetto, asparago (no egg), gemelli verde and the branzino. I just got back from Greece the night before, after eating all the beautiful Mediterranean sea eats and had to continue my sea creature indulgences.\n\nOverall the food was delicious and well prepared, although some additions could be a bit salty for some pallets. The fennel under the branzino was almost too salty to even eat but when it is pair directly with the flesh of the fish it is quite a tasty bite.\n\nWhile dining, the chef came out to greet guests (3 tables) that I assume he knew. Since the evening was quiet it would've been more homely and a nice touch to greet the others dining (2 tables) since we are all indulging.\n\nAll in all, we will come back.

Midway through our meal, it got chilly and significantly darker and we asked to move inside. They hostess had no issues and quickly moved us in. We ordered the octopus with black rice and it was perfect to split as appetizer. It tasted fine but I was not fond of the citrus taste too much in the rice. The octopus was not bad. I had the fusilli pasta -Speck black pepper, egg, and cream. The pasta noodles were perfectly al dente which I really enjoyed, a bit on the rich creamy side but not too bad, just a bit too creamy for myself.

My sister had the special pureed cauliflower and celery soup which was good.\n\nFor dinner, I recommend the salmon, Coq au Vin, or lamb shank. The julienne vegetables on the side were also delicious and very soft.

My girlfriend said her meal was average but I thought my food was great! The mussels...ON POINT in a creamy sauce. When the mussels were all done, I wanted to keep the sauce for bread dipping. I ordered one of their specials as my entree which was a seared scallop risotto...STUPENDOUS!!! The risotto was just right as far as texture and and scallops were seared perfectly and they were just the right size and not the little weird bay scallops which I'm not a fan of. I also ordered the Apple Tarte Dessert. The apples had been soaked in an Apple brandy and then baked on top of a mascarpone, in a tarte dough and then topped with vanilla ice cream...Mmmmmm!

Both were exceptional, but the bouillabaisse was incredible - rich and layered flavors, all kinds of seafood atop a julienned veggies - I almost licked the bowl.

C'mon guys, if you're trying to garner some votes, you could at least be a bit more appreciative of your customers here...\n\nI got the short rib curry, which was good though not incredible. They give you a sizeable beef rib, roughly on par with what you'd get at a barbecue place for roughly the same price (~$30) and it was tender and moist.

From the noodles, our Pad Kee Mow was one the best I've had yet for its bold flavors and heat, firm basil presence and lack of any excess greasiness.\n\nService was pretty on point as well and the atmosphere bright and welcoming.

Their fish was so tender and flaky - fell apart from just picking it up.\n\nThe dessert was really really good. It was very warm and mochi is delicious when made fresh. I asked for brown sugar on the side so that I could dip it in. The pear had red bean inside! Can't wait to try their other desserts", "Daxi Sichuan really is the most experiential way to eat Chinese food! This place is very authentic. We forgot we were even in NY! It was like we traveled to China as soon as we walked in. Super homey and welcoming. Our favorite spot to eat was by the window during Sunset. The food was super flavorful and delicious! I was also daring and had pig ear!!!!! Soooo cool!!!!! ( I enjoyed it and it was nicely presented, reminded me of chicken with a cartilage texture ). My favorite dessert was the Ice Jelly in Brown Sugar and the Seafood Crispy Rice Soup was big enough for two people. I also loved the Chinese Mushroom, nice and spicy!\nWonderful experience you guys!!!", "We saw Daxi on many recommended lists online and decided to check it out. It definitely made these lists for a reason. All of the dishes were so flavorful and delicious. The portion sizes were bigger than we expected. As a group of three we definitely over-ordered, but we couldn't help it. The interior and the plating of the food were aesthetically pleasing. Some say it could be a bit pricey but if you have more people in your party and you don't over order like we did, you can definitely split it, and it comes down to be ok.\n\nOur order:\nTibet Style Pork Ribs\nSpicy Fish w/ Boiled Pickled Cabbage in Chili Sauce\nSpicy Chicken\nSpicy Cabbage\nA cold, nonspicy, beef dish", "Came here for lunch with 6 friends and while the lines were long and service slow, they did get me a large jelly herbal drink (with some sort of crushed plum and peanut) for checking into yelp which tasted awesome. We got the crunchy pig ears as appetizer and it came with chili flakes. I also really loved their dan dan mian, which tasted so refreshing with the garlicky sauce and bean sprouts. I also loved the crispy potatoes which came with bits of sliced pork, and mapo tofu which tasted wonderful with the white rice. The chicken dunked in hot chili oil was delish, as was the sliced cucumber (super crunchy and dosed in great sauce as well). The duck was amazing. We enjoyed the atmosphere which was very elegant and asian (sort of like going to china). price was really good, we paid like $20 a person and that was for a very filling and exotic meal. Anyways, my friends and I had a wonderful time and I would be coming back.", "A lively Chinese restaurant. Great menu. Some of the latest popular dishes that you can find in China. That said, not all dishes are up to par.  At a recent dinner, we ordered steam fish with scallion and soyer sauce. It was over done. Always a good test for a busy kitchen. The restaurant is known for its Sichuan dishes. So the spicy dishes are the safe ones to order. Overall, it's a reasonable place for the price. Good decor.

SO EXCITED FOR THIS PLACE!\n\nCame today and they're in the soft opening phase, but I'm soo excited for it to officially open! Amazing vibes out here. This place is unique in that there are 3 stories, the bottom is a cafe and wine/cheese/meat market, the second is a fine dining space with private areas available, and the top level is a gorgeous terrace with amazing views of the Wharf, which I didn't get to see today because of a private event. All their cheeses/wines are directly from Italy or made in-house. Shoutout to Cory for being super friendly, welcoming, and telling us all about the place! They also have changing menus. Stopped by quickly today and grabbed a cappuccino which was on point (they use Granita coffee) and a pastry, which was also delicious. Can't wait to keep coming back here and be a regular at the cafe with windows that open up to the Wharf!\n\nI mean... I feel like I've said this in many different ways already, but I can't contain my excitement for this place", "It's a market, it's a bar - no it's a restaurant - yes it is all three.  The market has some wonderful, if not pricey,  food items from Italy.  It also sells food for take away.  The bar is the place to be for happy hour, before 6pm as they provide a food accompaniment.  The Italian spritzer was perfect way to start an evening after a hot day in DC.   In the restaurant, the pastas are all phenomenal. Tasty, seasoned perfectly, served promptly.  The branzino and eggplant was poached perfectly as well. Dessert of spumoni and sorbet were divine.   This is Nicholas Stefanelli newest restaurant;  it debuted earlier this year at the Wharf. I absolutely love his other place - Masseria and I had to see how Officina compared.  Overall, you get what you pay for - remember you are in a great location, with stunning views of the DC waterfront and that is expensive real estate.   Best wishes for success on this culinary adventure.", "I have been waiting for Officina to open for months. Until now, I haven't found a single restaurant on the Wharf that offers a truly excellent meal for an approachable price point. From the moment we entered the space the staff was friendly and accommodating. We felt like we were entering a friends house. Decor on all 3 floors is beautiful.  We had dinner on the second floor and were treated to the best pasta I've had in DC. Additionally, the duck, burrata and mushrooms all blew us away.  I noticed a different reviewer commented negatively on the \"burnt\" bread. Ummm, that would be the \"griddled\" bread and it was amaze balls - absolutely delicious!! Especially the \"burnt\" part ;). A perfect addition to the tomatoes, burrata, mozzarella, or, on on its own. And, it was complementary my friend!!\nAgain, I need to shout out to the staff who were all so incredibly friendly. From the bussers who were eager to please, to our knowledgable waiter, and even the manager who stopped more than once to check on us.\nI can't wait to go back for lunch on the first floor and a shopping trip to the Italian Market on the first floor!", "Warning: If you build a restaurant around an open kitchen, you shouldn't fill said kitchen with poorly-trained, confused looking young workers who seem to be in a perpetual panic and don't prepare the same dish consistently throughout the evening. It's a bad look.\n\nThe food at Officina is fine, but we have no desire to return (except for a worthy sandwich at the cafe). But the restaurant? It's a high-volume food factory charging chef-driven prices for simple peasant food. What's the fuss about?\n\nSimple items like charcuterie, marinated olives, and pasta carbonara or cacio e pepe are executed well.\n\nAttempts at anything more complex have been either ill-advised or poorly executed: overcooked veggies, under-seasoned entrees, overdressed salads. Move along...", "I'm staying at the new Hilton hotel at Washington Mall and walked over to try this place. It was amazing!! Started with prosciutto and melon which was incredible. The melon was marinated and every bite was bursting with flavor. Then I had the Bucatini and it was amazing. At first I thought the portion was small but it was so rich and flavorful that as I ate it....I found it was perfect. I finished with some fresh made gelato. A cream flavor with shaved dark chocolate and it was heavenly! I sat at the bar and the service was great and my server had me try a taste of their signature drink (specific to Italy) which was a wonderful way to finish my meal. I don't know why yelp reviews aren't higher because I loved everything about it and will be back next time I'm here for business!!", "What a wonderful experience Wednesday evening on the riverfront in DC! We were seated quickly, and never rushed in our over 3 hour stay. The charcuterie and starter selection, while not expansive, is all quite tasty, and the wine list ensures that you'll be able to find both the taste & value you're looking for. Our wine selection was not available, but the sommelier recommended a replacement bottle that was just as good (and a small bit cheaper!).\n\nAs with the best Italian restaurants, the secondi and main courses are where you can truly see the chef's work shine, and Officina is no different. Squid ink pasta, tender gnocchi and a sublime grilled seafood plate presents with tastes across the spectrum...each one not overpowering, but delicious in its' own way.\n\nThe gelato (made in house) is a wonderful way to wrap up your experience (and the sweet corn flavor is both surprising and quite tasty). What really made the night complete was a visit to the rooftop bar, with very nice views of the waterfront and an excellent bar staff.", "We picked up the picnic basket to go from their Georgetown pop up location and it was so yummy and really fun!

Do not miss the pork belly biscuits as they are perfect little things that could float off the plate with their lightness and savory goodness. Then on to the little gem salad, which you would expect to be snoozy but instead was a work of art. Super fresh with some lovely beet velvet underneath and generous enough for three to share. Who is putting this stuff together in the kitchen? OMG. We shared the roasted wild mushrooms and the grilled corn dish--two more winners.

Having a bite of each type of pasta with all different sauces were amazing and glad we didn't just order one type and miss out on all of the goodness.\n\nThe last dish we enjoyed was the buttermilk fried chicken thighs w/the vinegar hot sauce and a side of the caraway yogurt.

You walk into this vast cafeteria and get the sense you're about to be rushed into ordering and eating. And that's true, but make no assumptions about the food quality. It's quite good. The presentation is like that of a family gathering for 4th of July with paper plates and styrofoam drinking cups.\n\nDosas and samosas are filled tight with potatoes and spice.\n\nEating in takes a lot away from the experience from eating the delicious food though, so I would recommend taking it home.

There are a few chalkboard signs scattered around that tell you your ordering options: on their app, on their website, or call and place your order. We were about to place an order on their website, but it said to call as well to confirm your order... so we just called to order. There's a window for pickup on Channing, separate from the market and on the opposite side of the building as the parking lot.\n\nThere are picnic tables near the market entrance in the parking lot, so we ended up eating there.\n\nAll the logistics/confusion aside, food was good! We shared the masala dosa - inside seemed similar to what you'd find in a samosa, and one of the chicken curry lunch specials.", "I'm not usually a fan of Indian food (unless my grandmother made it!) but I think I have found the next best thing!  Vik's Chaat offer the least greasy, heavy, overly spiced options of my favorite dishes in the area.  I really liked the Cholle Bhature (which is one of my favorites, ever) and its done so well!!  I wish I had time and enough room to try: Mix Veg Pakoras, Pani Puri, Dahi Papdi Chaat!  The mango lassi is really thick and amazing, and I am tempted to come back and try and rose lassi next time!\n\nServing sizes are big enough to share (most of the time) and I always think eating family style is the best way to try everything that tempts you on the menu!\n\nI really like the new layout - order first and wait to pick up at different stations along the back wall.  I think it makes for fast, convenient, fresh service!", "Nestled in a warehouse area that doesn't look like anything good could possibly be going on inside is Vik's Chaat. It has a market with things my Rooney's mom brought us from India when she visited. So it's obv legit.\n\nWalk around the corner and it's the Indian cafeteria scene. I've seen this other places here. It's loud and busy and the food options are more limited than they look. It's easier than it looks. I went for the ol' what's good here? to the cashier. He took me in an entirely different direction with some fried fish situation. You guys, I could eat this fish for the rest of my life. Lightly breaded, fantastically spiced with a little heat and perfectly seasoned.\n\nThe dessert case is extensive. But that wasn't happening that day. Next time. Definitely a next time!", "It's not the same quality of food which we used to get few years back. Ordered paapdi chat. - it sucked. Ordered plate of Samosa for 9 $ yep 9$ for 2 samosa where u could have got better quality for 4$ in any chat place in Bay Area. Moreover they have jacked up prices across the board which doesn't make sense as quality of the food has gone worst. .\nFalooda with ice cream - please don't even order.\n\nBottom line they have lot of variety but quality is not good.

Good thing is that there is a parking garage in the building with free parking for the first 90 minutes.\nNow for Stellina, which has a very fresh clean atmosphere with some quirkyness and whimsy. The dining room is relatively small with a combination of counter seating, bar top tables, and seated tables. Most of the kitchen is open so you can see pizzas and salads being prepared. The food selection is casual but wow... so yummy! We tried the frito misto appetizer, a pasta with ragu (paccheri all'avellinese), and a pizza, (cacaio & pepe). The frito misto was light and airy with just enough crisp but didn't overwhelm the ingredients. The pizza was highlighted by oh so delicious cheese and a chewy flavorful dough. The ragu was the star of the pasta dish with layers of wine and rich tomatoes hitting your tastebuds at different points. The service was very friendly and cheerful. My one somewhat negative thought is that with food this good, they really need a bigger dining room! All in all an exceptional experience. We can't wait to go back.", "Well.  Definately not coming back here.  Forget about what the food taste like, I did not even get that far, and it's not like I don't like to try new things,  but I was not impressed.  I walked in and the dining room iis an upscale take out joint with loud music, nice but the menu was confusing and this is not the area for this type of venue.  The staff walked around but was not available to assist, you had to walk up to the register to order your meal like a take out restaurant, with triple the price for fancy meat and cheese on dough.   Then when your pizza came out the darn thing was not even cut.  They brought you a slicer to cut it your self.  No customer service, no help with the menu. Oh before I forget free water on the table. Stay away, stay far far away and save your money.  No one wants to work this hard for pizza at lunch time.  Maybe if you are on date and want to make an impression then this might work.", "Came here as part of a group for a conference that was in town. The place looks unassuming for a restaurant that has a Michelin star! The food is amazing, if you're looking for a great twist on  Neapolitan pizza, than you won't be disappointed. The pizzas come out quick, cooked in a brick oven with thin and chewy crusts cooked to perfection. The pasta dishes are also just as legit, I came back to this place twice during my visit because I got food envy the first time around and had to try it all! Service is all through the app, and turn around time is quick; I didn't have to wait for seating either time I went. Keep in mind they automatically charge you a service fee of 20% on your orders though.", "Chef Matteo Venini has truly demonstrated his passion for \"real Italian food\"; along with Antonio Matarrazo they have truly delivered an inviting atmosphere which is warm and casual. Our family truly enjoyed the atmosphere, but most importantly THE FOOD! It was one of those rares in which Adults and Children (including picky eaters) all had faces of gusto as we had fried artichokes and cod. The Pizza though, was authentic Italian. I understand if people might be expecting New York Style or Chicago Deep Dish as \"Authentic Italian\". I am a fan of both styles. Authentic Italian consists of a crispy savory dough with a tasty sauce and fresh ingredients... I would recommend that everyone just go... try some pizza drink some wine and have some fun with friends! Salute!", "Whoa!\n\nOne of their appetizers, carciofo all romana (fried artichokes), really knocked my socks off. It's crunchy and creamy all at the same time; and beautiful to look at too. If you like artichoke, don't miss it. I'm still dreaming about it.\n\nThe Schiacciata pizza is unique and noteworthy. Its base is a lovely white sauce, covered with several mortadella slices, a heap of stracciatella di bufala (cheese) and a light sprinkling of pistachios here and there.\n\nMy dinner companions informed me that I was speaking fluent Italian after eating such deliciousness.\n\nBen fatto, Stellina.", "I need a Stellina Pizzeria in NYC! Just spent a week in DC and happened to pop in for takeout my first night because everything else was closed, ended up going again my last day because it was my favorite meal of the week.\n\nOffers outdoor dining and very friendly service, serves incredible pizzas all with a thin flavorful crust that's perfectly oven-blistered and satisfyingly chewy and topped with high-quality ingredients. My favorites are the margherita and picante pizzas.\n\nI'd say one pizza could serve one very hungry or determined pizza eater, but otherwise it's good for 1.5 people (or two delicate eaters).

They are known for their seafood but in addition to getting amazing seafood they also have an amazing steak. My husband used to be the kind of person that would go to Gibson's or Ruth Chris for a night out and loves steak. I love a good steak too. What's surprising about Nico is they have this exceptional aged rib eye that is just outstanding. That coupled with the fantastic service, great wine and cocktails... it is one of our go to places. If you can, get a seat at the bar in front of the kitchen. It's fun to see them make the food and in many ways is more intimate that the regular tables. And the hotel is great too. It's inside the Thompson Hotel.", "I was afraid that my expectation would outweigh reality here, even though I know that One Off knows exactly what they're doing and they're basically infallible. And Nico Osteria lived up to all the hype. We had the Kanpachi crudo- the texture of the fish was incredible and the flavors were clean and simple; the grilled octopus was delicious, even if the bread in this dish was actually the star; the pork loin came with olives I actually liked (!!!!); the stuffed papardelle I had to pry away from my father and was absolutely perfect; the garganelli I'd never heard of before, but was this amazing little rolled pasta with the most wonderful texture ever; and the poached sturgeon with the creme fraiche melted over top made me want to lick the plate.\n\nOh and the dessert- my god the dessert! I'm such a dessert snob, but I knew that Amanda Rockman would blow me away. And she did. I got the Monte Bianco, which I dissected on my plate to figure out exactly how it was made, and then I proceeded to inhale the whole thing at a pretty impressive rate.\n\nI'm really tempted to come back here and just order the rest of the dessert menu. I cannot wait to go back.", "As fans of Paul Kahan, we were excited to check out his newest spot (one of only a few great restaurant options on rush street). Overall, we felt that Niko was stuck somewhere between a generic hotel lounge and a unique eclectic restaurant. Most of the food was great -- especially both of the whole fish options (MUST try), and the pasta, which was clearly fresh and offered unique flavors (we got the butternut squash ravioli and the clam dish). A few of the dishes, however (especially the Indiana shrimp) were simply not good.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed Niko but felt that it was WAY too pricey for the experience that was delivered. With all of the fantastic Italian small plate options out there, Niko may be perfect for a special occasion, but not worth the price tag otherwise when dozens of similar but less expensive spots are at our finger tips in Chicago.", "My friend and I were seated by the amiable and helpful host Joe, who sat at the counter right in front of a beautiful swordfish. I think this spot was the best in the house. We could see the upstairs chefs (most of the cooking is done in a basement kitchen) busily and were in the midst of all the servers and staff at work. At this place, service reigns supreme. Everyone from the aforementioned host to restauranteur Donny (who gladly chatted us up for a bit) went above and beyond. The food was fantastic too. I loved their take on bruschetta and raw bar for starters, squid ink pasta and steak for entrees. The house made soda and desserts were excellent too. To top it off, this might be the most beautiful restaurant I've been to. It melds seamlessly with the hotel lobby and the Gold Coast itself.", "We went here on a whim last nigh while in Chi-Town...  That decision turned an already great day into an amazing one.  \n\nFirst off, our bartender Michael was outstanding. He recommended some amazing drinks for my wife and his knowledge of bourbons (and his beard) made him a very interesting to talk with.  Lol.   Just a good dude who happened to be an outstanding bartender.  \n\nI knew out of the gates that I was going to order the Rigatoni Ragu. But, Michael also highly endorse the Big Eye tuna and stuffed pappardelle.  Both were delicious, but The Big Eye Tuna is up there with the best things I ever ate.  \n\nThe Rigatoni Ragu was hands down the best I've has since my wife and I were in Florence last summer...and that was the most amazing pasta dish I ever ate...and I grew up in Long Island.  When it comes to Ragu, my motto is now Northern Italy or bust.  They let the flavor of the meat do the talking....it's not used as an accent to a sea of tomato sauce.  \n\nCheck out Nico.  You won't be disappointed.", "Nico Osteria in the Gold coast is golden! This was my first time here and they hit it out of the park!  The service was good, the place looks amazing but the true star here was the food.  Ever dish from the crudo, lobster spaghetti, smoke whitefish traiangolini to even the brussel sprouts were simply delicious.  They call themselves a Italian Seafood restaurant but the Nico Ribeye was as good as any big name Chicago steakhouse can deliver.  \n\nMy only complaint was that the booth style tables along the windows are cramped.  We had to request a different table to fit our group better.  We watched several other customers sit at the booths than ask to be seated at a table were they could sit comfortably.  I hope they can fix this problem soon but in the meant time I would recommend requesting a table on your reservation.  I also love the seat at the bar that overlooks the open kitchen but was told they are sometimes reserved and sometimes first come first serve.

The lobster salad (was supposed to be a lobster roll, but they had run out of bread) was amazing.\n\nOverall, we both really enjoyed our experience and will come back again.

We've ordered 2 of each of the 12 items on the raw menu and loved everything. I followed up with extra Conway Cup oysters and Cherrystone Clams as I especially liked those two kinds.

Not sure why.\n\nMussels on the other hand weren't impressive at all. The broth was too salty and had too many ingredients/flavors in it.\n\nThe wines by glass weren't great either. We've tried 2 of 3 available whites and one red.\n\nInterior design is very impressive but the supermarket across the street with bright lights shining into the windows kills the views out of the window and makes outside seating less attractive. There was a funky aroma (a wet dog kind - I actually like dogs, so I was fine with it :) near the bar/restroom area.\n\nService was Ok until it got busy and the only waitress was obviously stretched.\n\nI'd come back for the raw bar and steak tartare.

But once I went in for my early dinner with mom there was a nice vibe. We were seated promptly. Ordered 2 happy hour beers and an order of oysters Rockefeller which were great.  They were cleaned well and wasn't too oily or salty.  The only complaint I might have about the oysters are that it was too small in size and portion.  I ordered for entree seafood soup and modules frites.  Both tasted fresh and was a good portion for the price. The soup of the mussels was so good, came with frites, sooo good. The seafood soup had a delicious tomato soup base that tasted fresh and not sour like a lot of tomato soups does. The waitress offered chewy bread to sop up all the yummy soup.

We had several appetizers: steak tartare, lamb sausage, octopus, fries, and a mushroom gratin. It was all pretty great, but the standout was definitely the octopus, which was perfectly tender.\n\nI had one of their specialty cocktails, which featured tequila and St. Germain (delicious), as well as a glass of cava. The BF had a couple of Manhattan cocktails.\n\nI've also been in during brunch, and the bartenders make a superb bloody mary.\n\nThe space itself is very cool, with loads of vintage charm. If you use the bathroom, take note of the toilet paper holder and the light fixture over the sink.

The food was ok. I ordered the seafood stew which was no stew, It wasn't even a soup! The seafood was cooked good but it was in a bland broth and there wasn't much in the bowl. I ordered the added lobster and don't mind paying extra for it but overall it wasn't worth it! I paid way too much for the price for what the dish was actually worth. The waitress had an slight attitude and never brought the bread I asked for! I left still hungry, felt overcharged, and mislead by what the meal was supposed to be and what I actually got!

We waited, we had to dine late... but who cares when the food and service are impeccable!?  I could only explain it by stating that this is the food that the angels serve you in heaven!  My husband had the chicken marsala and asked for garlic to be added.  The server explained that the sauce is a sweet sauce however he passed my husband's request along to the chef.  The marsala not only came to him with garlic added... but whole cloves of \"roasted\" garlic!  As busy as it was, they still took the time to cater to a specific request!  I tried the lobster ravioli special with slices of tender asparagus and a roasted red pepper sauce... just magic... rich, creamy, with the taste of \"freshly made from scratch\" in every bite!  The very next night we decided to try their sister restaurant... Rosebud on Rush.... I will put a separate review on that particular restaurant's yelp review area as well!  ROSEBUD was suggested to us by a server at a steakhouse we were patronizing... and when I asked where she goes for authentic Italian she didn't even hesitate \"Rosebuds!\"... she was correct!", "What a quaint restaurant! Excellent meal of Italian wedding soup followed by one of the day's specials - a delicious homemade lobster ravioli with shrimp.  Finished with a slice of carrot cake. Everything was so fresh and homey - and in portions too large to finish!", "The original \"Rosebud\" of Chicago's Little Italy--did not disappoint!  The vibes were lowkey, intimate and traditional.  I enjoyed the Chicken Vesuvio (a dish that originated in Chicago) and it was delicious!  The portion size was impressive and gave me a run for my money.  (It was 4 chicken breasts in a white wine sauce, topped with an immense amount of peas, and long cut Idaho potatoes.)\n\nThe bartender served me in a timely fashion and provided me with complimentary bread to start my meal, which was paired with freshly shredded Parmesan cheese!  I expected olive oil or butter to accompany the bread but was not offered any.  (Not a problem)\n\nMy water was filled without my having to ask or remind the bartender and that attention to detail is most appreciated when considering where to eat in the vast locale of local eateries!\n\nI would return and I recommend this location to anyone looking for delicious Italian authenticity in the heart of Little Italy!\n\n-CAJ", "Full disclosure.

All of the service from the staff is stellar.\n\nI am pretty sure that by now each item on the menu has been enjoyed by someone in my party and there have never been complaints. Of course, the items that tend to frequent my table are the sausage & peppers, any one of their homemade pasta dishes (of course my favorite Cavatelli al Forno) & their fabulous tiramisu is a must to conclude any meal here.", "I always feel like a little kid when I go here - the dark atmosphere, everything is wood, the old school windows, oh, and I always order spaghetti and meatballs.\nThis is good Italian fair, nothing that is going to blow your mind, but the pasta and vodka sauce is delicious, as are the square noodles and the ravioli.\nThe meatballs are fantastic, and are the size of a baseball, if not larger.

I then had  the lobster boil which came with asparagus a refreshing change from the traditional corn on the cob. The lobster was sweet and everything was perfectly cooked. My husband had the East Coast Pan Roast~ mussels, steamers, shrimp, squid, and the daily catch in a spicy tomato sauce,he really wanted to pick up the plate and lick it (but i won't let him) he said it was very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. For desert i had chocolate pudding with fresh berries and cream, not the best i ever had but good (a little to soupy and to sweet) My husband had the warm berry cobbler with ice cream and he said it was really good.\nWe will definitely be back!! thanks farmer and the fish for a wonderful meal!!!", "This place deserves more then 5 stars... This place is so cozy romantic and quant... It's farm to table and its located in an old house. They have their own garden and a cute little shop in the back where you can buy local eggs, fish, meat, herbs, (chocolate) milk, etc... This place is located in Purdys, kind of in the\nMiddle\nOf no where. Which makes this place even more enjoyable. It's so luscious  land adorable that I'm enquiring my engagement dinner here... This place isn't for the faint of heart so if you don't enjoy fresh seafood, but they do have a great selection of wine, cocktails and beer. So you can sit back by the fire enjoy a cocktail and eat peanuts where you can throw the shells right on the floor! Did I mention they supply all the fresh fish to local restaurants in NYC?

We were seated on time, as per our reservation. A bit cramped, but the place is small. What was most frustrating was there were four items from the menu that were not available. There was only enough soup left for ONE person at our table to get clam chowder. We were also told that they were out of the salmon, tuna and cod. Disappointed, but we  move on to other things. I didn't love my lobster roll. The  hot dog bun seemed stale. I don't know, I just wasn't wow'd for sure and I was expecting to be.\nThe kicker was when we were in the middle of eating, the table next to us was served tuna. ALL three of them at the table. We laughed about it by that point, but they told us that we didn't miss anything.\nThe staff was very nice, accommodating and attentive. Just wish that more items were available from an already limited menu for a dinner that was not at a late hour.", "Love this place! It is an old historic farm house situated on an existing farm! Right up my alley. The menu includes tons of fish and oyster options. I had the lobster roll which was just delicious! They have a great selection of beers and wines. Next time I go I will stop in the farm stand they have next door to the restaurant to check out their goods. This place is a gem and a must try if you are in the area.", "You don't earn 5 stars for mediocre food, ambience and service- so needless to say this is a 5 + star experience.  On the recommendation of a friend, my favorite foodie with the in laws and I made our way to the landmark farmhouse in Purdy's ,NY. Everything and I mean everything was absolutely splendid.\nThe food: For starters we had the Purdy's  clam chowder, dozen little necks (on a scale from 1-10; 11+ for freshness) and the rock shrimp (delicious).  Entree: cold lobster roll, fish n chips and the special dover sole (filet at the table). Dessert: white chocolate bread pudding with salted caramel chocolate ice cream. I honestly can't remember a time that I totally and thorough enjoyed everything served (and I tasted a little of each dish).\nThe history of the farmhouse is also a wonderful treat as the ambience's authenticity is cozy and inviting yet they have a lively bar too. Do stop at the farm shop on your way out and take home some of the freshest fish.\nLastly, our server-Audrey was a delight and like our meal she gave 5+service.", "Love this place! Amazing ambiance, fresh fish, and stays open late. I love a good raw bar and they have more options than I even knew existed! I've had great oyster recommendations every time! I love that they serve fresh seasonal greens directly from their garden. My only complaint is that there is no where to wait when it gets crowded, as the bar area is very narrow. It gets uncomfortably packed, and last time I went, even once seated my table was so close to the bar that I had people practically standing over me as I was eating dinner. I know there's not much to be done about a crowd, (and a crowd means good food!) but this does take away from the experience. My recommendation...go on a weeknight when they are open late if you can. Weekends are just too packed, and even with reservations you'll have to wait.", "Service was outstanding, food was eclectic, atmosphere was comfortable and intimate.

Walking into Wayfare Tavern, I was head over heels.

Handmade giant buttery and flaky popovers came out within seconds. The best complimentary \"bread\" course to date.  Period.  After we devoured the savory baked goods, grilled Calamari with crispy polenta and a chorizo tomato jam was the beginning of our lavish meal.  Chris' Filet Mignon made with shallot confit, bone marrow bordelaise, fresh marjoram and crispy torpedo onion was flawlessly cooked with a medium rare temp and the most fantastic fixings to ever accompany a prime cut of steak.  It cut like butter and was so diverse in rich, fragrant flavors.  Saving the best part for last- my Organic Fried Chicken, prepared with a buttermilk brine and fried to perfection with roasted garlic, lemon and an abundance of woody herbs was a mound of meat I'd deem magical.  Yes, this fried chicken was that good.  Bravo Chef Florence, Bravo.", "It's a shame that I can't rate the food from this restaurant, because I have yet to dine here.

That, and the ambiance is superb, with mahogany and dark colors prevailing. Normally I opt for one of the healthiest options on the menu, but today I went for the chef's special: fried chicken. This is seriously the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. The herbal concoction in the batter is blended to perfection. It comes with no sides or greens, so I ordered a side dish of broccoli, which I also recommend. It is topped with slices of parm. You won't be disappointed, unless you expect a light check at the end of the meal. Unless you can eat most of a whole chicken, I suggest splitting the chicken dish with your dining mate.

Whether you\u2019re sipping a cocktail while snacking on Urfa chili drumsticks at the bar, or savoring lamb pav\u00e9 matched with roasted pineapple and blue corn tortillas, dining here is a global tour de force.

Awarded the Bib Gourmand by Michelin, Canon offers the highest quality and value.\n\nFood - Oher restaurants in town should aspire to prepare food half as good as Canon's. Chef Brad Cecchi has hit a home-run with this shareable seasonal fare. The menu is broken into three categories: quick bites, small plates and platters. Dependent on the size of your group I recommend trying at least one item from each section. We stopped in for dinner on Friday night and had the Tots, Chicken Drumsticks and New York Strip. The drumsticks have been on the menu since Canon opened and are unbelievably good. Apparently the secret to making gourmet tater tots is adding mole and stacking them into a pyramid.\n\nAmbience - Located in a residential area in East Sacramento, if didn't know it was there you'd probably drive right by it. Be that as it may once you walk in you're greeted with a very elegant and intimate space. The high wood ceiling and open kitchen highlight the design.\n\nService - I'm pleased to say that the service was first-class. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Sitting across from the kitchen it was evident how smooth the kitchen was running. Perhaps the most coolest part of this experience was watching the owner clean up tables and converse with guest.", "Went to Canon on a Tuesday night after work, and it was packed!!! Next available table was an hour wait.  Fortunately, we got seats at the bar within 15 mins. So pro tip: make a reservation\n\nWe tried a few of the shareable plates:\n**Chicken drumstick (4.5/5)\nReally tasty, I love the sauce. Has a Mediterranean/moroccan flavor\n\n**Tots (5/5)\nYummy yummy!! These are the best tots I've ever had. Nice amount of crispiness\n\n**Burger (4/5)\nThe bartender warned us that the cheese would be stinky but my nose didn't catch anything. It was juicy and the bun was soft. (It kinda reminded me of empress tavern but I'll still give em the edge) I'm surprised that such an expensive burger has nothing on the side?! I want some chips or fries please lol\n\n**Oysters (3.5/5)\nAahhh meh nothing too special here\n\nThe ambiance is nice with tall ceilings. Hipstery vibe.

But, finally, the stars aligned last night and we my wife and I along with some good friends were able to enjoy a night out. Canon did not disappoint and meet my very high expectations. There was literally nothing we ordered that we did not like, and we ordered nearly everything. Stand outs for me were the pork belly chop and the tuna platter. My wife could live off the sweet potato bravas. Cocktails were clever, creative and delicious. Great service, friendly staff, cool space. I have nothing bad to say.\n\nNot getting to get out as much as we might like to, it is always nice when the restaurant we pick is a slam dunk and Canon was an absolute slam dunk.\nWe will be celebrating many a special occassion at Canon in the future I suspect.", "I've been here three times now with my friend who is Celiac since they are known to be careful to avoid gluten cross contamination.\n\nThis is an upscale place that is primarily by reservation and if you don't have a reservation you might not get a table.

The last time I went they also specified that they use a separate fryer for the gluten-free items.\n\nAs a vegan, my favorite things on the menu are the vegetables and the vegan desserts. On my last visit, I tried the crispy root vegetables, Brussels sprouts, and sweet potato bravas (with the aioli on the side for my friend). Some of the best preparation of vegetables that I've had in recent memory are from here.\n\nThe cocktails on the other hand I feel like are overpriced and I would not come here for cocktails alone. I tried the Zero cocktail last time and did not feel like it was worth $14.\n\nIf they came out with a separate vegan menu, then I would definitely come more frequently.", "One of the best new restaurants in Sacramento.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I came here for brunch on a Saturday morning. From the moment we walked in, we knew we would love the place. From the crown molding, to the exposed wood beam ceilings, to the contrasting deep blue and white color scheme, the decor was top notch. Simple, elegant, and warm.\n\nOn to the food. We ordered the Frank's Special (fried rice with chicken), ricotta pancakes, and smoked trout hash. Each dish was fantastic. The Frank's Special tasted strongly of ginger and peppers, and came with a fried chicken drumstick that was pull off the bone tender with a satisfyingly crunchy skin. The ricotta pancakes were airy and lemony, without being too sweet; nor were they drenched in heavy syrup, butter, or compote. The smoked trout hash had perfectly crunchy potatoes that didn't get soggy as the meal progressed, and was topped with salted fish eggs that perfectly complimented the dish.\n\nAll dishes as Canon are meant to be shared, and we ended up with ample leftovers for an afternoon snack. We can't wait to return for dinner, and a night out on the large patio when the weather's nice.", "Big step up from their soft opening that I attended way back when.  For starters, there are cushions on the outdoor patio seats!  Game changer for my butt.\n\nNow that I can sit comfortably, I found the food to be significantly better too.  We split the summer peaches, ribs, tots, beer can chicken and everything tasted very refined.

So to Sushi-Ann I went for lunch on a busy pre-holiday weekday.....\n\nIt's a relatively quiet corner of Midtown near Rockefeller Center, so there's not too much going on along this stretch of 51st. The service here is very amiable and helpful, akin to most eatery service in Japan. Unlike a lot of sushi places in San Francisco, it was refreshing to feel a more authentic vibe in the air with Japanese staff and sushi chefs. I was even presented with a nice warm towel before my meal to freshen up; made me feel just a little nostalgic for Japan.\n\nI went for the $35 Sushi Lunch Set: a bowl of miso soup, green salad with ginger dressing, assorted sushi pieces/rolls, and ice cream (which comes in three flavors). Although the food was all pretty standard when it comes to Japanese places, the atmosphere and presentation made it all taste that much better. The sushi was fresh and smooth, staying true to the raw slices of fish and not overdoing it with the fusion rolls.\n\nI'd like to come back here again, but next time I'll come back with more people.", "The sushi here is fantastic. Yes, it is pricey but you get what you pay for.\n\nI always sit at the bar and order the omakase, starting with some sashimi. At the bar, you get the best neta and you can tell the chef what you like/don't like as the course goes on.\n\nThe quality of the fish is fantastic and the chef always tells you the source so you know what you are eating. The pieces are just the right size and the rice is perfect - doesn't fall apart in your hands but does in your mouth and you can feel each rice grain. It is edomae style and most of the time, you don't need to use any soy sauce or add wasabi to what the chef prepared for you. Truly one of the best places I've had sushi outside of Japan.", "We called the restaurant at 11:15 a.m. for a lunch reservation at 12pm on the same day and were told that we must be done by 12:45 p.m.\n\nSushi Deluxe comes with 8 pieces of nigiri, 6 pieces of tuna roll and 2 pieces of california roll.  Everything was good, but not outstanding. The only thing that stood out and memorable was the akagai (arc shell clam). The rice tasted a little dry and didn't have enough flavor.  While everything was fresh and the presentation was nice, you get the feeling that they reserve the top quality stuff at a higher price point.  However, the $28 they charged for what we received isn't a particularly cheap price, and it is certainly possible to find other sushi places in the area that offers better quality for a similar price.\n\nThe service was good and efficient, and we finished our food by the 12:45 p.m.", "Have you ever walked into a restaurant and immediately knew you were in for a treat? This experience occurred to me at Sushi-Ann.

I commented how this restaurant reminded me of the sushi shops in Ginza, Tokyo.\n\nWe had a no nonsense work lunch in and out in one hour. Started with Maine Uni, sweet shrimp, o-toro, hotate from Hokkaido, hamachi, saba, and maguro. The green tea was Japanese hot, like I am some samurai warrior, instead of someone who gets manicures. haha.\n\nThe restaurant is centrally located on E51st Street, near St Bart's and some really amazing shopping/hotels nearby.\n\nBook lunch and get there on time.

Ordered two rolls, salad and glass of wine.  Salmon roll was fine, but the first bite of the spicy tuna roll nearly made me vomit - tasted like rotten fish.  I didn't eat another bite of my food, requested the check (they took the tuna roll off) and left.  They offered to make me something else, but I politely declined.  I will not go back.  By far the worst bite of sushi I can recall eating, and will definitely keep me off sushi for a while.", "The perfect sushi restaurant, like a bit of Tokyo in New York. Top quality fish, artfully presented, authentic, with traditional attention to the seasons, and many species flown in from Japan. They are packed at lunch, and aren't open late, so an early dinner is the most tranquil time, before the best fish runs out. An interesting sake menu, attentive servers, and some of the best sushi chefs in town, but without the ego and overinflated prices.

I'm glad we did because it ended up being my favorite dish. It's not too salty but has tons of flavor. The meat and shrimp inside are super plump and tender.\n\nThe combination chow mein on the other hand, was not as great. It was good, but tasted mostly of soy sauce.\n\nThe beef noodle soup was good, but not great. My husband preferred this over the fried rice, but it tasted a little on the sweet side for me. I guess I'm just not used to having beef noodle soups being sweet. Again, it wasn't bad, just not phenomenal.\n\nOverall it was a pleasant experience. Nothing over the top but I'd definitely come back in the future to try more things on the menu.", "The food was ok. They charged the two of us $3 for rice to go with $30 of food, which is fine, except it wasn't even a full bowl of rice each! Come on! What kind of Chinese restaurant makes you feel like you were shorted on rice? Most places, an order of rice is enough for two people but one each was not enough here. They gave us free dessert soup, which was ok, but I'd rather just have enough rice to go with my meal.\n\nService wise, they have some things to work out, but it's a soft opening. Everything we ordered except for the rice showed up and we were still waiting for the rice and had to ask for it a few times. They tried to give us dessert twice but we declined.\n\nThe eggplant was decent and was about $10. The pork knuckle is pretty good if you like fatty connective tissue. There's not much muscle meat on it though, so for about $19, probably a dish I should just make myself for far less.", "This place used to be some kind of fusion restaurant.\nI liked that place but interior of this place is very nicely changed.

I think the Izzo tasted better and they were cheaper (Groupon!) We also ordered shrimp fried rice l, walnut shrimp and beef stir fry. The fried rice was okay, shrimp was a bit soggy and the beef was flavorful and spicy.  This place is way over price for mediocre food. We paid around $90 for 6 take out dishes. The restaurant did a lot of remodeling with fancy traditional oriental Decor..I felt like I was in an old Chinese soap opera movie. Maybe that's why the food costs so much.

The baguette was to die for and totally worth the $4 since I couldn't wait in line for an hour to buy it myself at Tartine Bakery and the house made butter paired so well with it. The salad was doused in delicious olive oil and seasoned perfectly. Both pastas were cooked perfectly but the spaghetti with tomatoes was definitely the winner (and I love seafood pasta).

Try as the other restaurants might, I'm almost certain they'll never match the offerings at this Sausalito standby.\n\nDisclaimer:\nI have tried and do not like ama ebi (sweet prawn with eyes attached) or nigiri or sashimi that looks too much like silvery fish. Maguro and sake (salmon) are yummy colors like bright red and orange, whereas silver is not a yummy color. Just a personal hangup that informed my orders.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, very intimate but with a hint of trendy, and its bar was actually impressive. I don't often get bellinis with sushi, but it worked here. My guy and I have something of a routine down with sushi -  tuna and salmon nigiri, along with rainbow, spider, dragon and/or crunch roll. These regular favorites were not-so-regular at Sushi Ran, where the fish is fresh, the colors are bold, the chefs are friendly and the crunch roll was to die for.\n\nSushi Ran transcends the look and feel of the run-of-the-mill sushi joint and turns it into a real dining experience: for a price.

The restaurant was busy but our waitress made sure we had plenty of attention and service. To start off, we shared a bottle of wine and a half bottle to champagne. After dissecting the menu for some time we ordered the creamy scallop roll, kaisen futo-maki, chu toro (blue fin fatty tuna), shuma aji (striped jack), amaebi (sweet shrimp), umi masu (tasmanian trout), wagyu, ahi poke, and the kobe beef carpaccio.\n\nFor dessert? We shared a dessert sampler which is a selection of small bites from their dessert menu. Our waitress talked us into trying their apricot panna cotta- great choice! We finished it to the bottle of the cup!\n\nI couldn't ask for a better birthday dinner. I left with a full stomach, and cousin with an empty wallet.", "The sushi chefs seem to think mighty highly of themselves.  Not a stitch of traditional Japanese humility here - a couple of Chinese sushi chefs and a couple of Japanese American guys who would be *lost* culturally in Japan because of their haughty and \"I'm so cool\" attitudes.\n\n\\Nonetheless, the sushi in the main room is always fresh, always stellar.  I was extremely disappointed (mad?) that when dining at the counter at the wine bar this last visit, we ordered a Unagi Hand roll with avocado and cucumber - and it arrived (a) with the seaweed wrap totally soggy (the reason you order a handroll as opposed to a regular \"maki\" is to enjoy the texture variance between the crisp seaweed and the soft rice and fish filling, and then (b) when we made mention of this to the bartender, he didn't do squat about it.  What could he have done?  Apologize, ask the sushi maker to comment, offer a complimentary roll the next visit?  \n\nOur favorite dishes outside the sushi are the squid tentacles with the special house spicy mayonnaise, the 4-part veggie special (last time, a curried butternut squash, garlic and chili-spiked spinach, roasted potatoes, and velvety grilled eggplant), and tempura to even make the Ten-Inchi in the Ginza in Tokyo weep.", "I just discovered Sushi Ran, and it absolutely rocks! I can't wait to go back.\n\nSome of the highlights: the small dishes (aside from the sushi rolls, etc.) My friend and I got the smoked hamachi tataki (smoked hamachi, grapefruit, avocado, and some yummy sauce). It was so good that we finished off every last drop of the sauce by dunking our sushi rolls into it.\n\nThe salmon citrus roll: also amazing. As was the spinach salad, which was served as compressed, rolled-up, steamed spinach leaves that were about the size of dolmas.\n\nAnd to top it all off, they had an amazing and extensive sake menu -- hot, cold, filtered and unfiltered, etc. They're very knowledgeable about their selection, and help you choose a sake. I couldn't have been happier with the one I got (don't ask me what it was called).\n\nThis food is pure artistry and you've got to experience it for yourself. Highly recommended!", "Ahhh, this one is easy.  Order the sashimi omakase platter - maybe even 2.  And just eat the most delightful, unique, fresh raw fish you could ever have.

Feel free to order refills though they are charged at $1, which is very decent for the quality of the dip.\n\nWe had Tuna Laap for appetizer ($17).

We had stopped for drinks and apps while we waited for Khe-yo to call us when our turn came up so didn't end up being that hungry. We got the coconut rice app, which was a southeast asian version of arancini. For mains, we got the pork curry noodles and the whole grilled black bass. Both were delicious. You basically make your own lettuce fish tacos. It reminded me a bit of peking duck rolls with the plum sauce and some veggie garnishes. My only suggestion would be including some summer rice paper to make more substantial roll-ups. For dessert, we got a candied ginger bread cake. It was solid. We shared everything Asian family style.

From the Fluke Salad to the Black Bass and Chicken Entrees, everything was purr-fect. And hear this, we don't eat red meat, so our menu choices were limited.

Back to the main point, the mom cooks most of the food (my several observations) so I feel like I really got to eat authentic Thai homemade food. My husband and I ordered a basil fried rice, a tom yum goong soup and a fried chicken wings.

I would suggest making a reservation as this place only seats a handful of guests. Once that hurdle is passed, prepare yourself for some of the best sushi in Chicago. We were greeted by a very friendly wait staff who knew the menu (small) very well. Our waitress had a few suggestions that we tried as well as other things that looked appealing to us.

Neither she nor I consume land animals, so the waiter enthusiastically offered to replace the one beef dish in the ten-dish omakase with scallops.  The food was cartoonishly perfect, so fresh it practically melted away in my mouth.  I had a vision of myself as a grazing shark-- this must be what it's like, I thought, not to have to use a jaw.  People, you need not the heavy artillery of psychedelic mushrooms or huffing paint to get this high, when the potent drugs of fresh fish and hot sake await you down the low-lit halls of Kai Zan.

All evolution beyond this point must be downhill.", "I refrained from reviewing Kai Zan for two years because I already have to wait long enough for reservations. Sadly Check Please and Zagat have done much more to add to that wait than my lowly review ever could. First let me say that this has to be the most friendly, unpretentious and approchable sushi/Japaneese restaurant in the city. Every time I eat here the staff is so friendly and helpful. You can genuinely tell that they all love to work there and want to share their restaurant with you.\nIf you have never eaten here or are unfamiliar with what to order, I reccomend splurging and going for the omokase tasting menu. Try sitting at the bar so you can watch chef brothers Melvin and Carlo prepare the plates. It is truly an experience to watch and converse with these two artesians as they craft some of the best seafood plates available in the city. If you wish to order from the menu instead, I would say it's hard to go wrong with any of the fresh seafood choices, although I would implore you not to miss the escolar pearls. Enjoy Kai Zan, but try not to tell too many people, or you will be waiting outside on Chicago Avenue with me.", "This was my 3rd dinner restaurant stop during a recent visit to Chicago.  It's a relatively small restaurant so you must make a reservation and stick to your reserved time because most likely they can't fit you in earlier or too much later - be prompt!  \n\nIt is not a totally traditional Japanese restaurant but I do recommend the omakase to eat the best of the best here!  I loved the mushroom soup, the oyster and uni shooters, the char sui bite and the sashimi (so fresh, love!!) the best.  They spice up some of their dishes - let's just say the wasabe will clear your sinuses!  \n\nService was attentive and patiently explained the menu and dishes.  And I love the decor of this place - you feel like you stepped into a home in a Japanese village.  Have them call you a taxi if needed after your meal as taxis aren't too frequent in this area.", "Hands down my favorite restaurant in the world.  The atmosphere is laid-back but cute.  The twin brothers who own it are friendly, hospitable (one time they sent me a free dish because they saw me eyeing it from the sushi counter), and beyond good at what they do.  They provide quality cuts of sushi presented in unique and tasty combinations for such a reasonable price in the city.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't order the chef's omakese...only $60 for 9 filling courses of the best sushi you've ever eaten!   The polenta bites are my favorite dish, so I'd also recommend adding this to your omakese as they aren't included.  In addition, they are very accommodating to gluten free and pescatarian diets.  Over the holidays they host a drawing to give away 2 $150 gift cards.  My out of town friends always request Kai Zan when they visit.  Make sure you make a reservation well in advance.", "George and I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of Melvin and Carlo's Ukraine Village 600 sq feet of their own creation Kai Zan (Its fun figuring out who is the Kai and who is the Zan!)\nThe space is cozy and full of energy!

We got to the Inn at 5:30 and had drinks on the patio to watch the bagpiper play and march through the links. Part of the evening not to miss. Next, into the restaurant for dinner a little after 6:30. They put us at a window seat with a 180 view of the ocean and golf course. Wonderful. The dinner choices are great. I had the Chef's soup of the day and veal piccata. My wife had a beet salad and a carbonara pasta dish. Our plates were empty when we were done. Both of us had deserts. My wife's menu had her name on it with a Happy Birthday wish for her. She got a small candle on her desert dish which had Happy Birthday written on the plate in chocolate. Special! Everyone called her by name during the evening. Very nice. It was low key as she likes but made her very happy. The wait staff was there when you wanted them but not over the top. Great service, excellent food and views to die for. It will be one of our goto places in the future for special events. Loved it.", "Incredible sauces! Each time I went I would get the same dish. When the menu changed they still serve me the sauce as a starter with bread, and I even bought a container to take home.\nYears later, the sauce may be long gone, but the excellence of food and service remain. I'm vegan, and asking for a chef's choice is like Christmas morning. You will absolutely get something great, every time. It is an open, bright room, but always comfortable even when crowded. The kitchen help the wait staff when it's crazy, and the chef might stop by to see how things are.\nThis is a highly biased review as the Inn at Spanish Bay and the Lodge at Pebble Beach are my favorite places to treat myself, and where I go because the people ( I only mean staff, the guests can be  ... terrible , but the amazing staff ) are like seeing an old, or new!, friend.

The food and wine rich in Italian tradition and the casual ambiance of a Tuscan villa combined make for a most memorable dining experience. The incredibility flavorful, rustic Italian dishes pair perfectly a wonderful bottle of Antinori and any other of their world-class wines in their cellar.\n\nIn addition to the excellent food, wine and top notch service, you will surely be in awe at the amazing views over the golf links of Spanish Bay and the Pacific Ocean.  This is truly one of the best dining destinations California has to offer!", "Of all the restaurants on the resort, this is the best one. The service was top notch, the atmosphere was perfect, and the food ... Impeccable! This was for my wife's 30th birthday, so I had to go somewhere nice. It was worth every penny. Affettato Misto and Fritto Misto for appetizer - FANTASTIC! With a glass of wine, that could have been a perfect meal. It just got even more perfect with the rib-eye. I've had my fair share of steaks around the bay (mission ranch, whaling station, the forge, chart house) but this one just melted in my mouth, cooked to medium to perfection. We topped it off with the \"fresh made everything\" Tiramisu - AWESOME!!! That was quite possibly the best and worst restaurant I've ever been to. The worst because it ain't cheap, and my wife is expecting to go there for every occasion including the first day of Fall.", "We've owned a home in Pebble for over a year now and hadn't tried P\u00e8ppoli yet, so we decided to make reservations for last night because we had an event at the fire pits that ended at 7. Our reservation was at 8, so we went to Stave for wine flights ahead of time. We got to the hostess stand at 8:05 and our table wasn't ready yet so she asked if we would wait at the bar at Traps next door, we just sat inside and waited because we didn't really want another drink before dinner. The menu is inventive and delicious. I started with the Cesar salad and my husband the octopus. The octopus salad was a little disappointing. Main dishes were the bolognese and the yellow tail, both good. Service was a little \"off\" by pebble beach standards (serving the salads while I was at the ladies room and slow on the water refills)\nI would go back and give it another try because the food is definitely a stand out", "Attended a special dinner here this past weekend and it was fabulous!  It was a big party so we had our own room for the night.  William was our server and he did a great job, especially with the wines.  Frank was an outstanding host (as usual) and the food was oh so good!

As if we weren't already impressed, she gave us periodic updates as the people paid and were getting ready to leave.\n\nWe settled into our much sought after table and spent the next 30-45 min just catching up.  Our server was so patient with us.  We didn't feel rushed to make decisions but our glasses were never empty.  We ordered some light bites: chickpea fritters, rabbit salad with arugula and curried lobster with quinoa.  Everything was great, especially the lobster.  For dessert, we shared a heavenly chocolate pudding/mousse with caramel and cinnamon ice cream.  Total bill with two glasses of pinot noir and two beers: $98.  Not bad.", "Sometimes in life, you just want some wine and cheese. In desperation, I yelped and found this place which was perfectly located between my hotel and art institute and millennium park. This place was so good we ended up going two consecutive days.\n\nThe place is incredibly elegant in decor, I would define it as fine dining. White table clothes, meticulously designed and well placed lighting. It's a take on high end English pub dining.\n\nThe service is exceptional. There's an art and science to the restaurant business and you can tell management subscribes to service standards. We were seated, given water, and placed our drink menus in a rapid tandem like sequence.\n\nThe wine was of a dapper selection, though there wasn't any imitation from the server on what paired well. As stated, we got wine and cheese and their cheese plate has 3 high quality cheese although the price point of 16 dollars is a little overpriced.\n\nOther than that, it was amazing!", "Grabbed a quick bite here one night after hearing great things about The Gage. Was a bit hard to find at night considering its location and dark interior, but for a bar/gastropub, that's almost certainly a given.\n\nI can't say that I'm giving The Gage a fair review because I ordered my House Poutine to go, but what I had to eat was decent. Pork shoulder stayed tender and had the nice meaty flavor I was expecting, and the cheese curds were as good as any. I questioned the use of the carrots given the crispiness of the fries, but it wasn't a big deal. Speaking of the fries, they weren't anything special, but I guess they don't have to be when they're going to be covered in gravy, meat, and some veggies anyways. Gravy had a nice strong-but-not-overpowering flavor as well. The portion was pretty substantial so I'd say that you're getting your money's worth of food - I'm just not sure that it's the best you can do for that price. But again, this was take-out, so take my word with a grain of salt.\n\nCan't speak too much about service since I didn't actually have a waiter. Will try to come back some day for an actual sit-down meal to give a more accurate review.", "If you're seeing a show at the The Chicago Theater, this is a great spot to grab dinner beforehand. Front bar area is loud and crowded so be sure to make a reservation for the less chaotic back dining area. Service is fast and food is solid.\n\nWe had the Fish and Chips and the Thai Coconut Curry. Not exactly a cohesive menu but both dishes were really good. Fish and chips were crispy on the outside with tender fish on the inside. Came with ketchup, tasty tartar sauce, and a small coleslaw side.\n\nAtmosphere is refined but not uptight. Seating in the dining room area is comfortable and cozy. Great restaurant for the area.", "Love The Gage. Some of the best eclectic Irish fare you will find outside of Ireland. Whether you sit at the bar or in a booth your experience will be memorable. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is how crowded the bar is and the length of the wait when you don't have a reservation. Not a place you can just drop in for a drink or a quick meal. Otherwise it is awesome."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gage-chicago?hrid=8UqdQ6pPP08D73xhPtTVpA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gage-chicago?hrid=oUva8hb-vpOra4Um37nbSw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gage-chicago?hrid=2l5T-N0eFgBD7WIsjiYC2g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gage-chicago?hrid=IK0qK2UHTMrI63grjxm_LA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gage-chicago?hrid=QDjH3kCFibZVdZPM8TakaQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-gage-chicago?hrid=SK7fLIthXtrqQ52vxHiDBA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Mille Fleurs", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/mille-fleurs-restaurant-rancho-santa-fe/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/rancho-santa-fe/restaurant/mille-fleurs", "michelin_pov": "Set in the quaint village of Rancho Santa Fe, Mille Fleurs has been a longtime\u2014over 30 years\u2014haunt among locals celebrating special occasions.

Thanks to my best friends' recommendation to my husband (very sneaky!).  Yes, my husband did surprise me --- not only with a dozen red roses but fine dining at the most coveted Rancho Santa Fe dining establishment.\n\nI enjoyed the drive through Rancho Santa Fe. This is a formal French dining experience.  The menu items are not easy to maneuver but the waiter was helpful in translating!  We enjoyed our wine and our hors' d'euvres. Then soup and our main course.  Of course, it wouldn't have been a celebration without dessert.  It was a leisurely night of dining and relaxation.  I especially liked the fireplace and live piano.\n\nWe enjoyed our night and I felt very special and loved.  I recommend Mille Fleurs for any special occasion!\n\nAlso, now there are some special promotions that I'd like to try at Mille Fleur.  Bistro Night is every Wednesday and is touted as a less formal, casual night featuring live piana jazz and discounted prices on selected items.  There is also a new Monday Prix Fixe Menu for only $40 per person!\n\nBon Appetit!", "We're staying in Rancho Santa Fe for a few nights and had dinner here on their patio, which was a lovely setting.  Myles had the fennel soup which was delicious.  He had a mozzarella caprese salad, which was over-priced for the amount of cheese on the salad - maybe 2-3 ounces!  Really chancy, i think.  It could have been so much better with a nice creamy burrata.\n\nI had the wiener schnitzel, which was really just okay.  Nothing to write home about.  The breading should puff away from the meat, which it didn't do, but the meat was tender and the serving size was adequate.  Lemon butter caper sauce was tasty.  I ordered spaetzle to go with, and it was just plain old bad.  I think the chef must have grated some cheese onto the noodle and called it good.  It was terrible so I sent it back.    \n\nThe service was quite nice, and the setting was lovely.  Overall, i'd say I was pretty disappointed with the quality of the food, especially in this high rent district of Southern California.", "See why it's been around for over 20 years!  \nEnjoyed a dinner for four which happened to be during SD Restaurant Week. I liked the fact you could stick to the price fixe menu or take your choice of upgrading almost all your selections if you wanted to put something together on your own. I opted to upgrade for a nominal amount for the Lobster Bisque and was not disappointed. This restaurant had a laid back vibe and felt cozy and local. Bit surprised that some people have had such negative experiences, but it was a win for us. A little sad we couldn't get escargot, but the schnitzel made me forget about it. Love the fact its just kind of in the middle of Rancho Santa Fe and an adventure to get to.", "Mille Fleurs is one of the top dining destinations in greater San Diego, that's my personal opinion, but I know for a fact that it is shared by many. If you are looking for phenomenal, classic French fare, with infallible service, you are destined for Mille Fleurs.\n\nIf you are of a fan of any of the main ingredients of the dishes below, they are must-haves:\n\n-Lobster & Papaya Salad\n-Foie Gras\n-The Duck - I think it was a dual preparation\n\nWine list is very extensive - which is great for enthusiasts, but if you haven't pre-studied this bible beforehand, is a tad daunting. MF has you covered though, the sommelier is very knowledgeable and happy to take into consideration your preferences, what your main entree will be and even price point when making a recommendation.\n\nMille Fleurs is deserving of your whole evening - if you are taking someone special here, take a car service (especially if you don't live in North County), enjoy everything from start to finish, take advantage of the varietals on the wine list and maybe even drop by the piano/music/jazz action in the courtyard area afterwards.\n\nYou will go, and you will be better for it.", "We celebrated my husband's birthday here over the weekend while staying at the nearby Inn.  After staring at the menu and the wine menu for a little while, struggling to decide what to eat and to pick a bottle of wine, we finally settled on the 7-course tasting menu, with wine pairings.  The service was was impeccable and the food and wine amazing.  We suspect this menu was designed to make one forget one is in a very fine dining establishment and just break down and lick the plate!  We managed to resist this temptation by a very fine margin and depart with our dignity still intact.  When I find an excuse to return to the Inn, we will definitely have to return to Mille Fleurs as well.", "When we went to another restaurant in rancho santa fe everyone suggested that we go here for the piano bar at night and watch the \"show\". Unfortunately we didn't get to stay the whole night because we had a wedding event to attend but for the time that we were there we had a great experience. Our waitress was friendly and welcoming as we told her we are from out of town and she explained the whole experience to us. As the night progressed the bar got more and more crowded with young women, old men and old couples. We were told from others who have been there before that there will be young women there to catch the old rich mens attention and there sure were! There was a great environment as some people danced to the songs and some sang. I can see how this would get wild as the night progressed!

If you prefer to eat outside on the vast patio, you will put your name in when you arrive. This place is amazing, be prepared to wait, BUT never fear, there is a huge bar inside and another at the back of the patio. We opted to hang out on the back patio bar. At that bar we got amazing hand crafted drinks, we tried the house margarita, the premium house margarita and the watermelon fresca, all delicious! While waiting for our table we enjoyed the view of downtown San Diego. There is comfy furniture you can sit on, and waitresses to bring you drinks and appetizers from a special bar menu. We aren't the most adventurous eaters (don't eat seafood) but the items we tried were on point with Modern Mexican, and delicious. While we loved the outdoor seating I do look forward to returning with a reservation to try a meal in the dining room with table side guacamole.", "For anyone planning to take me out to dinner, please consider Coasterra. I cannot imagine a better setting to enjoy Mexican food and an unbelievable view. Interestingly, most of the parking is only available via $7 valet.\n\nChef Deborah and staff certainly have the food under control. The chipotle chicken gorditas were scrumptious! Filled with chorizo, avocado, and serrano sauce - I wish that I had eaten more. Other highlights were the ahi tuna tostada and the poblano corn chili. All very flavorful.\n\nThe ambience sets Coasterra apart from other restaurants. Along with the fire pits, high ceilings, and modern decor, the magnificent panoramic view of the water and downtown area make for a beautiful setting. This is definitely a place to go when looking for both dinner and a nice sunset photshoot. The patio is large (which helps when trying to avoid passerbys in your selfie) and service is fantastic. Shoutout to Jesse who served me the best glass of water I could have ever asked for.", "It is said that we eat with our eyes, boy were we full! Amazing view with a great atmosphere of the restaurant, plus you can't go wrong when Deborah Scott is involved. We stared at the bar. My husband had one of the best mojitos I have ever tasted. I had the watermelon agua fresca which was too strong for me. All I could taste was tequila but it did the trick.  For appetizer, We had the calamari. They were out-of-this-world. Spicy but not too spicy. The sauce was a yummy red chili sauce that was a little sweet, which complemented the salty and crispy fried calamari. Best part of our meal. I had the seafood salad. Seafood was cooked to perfection. The rest of the salad was good but the seafood made it. My husband had the seafood enchiladas. The creamy sauce was so good! For dessert we had the refreshing and satisfying gelato trio with a cup of coffee as we enjoyed the sun setting on the buildings downtown.  Amazing and D-lish!! Great place to bring out-of-town guest to.", "It pains me to write a lukewarm review of what I was hoping to be an amazing restaurant.

I absolutely cannot knock the fantastic location and view, but that alone can't make up for the just okay food and drinks, especially for the price.\n\nWe got a few different cocktails, the margarita being my favorite, and the chips and salsa arrived soon after we got seated... nothing to write home about. The burger was really good, and the churros were decent. All in all it was a good meal and okay service, but I just don't see myself paying full price for what we experienced (we were given a crg gift card and thought we'd finally try this location.) Maybe I'll come back for happy hour to get an evening out started, but I think there are a bunch of other great spots for dinner that we'd head too afterwards. Perhaps I'll come back and get some more Mexican food to give it a second chance...", "We went here for a very special anniversary dinner. Though it was chilly weather, we wanted a seat on the patio rail - excellent choice. They do have heaters, but weren't necessary. The view across the bay to the downtown skyline was incredible; certainly didn't hurt that the city was decorated for Christmas! Everyone from the hosts to the servers were extremely polite and professional. The prices may seem a bit steep, but you get a lot for your money! As a vegan/vegetarian couple I'd already scouted the menu, and happily found enough choices to make it interesting. We started with glasses of wine and the tableside guacamole. It was delicious (and so much we had lunch from it the next day). My partner had the poblano white corn soup, which he said was delicious, and I had the beet tartare tostada.

Service was attentive but dinner took a while to show up. To be fair, we were 10 people. My partner ordered the half chicken which tender and tasty. Someone ordered the lobster and short ribs.

WOW, how refreshing.  One of the waiters or managers also spoke to me and made me feel welcome.  He had worked at Burma Superstar in SF for many years.  This place has it down.  The food is so tasty it's like crack to me.  Tea Leaf salad is spot on, fresh, tasty with great dressing, I also had the spicy green beans (so simple and yet I've seen this dish killed many times - this is super bright, not greasy, perfect spice and savory - you don't feel like it's decadent, you just feel like you're having some amazingly prepared vegetables) coconut rice and I forget what else, one other amazing dish of curry.

But if you're in the area, it's definitely a must. The staff is also really friendly and I feel like the quality of their food is one of the best Burmese restaurants in the Bay Area. We always get the tea leaf salad, shrimp baos, angel wings, garlic noodles and green beans. Tea leaf salad is a must whenever you order from a Burmese restaurant, warning there are peanuts if you have a nut allergy, the combination of textures and flavors are so good and on the healthier side. I've tried their beef & shrimp baos and I prefer their shrimp baos, large pieces of shrimp, very flavorful and really good with the sauce to make it spicy and add some extra flavor. Garlic noodles, wings, ribs, and green beans are honorable mentions that are popular as well. Burmese food can be on the pricey side but would still highly recommend!", "Comparable to Burma Superstar (and B-Star Cafe) in the city, but one might even say a little pricier in this crowded Marin joint.\n\nTea leaf salad is ALWAYS a must, and while the specials (more asian fusion style dishes) might be worth considering, I'd stick with the classics and traditional Burmese dishes. I remember finding the Korean-influenced dishes (short rib, kimchi, you get the idea) to be one of the less tasteful dishes.\n\nUpdate to this^: last night I had the traditional Burmese fish chowder which was DELICIOUS. 100% recommend that. We also shared the coconut chicken curry (I'd rate it a 3/5) and the spicy shrimp chow fun (4/5).\n\nFamily-style is undoubtedly the best way to dine here -- each dish is so varied that you will WANT to try a bit of them all. Take the risk and ask the servers for their recommendations, they will not let you down. Burmatown shows a commitment to their patrons, and that (plus delicious food, I mean......) is what will keep me coming back again and again. Alas, prepare to be leave feeling satisfied and stuffed!", "ALWAYS WORTH THE WAIT. The food is exquisite and the service is personal. Our party of six waited well over an hour to be seated. The system is well-oiled, though. We wrote our name on the list and walked over to Zinz, the local wine bar down the street, to enjoy a glass of wine while we waited for our table. When the call finally came, we strolled over to Burmatown, eager to taste the freshness awaiting us. We started with the tea leaf salad, a tasty mix that quickly lets you know that this is no ordinary place. The bao tacos soon followed...the buns were so delicate and fresh. And the crispy angel wings...wow. The hits kept rolling. Sharing is the way to go to enjoy the full range of delicious options. The staff work as a team -- from Jenny in the kitchen to Mike and the gang up front. They take exceptional care of the details and their guests.\n\nPart of Burmatown's charm is its size, so pace is important - for the sake of the small business and for those who are waiting for a table.

The crispy shrimp tacos were equally delicious with just the right amount of spiced, cooled down nicely with the crunchy cabbage slaw. You must always get the guacamole and chips and the tostadas are a must too. Yesterday's version was halibut ceviche and last month it was crab tostada which was so fresh and tasty it may very well be the best thing I've eaten here. With their enchiladas suizas that says a lot! This spot is the best Mexican food in Northern California, hands down! The staff are so pleasant and helpful the customer service plus the outstanding food makes the entire experience very memorable.", "The Niman Ranch pork tamales were truly to die for.  The masa is so soft and flavorful, as opposed to the chewy, crumbly stuff that everyone's used to.  And the pork is so tender and juicy with a crunch vegetable relish.\n\nBohemia beer-battered fish tacos were also good.  Crispy fried outside with a tender, juicy sea Bass on the inside.\n\nThe mole on the chicken enchiladas had a really good, deep flavor, but might be overpowering for some tastes.\n\nNachos Verde and salsa verde were about average.  We were bummed they ran out of Chile rillenos.", "We drove through the hills and valleys of Napa to dine here on a weekday evening. My friend recommended this place, and I honestly didn't expect much. However, I was BLOWN AWAY! These were honestly some of the best tacos I've ever had! I love how they serve the tacos on ONE tortilla and it remains intact (I can't stand restaurants that give you two tortillas per taco... too much tortilla!). We each ordered separate dishes and shared one.\n\nCrispy shrimp tacos - GET IT.  Serrano and pumpkin seed salsa?! The salsa was amazing. It has a little bit of heat but was not overwhelming at all. The shrimp remained crispy and the tortilla to filling balance was perfect.\n\nBeef birria tacos - GET IT. This order came with 3 tacos. The meat was so juicy and soft - literally just melts in your mouth. They really pack in the meat as well. I still think about this till this day...\n\nHalibut tostada - My friend got this. Didn't try it but she said it was very good as well.", "Delicious, fresh, interesting food. Not the place to go if you are looking for a cheap taco or fat, sloppy burrito-that's not what this place is about. The menu is pretty small but thoughtful and everything I've tried has been delicious and wonderfully prepared. Chicken tamales are hands-down the best I've ever had. And, no it is not cheap but man, folks have got to get over the fact that good food made with quality ingredients costs more than the stuff the roach coach down the street is slinging. Modest surroundings and somewhat slowish service are the only things that keep me from giving it 5 stars and certainly don't keep me from wanting to eat here as much as I can.", "This wine country Mexican Joint marries authentic flavors with elevated delivery.  It was worth the slightly premium price\n\nThis is a order at the counter type place with a quick moving line.   It's very clean.\n\nThe menu has just the right amount of variety.\nWe started with a small guacamole and chips which came quickly and was huge.  All fresh ingredients with house made chips.\n\nOur mains were fish tacos and ceviche either of which was large enough to share.  The fish and salsas were homemade and served on hot house made tortillas.\n\nGive it a try", "So good! I'm a picky eater so I was a little scared when I walked in and saw the menu. Of course, I got the most basic thing I could.. a chicken quesadilla. But wow! So much flavor. I was also pleasantly surprised by the green salsa. It was great with the chips and on top of my quesadilla. My husband got the red mole chicken enchiladas and loved them! We will definitely be back!", "Can't get enough of the enchilada suiza.  I always want to try the swiss chard enchilada (I've heard it is amazing), but I can't seem to venture away from my favorite.  One day...but until then, I'm gonna keep going back for my favorite!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-molino-central-sonoma?hrid=TUDvXaPyOsUK4fP1l0-Yyw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-molino-central-sonoma?hrid=ldkmrpemZVF8_JDOd9NN8A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-molino-central-sonoma?hrid=EC6Z20thFUD9KEmuhU7--g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-molino-central-sonoma?hrid=ztVHeenQEHi79wqUxVAAlw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-molino-central-sonoma?hrid=RF8T3AFMxyIRMciGmT35Nw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-molino-central-sonoma?hrid=XObM3m6xQ_JsX3JTWdqawg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-molino-central-sonoma?hrid=R2-yQ7K8qL_dZ5B7tVzE-w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/el-molino-central-sonoma?hrid=nnRQwGSkYpKxZ5FT3K5www&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Roister", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/roister-chicago-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/roister", "michelin_pov": "In contrast to the boundary-pushing Alinea and the elaborate whims of Next, Chef Grant Achatz's Roister is downright rustic and approachable. Boldly incorporated into its dark dining room, the kitchen serves as the focal point of this unapologetically loud and laid-back space\u2014where the best seats are at the counter, facing the blazing hearth.\nThe cooking is hearty and refined, incorporating that wood fire at every turn possible. Start with the likes of hearth-roasted rainbow carrots enriched by smoked labneh and pistachio croutons, before digging into a bowl of rigatoni with Wagyu Bolognese. Smoke even finds its way into dessert, like a boulder of ember ice cream served on a bed of crushed hazelnuts, cherry jam, and milk chocolate mousse.", "yelp_reviews": ["I would best describe Chef Grant Achatz's baby restaurant as \"different\". Different, but excellent. Upon dining at Roister, one will notice the inventiveness and imagination that goes into each dish. For instance, the aged cheddar rilletes is a combination of truffle, cauliflower, and cheese, and is served with fried bread lightly dusted with salt and sugar. One would not think that the combination of those ingredients would marry well, but the richness of the dish, combined with the sweet/salty dichotomy of the bread makes for a party in my mouth.\n\nEvery time I come to Roister I make it a mission to order something I haven't had before off their menu, and each time I'm happy I did. I would recommend the hearth roasted carrots with smoked labne, sicilian pistacios, and valencia orange. I believe the chef also added some coffee to this dish, making it the best carrot dish I've ever had in my life.\n\nUnrelated to food, but the music here is really spot on (a little too loud, but a great selection of R&B and throwback hits). Roister is hip, casual, and a really good time.", "First Michelin Star experience and it did not disappoint! My boyfriend and I managed to get a reservation for seating at the hearth for dinner. It was exciting to see the chefs at work preparing each dish and to have the roaring fire in the back smoking and cooking the octopus and chicken. We made a reservation and had to put a deposit for the reservation. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful with menu options and suggestions. We took her advice and ordered the aged cheddar rillettes-delicious! We also ordered the octopus, baked lasagna and half chicken. The octopus had a very strong smoky flavour and the accompanying sauce was delicious. The baked lasagna was decent- not very memorable, however the chicken was the most surprising. It was prepared in two different ways : fried and pan seared/roasted. AMAZING! We have never tasted chicken so delicious. The fried chicken was crunchy yet flavorful and tender yet not too oily, and the baked had a crispy skin but was still extremely juicy on the inside. For dessert we had the ember ice cream, created by the embers of the same fire hearth in the kitchen. How creative! It was very tasty and a great ending to the meal. We will definitely be returning next time we are in Chicago!", "Absolutely loved it! Familiar foods, all elevated. We picked out an item in every section, selecting the hushpuppies, wedge salad, lasagna, duck, and for desserts the foi gras chocolate bar and the cookies/milk ice cream. The entrees were amazing. The best hushpuppies ever and the duck with orange chips sitting on a bed of fried rice was superb! Loved the veggie lasagna, the cheese melts perfectly. The wedge was delicious with the horse radish dressing.\n\nThe desserts did not wow like the entrees but I did like the cookies and milk ice cream. The foi gras tasted like straight up butter and was way too lardy to handle. Overall, an awesome experience and will return.\n\nGreat 1 star Michelin restaurant!", "We must have come in on an extremely off night because literally every dish tasted as if a Morton's truck had dumped its entire salty payload on our plates.\n\nAs the dishes were served, we kept telling ourselves that surely this would eventually work itself out, but unfortunately, it seemed like the chef was just getting started on doubling up our sodium intake for the week.\n\nAged Cheddar Rilletes - a good start with strong flavors and appropriately salted\nSourdough Pancake - decent but nothing special\nYukon Fries - fancy potato wedges but a nice filler nonetheless\nScallop Crudo - the passion fruit completely overpowers the dish, thought it would just be a hint of it but the delicateness of the crudo was nowhere to be found\nVeggie of the Day - this turned out to be hipster kimchi that was too pickled with not enough spice to counter balance it\nLasagna - tasty but it's a fairly small block of pasta for $25\n\nCocktails were solid but not on par with the craft cocktail standard bearers. Overall, we were expecting much more given the background of the chefs. Perhaps after I stop taking the hypernatremia medication which I will surely be prescribed by my PCP after my next physical, I would consider a return visit.\n\nuntil then, i will, in the poignant words of senor dos XX , stay thirsty...", "We have had good experiences at Alinea & Aviary so were looking forward to taking our kids to this affiliated restaurant.  Apparently it lost its Michelin star & from our experience it wasn't hard to see why.  My duck was so undercooked that I couldn't even cut it & had to be sent back. My wife sent her drink back.  Desserts weren't good.  Also, I got the seat on this narrow aisle that led to the other dining room & had people brushing by me all night.  It felt like the subway.  Our conversation kept getting interrupted by staff telling me to move my chair.  After being told to move around 4 times I got irritated & then was scolded by a bus person, lovely.   I wonder what a heavier person would do in this seat -- probably be miserable.  As a capper, we were still forced to tip 20%.   On the plus side the chicken and fois gras were good.\n\nThere are probably 5 restaurants I would prefer within a couple blocks of this one, including Swift & Sons across the street.", "By far the best meal I have had in my life!  Everything was made perfectly, and had amazing and unique flavors even for dishes that don't sound like they could be that different from other places (the fried chicken, for instance, was amazing).  Staff was super professional but still laid back.  Service was on point.  The atmosphere was fantastic.  It is really cool watching all of the cooks work.  You can tell they are dedicated to their craft.\n\nThe best dining experience of my life.

Global flavors make a guest appearance too, like jam\u00f3n Serrano from Salamanca, Spain. Portraits of pigs hang in the room, and sure enough, braised pork belly flash-fried and laid over a sunchoke pur\u00e9e with blanched fava beans makes for a spectacular finish.Bargain-hunters should come for the Pub-fixe or for the $14 specialty lunch board, proffering charcuterie, bread, and cheese.", "yelp_reviews": ["Step inside this restaurant and you will find yourself in a place that feels like a European beer hall.\n\nThe Publican focuses on pork, oysters, and beer. The beer list is very extensive that at first glance it could look intimidating especially with the excellent myriad of beers made up of local and international microbrews that a lot of people have probably not heard of. But, ask your server anything about beer and he/she will have answers for you. Tell your server what type of beer you like e.g. wheat beer vs. hoppy beer, and they will have recommendations. Or, say that you like Blue Moon, and asked what beers are similar to that. They will have answers for you.\n\nThe caramelized pork belly is always a pleaser and arguably one of the best we have had. A bite of the pork belly melts in the mouth each time. The aged ham is always a must-have for us. We generally like to do a taste of three hams since each variety has its own characteristics. The little gem salad is also very good and it comes with crispy pig ears! Mmm! Don't be afraid of it. It hardly tastes anything like what it sounds. And of course, get the oysters. And the big pot of mussels.", "I couldn't find a thing to complain about! All-in-all, The Publican made for a perfect birthday brunch with my partner.\n\nI always order beer but I couldn't resist ordering from the specialty drink menu. So many creative offerings. I opted for the \"brunch box\" which was bitter but not too strong. For an appetizer we split the frittes with an egg. Apparently frittes are supposed to be crispy. These were not. I preferred them more on the soggy side. Perfect for dipping in egg yolk.\n\nFor the meal I ordered the duck confit and my bf ordered the sourdough pancake. The duck was ultra flavorful and a bit spicey. The pancake was the perfect blend of salty and sweet.\n\nThe waitstaff is expertly attentive and knew the menu well. We asked for some suggestions and our server lead us to the right dishes. Or maybe everything here is just delicious.\n\nIt's a bit pricey. Yes. But the food and atmosphere are worth every penny. I couldn't have asked for a better way to start off a new year than with a full belly.", "I guess I don't get all the hoopla about this place. We made a reservation six weeks in advance for a booth, yet when we showed up we were not allowed to sit in one despite the fact that they were all empty and the place was dead. They claim they have to save them for larger parties. Right, there were still empty ones by the time we left.\n\nBeyond the poor seating service, the food was better than average as was the beer list but certainly not worthy of the prices they are charging. My porchetta was tasty enough but parts of it were dry and other parts greasy. My wife's fried clams were tasty as well and were dressed in something similar to a ceasar salad. The side of pickles were extremely vinegary and were rather challenging to consume.\n\nThe beer list was not extensive but was thought out. The house lambic was certainly of average caliber and overpriced at $10 for a 10oz pour.\n\nAfter dropping almost $100.00 we left feeling unwelcome, unimpressed, and disappointed.", "It's all about the swine!\n\nPaintings of big fat pigs, pigs on the napkins, pigs of all sorts on the menu.\n\nOn a recent visit to my childhood hometown of Chicago, I was lucky enough to score reservations at Publican.

For that reason I'm taking a star away. There are private \"pens\" for tables of 4 which surround the dining room, and may be more conducive to conversations.\n\nThat being said, service was excellent and everything on the menu was fantastic!  Go with a group and order up to share!  Spicy pork rinds, pomme frites with egg, pork belly, duck hearts (\"Are those ventricles?!

Great service that delivers.  Mmmmmmmm......", "This is a fun re-creation of a public house concept. There is community seating centrally, with stand-up tables scattered around. The outer seating is booth seating enclosed by swinging doors. The menu is seasonal and interesting. We went for brunch, which filled up quickly after opening. The service is pretty speedy too. We had the porchetta sanwhich, which is this amazing pork topped with pimento cheese spread on a brioche bun, topped with a fried egg. It was sooooo good! The chimichurri quail was a hearty meal, served with a good helping of cornbread, baked beans, and a poached egg. The crab scramble was delicate and the flavor of the crab shine through despite the other ingredients. It was served with buttery crunchy bread. We had a side of hash browns which were golden and crunchy, and I think they were better than the Waffle House counterpart. The Bloody Mary was quite spicy, so do ask to hold the tobacco if you aren't a fan of spice- they make their own mix and it's good by itself. Our coffee cups and water glasses remained filled promptly. This place is worth a visit! They take reservations so be sure to make one!", "Came here with some coworkers.\n\nPros: Food was very tasty.

There are always seasonal specials too!\n\nBeen there twice now and each time was a memorable and distinguishable experience. The decor also allows you to feel like you're leaving NYC and stepping into Japan.\n\nGo go go to Sushi Daizen!", "Another jewel in LIC. Two of us went there for dinner. We didn't know if we could get in but surprisingly they were completely wide open on Friday night around 8.40.\n\nWe decided to sit at the bar. I think they have booths in the back.\nThe bar area is extremely bright so don't expect romantic ambiance. Instead, you can see how impeccable the place is and how amazingly skilled the chefs are.\nWe went for sushi and sashimi omakase. We started with a mind blowing sea urchin appetizer - three different kinds of Uni from Japan, Cali and Maine. It was amazing to be able to taste how different they are.\nOur female Japanese chef was working right in front of us. Her work was precise and beautiful. The cleanliness and freshness of the fish was undeniable.\nMy favorite pieces were tofu, all nigiri, the fish broth soup and the fatty tuna hand roll, of course. The least fave was the egg which was rather sweet.\nThere was no desert but we finished with a great cup of green tea.\nThe service and the timing were impeccable.\nThis place blew Shi and Murasaki out of the water for us. It is definitely pricier ($90 for omakase) but worth it.", "So many things to love about this place. It's right in our neighborhood. The space is wooden minimalist interior yet inviting and comfortable. The chef and staff are welcoming and kind. And the Omakase is EXCELLENT! And the cherry on the top is the insane value of this meal - which allows us to pop on by over and over. This is one of our favorite places in the city.\n\nThe meal starts with a simple fish broth followed by this delightful trio of tamago and two other amuse bouche that varies by season.\n\nThen you move onto several amazing slices of fish. Chef Etsuzo cuts and moves like a musician. He present each delicious fish graciously. There is a reason this is our most frequented omakase in NYC.\n\nWe moved to Brooklyn since I started this review a while back but we will make trips back out to LIC just to eat here.", "Came here last night with two others for their sushi omakase!\n\nThe service is nice, but quiet. Both our server and our sushi chef were on the reserved side. The restaurant was nice, clean and simple. We sat at the bar and each ordered the 10pc sushi omakase.\n\nThey gave us a small plate of tamago, torched mochi, seaweed salad and mackerel that was adorable, but fell short taste wise. The mackerel was really tough.\n\nI thought each of the pieces was fresh! Not particularly inventive (she put the same soy on each piece) or mindblowing, but good quality fish. A bit pricy considering I could get a decent omakase in the city for around the same price.\n\nPersonal favorites include the anago, golden eye snapper, botan ebi and yellowtail (sashimi)!\n\nWe weren't full after 10pcs so we ordered 4 pieces each a la carte. Their a la carte prices are decent. They gave us these little sushi candies at the end of our meals, which was so cute! I'm happy with the meal, but probably wouldn't revisit (for a long time).", "Omakase is the only way to roll, particularly if you are parents that have been busily neglecting your relationship. Truly, what good is anything if it's not founded on trust, whether it's your wife or your local chef? The mother of my child is looking plum in a rare dress. I'd put on a shirt; we're both making an effort.\n\nI would love to say that we waxed poetical about the moon, the tides, and the vast migrations of fish following currents as they swept above the continental shelves--this broad sweep of nature ending its journey in our guts--but really we just talked smack about our so-called friends and spouted the most hideous things about our colleagues. We sated ourselves on the meat of tuna, snapper, sardine, amberjack, scallop, a fat tuna, salmon, tiger shrimp, uni, and eel. I think there was a vegetable involved: ramps? We ate it all, our eyes and skin glowing with satisfaction.", "I've ordered the omakase take-out option twice and will probably order it many more times.  It's perfectly packaged, always ready on time, the staff is kind, and the food is absolutely delicious.  It's made me fall in love with the restaurant despite not having dined inside, but the quality of the fish for takeout has driven me to make two separate reservations when we have company in town.  Can't wait!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-daizen-long-island-city?hrid=IYdAmgC2efC9obb1YE49RA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-daizen-long-island-city?hrid=Ts7uAygjTWQ38xVz2VDDHQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-daizen-long-island-city?hrid=VTCmjQ8cynUXYIgmj_8BQA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-daizen-long-island-city?hrid=8WnW4FCVYMjhspX-jPpgqA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-daizen-long-island-city?hrid=YPsClAP3IB8U7tU6dQiLNQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/sushi-daizen-long-island-city?hrid=V071cbbV7w6VmxZllBmrKg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}]
