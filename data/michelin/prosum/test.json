Its interior is simple, outfitted with wood tables, warm lighting, and a Dia de los Muertos mural. A small bar faces the white-tiled open kitchen, where cooks work the grill and press house-made corn tortillas at a steady clip.\nThe street food of Mexico City inspires Chef Cassandra Rhodes\u2019 concise, well-conceived menu. Authentic tacos and antojitos pepper the carte, alongside homey creations like braised chicken salsa verde enchiladas, smothered in melted queso Oaxaca; or braised octopus tostadas, paired with mandarin salsa. Save room for irresistible churros, served with chocolate- and cinnamon-caramel sauces.", "yelp_reviews": ["i want to lead this review with saying that i had THE best dessert and some of my favorite cocktails i have ever had when i dined at oso, BUT the unanimous vote in my party was that the food left a bit to be desired. by no means is the food bad, but the tacos were a bit on the dry side and could've used a bit more potent seasonings/flavors. however, you are making a mistake if you don't come in for the housemate churros served with molten chocolate and cinnamon caramel sauce in addition to their horchata ice cream. i'm always weary of servers up-selling just for the sake of up-selling, but you really need to get both of these desserts for the full experience. the cold ice cream, the hot churro, and the rich flavors of the chocolate and caramel make for a truly amazing ride for your taste buds. my friends and i tried six of the eight unique cocktails on their menu and we were pleased with ALL of them. you really can't go wrong, but my absolutely favorite was the taco truck followed by the ros\u00e9 sangria. overall, the dessert, drinks, and ambiance make for a great experience! definitely something worth checking out in the neighborhood!", "The menu isn't very appealing but I wanted to check things out. As far as the space itself it's really nice, the bathroom is large and there is a Dia De Los Muertos mural happening on one of the walls. I had the enchilada and the chicken was too mushy, the meat reminded me of turkey for some reason and whatever sauce they used smelled weird. I couldn't eat it. My friend had tacos and yes yes for 4.50 they are too small. Overall, I would say come for drinks.", "Had walked down to Harlem Public to get brunch and found out they don't do brunch on Saturday.  We were in the mood for eggs/breakfast type food rather than burgers so we left and wandered toward the Grange, but decided to try Oso because it is new and I had looked at their dinner menu yesterday.  I'm glad we did! They have outdoor sidewalk seating but we chose to sit inside because it was so hot today.  The atmosphere is cool and relaxed - I like the mural and the trellis with climbing vines in the back.  I had chilequiles con salsa verde with an egg over easy added - large portion, good heat, and very tasty.  It also comes with a small side of salad greens.  Bloody Maria was fine and coffee served in mugs not tiny cups (which I appreciate).  Staff was attentive and kindly refilled our water probably six times.  I realized mid-meal that the tortillas in my chilequiles were handmade as I saw one of the chefs in the open kitchen making a big bowl of dough.  Husband had scrambled eggs with chorizo and potatoes, he thought it was good but not exciting.  That said, he also said he would definitely come back for dinner - sounds good to me!", "This place hits the spot with a cozy ambience, good drinks and comforting food. The beet and arugula salad, grilled corn (cheesy!!!) and steed octopus were all very good. The salad was a lightly dressed and slightly sweet, a perfect way to kick up an appetite. The grilled corn packed a punch of flavors and a generous of cheese  around a nicely charred cob. The braise octopus  had such great, soft texture and blended in so nicely with the mandarin and potatoes. Finally, the guacamole tasted really fresh and well seasoned. Everything was well-balanced and spot on in amount of seasoning. Will definitely be back for more.", "Ummm, yeaaah.   The design of the restaurant is amazing.  The food, however, is hit-or-miss.  As others have said:  Yes, the chips and salsa are a complete waste of time. I can't.  I would be more enthusiastic about Tostitos and any rando grocery store salsa.  The quesadilla was like a slap in the face.  Ouch!  No thank you!  The tamales were tasty (though far less tasty than any tamale lady in the street).  The tacos were not bad, but not memorable.  Our waitress was cute, sweet and full of good service and personality.   The cocktails were well crafted.  In conclusion, I was very hopeful, because I'd read online that Trebek was saving Harlem nightlife, one taco at a time.  Ahem.  Hey, IDEA!  Go to the taco truck across the street.  Then, breeze by Oso for a drink.  Sounds like a plan!", "Whoa. Tacos are MUY MUY BUENO. House made corn tortillas to order. Well balance of flavors and combinations on each taco. We opted for the fish and shrimp tacos, the quesadilla, guacamole, and two margaritas. Delicious. Atmosphere is cool low-key.\n\n***So I was craving more and we returned the next day for more tacos and to try the Octopus dish they have on the menu. And for the sangria of course. We had more fish/shrimp tacos, the \"mole\" taco which was tender chicken (super yum). The octopus dish was very good.. but I wish there would have been more octopus on the plate.\n\nThe rose sangria was so light and refreshing. I could drink it all summer long. Love this place.", "We came to Oso at 8:30 pm on a Wednesday night and they were busyyyyyy. We were able to land seats at the low bar near the kitchen and order some drinks. We waited about 10 minutes for our drinks and decided we wanted to try the elote. As we were sitting across from the line cooks (you could see the full kitchen) we knew our elote shouldn't take that long but alas, we were wrong. Our server was so preoccupied and I don't believe she anticipated how busy it was going to be that night but we ended up being very neglected. Note: This could very well be a one off experience, and we didn't order any of the entrees, but I don't think I'll be back to update this review."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/oso-new-york?hrid=ccRSYFaL0fB3txemopNleg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/oso-new-york?hrid=MoRKGmdIhnv8rCoLGhxUZA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/oso-new-york?hrid=Q-vRAEvVALTSSzNucVgcww&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/oso-new-york?hrid=pJ-yLsmKXBxkMRIVW8OQRA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/oso-new-york?hrid=5ua9Oc0BANFcJLfms9r-ng&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/oso-new-york?hrid=T4FoeZ2TJOLku4elvF_Q3A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/oso-new-york?hrid=yjjY7hzsvQhaqrcK89Qpgg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Hunan Slurp", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/hunan-slurp-new-york-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/hunan-slurp-shop", "michelin_pov": "When you consider the fact that the owner is an artist-turned-chef, it\u2019s no revelation that this long and slender East Village incomer is so beautifully conceived.

That fused with a bit of great taste makes this one of the most sleek and affable spots downtown.\nSuitably baptized, this \u201cslurp shop\u201d is a noteworthy destination for noodles\u2014specifically mifen\u2014which originally hail from Southwest China. Heartier appetites, though, will find much to savor in skewered cumin beef; or smoked pork and tofu slivers saut\u00e9ed with garlic and scallions. Everyone should get the house-made salted chili oil to add a dose of flavor and spice.", "yelp_reviews": ["My friend and I came here specifically for the frog and we weren't disappointed! We shared the following:\n\n1. Stinky tofu - this was a very interesting dish. I've had this back in my hometown which is the province adjacent to Hunan and we make it a bit differently. This was a lot crispier (actually borderline hard) and less... stinky...? Regardless, we enjoyed it.\n2. Hunan charcuterie - a nice platter of beef stomach, beef tripe, pig ear, and smoked bean curd that's thankfully not drenched in chili oil. But we thought it was just okay.\n3. Flaming frog - oh the flavor of this dish! I have very high tolerance for spicy food so personally I didn't find this dish too spicy but appreciated that it had a nice kick to it. Lots of garlic though and it's easy to get confused with the frog bits! Also for those of you who's never eaten frogs before, beware that there are lots of little bones to tease out.\n\nThe sleek and modern decor and the open kitchen definitely elevated our dining experience to the next level.", "Yet another noodle shop in the East Village, and this ones another excellent ride noodle one with a chef that was formerly an artist.\n\nYou can tell even from the outside looking in through the big floor to ceiling window that it's the restaurant of a former artist, as the place is beautiful.\n\nThe rice noodles are of course the thing, and you should get the great Fish Fillet one ($28), which cooks at the table in a piping hot pork and fish broth. The other dishes are excellent too, especially the Smoked Pork with Bean Curd ($12). The Frog Legs ($20) were delicious too, but beware if you're lazy like me that there's a lot of bone to deal with.", "Food: One of the most amazing Chinese food I have had for a long time! The food portions were quite generous which is great because it can be shared with a small group of friends. I cannot recall one dish exceeding the other, each with its own unique flavor, each just as delicious as the next. Definitely try to get one of their noodle dishes and the whole fish (if you dare!). We definitely left with full happy bellies without breaking the bank. Absolutely must go-to place in the east village.\n\nDrink: Its's BOYB! Cannot get better than that! Plus no corkage fee!\n\nVibe: Elegant and traditional. Though a small location, the long tables made good use with the space. Loved the small flower arrangements and the ceiling lights. Great aesthetics! Would recommend this place for a date or small group of friends.\n\nService: Loved the super fast service as everything came out quickly, which was perfect since we all were starving. We made reservations beforehand by calling and we were seated immediately. The waiters were so attentive all the time an", "I've almost never left a review on yelp. Mostly because I've had a good experience and I am lazy. But oh man, isn't this place disappointing.\nI'm a big fan of ramen and rice noodles so when I heard about this place's opening I was excited to try. The prices on the menu were at least 20% higher than other rice noodle shops in town: $32 for a bowl of fish fillet mifen, which took about 40 minutes to serve. And, the waiting wasn't worth it: the fish was overcooked, broth way too spicy, noodles of mediocre quality. Meh.\nAnother dish I feel is way, way overpriced is a cold dish, Hunan Charcuterie. $18 for such a small portion! It's NOTHING like the photo that the owner themselves posted here: yelp.com/biz_photos/huna\u2026\nWe also ordered String Bean Mifen, and it was just okay.\nTo be fair it's only soft opening so there might be a reason to expect a beta (pun intended!) experience later. But I don't think I'm going back soon with so many other alternatives available.", "The d\u00e9cor and service here are top notch. How they plate each dish is very much Michelin-starred level in my opinion. Most importantly, everything we ordered tastes as good as they look!\n\nStrongly recommend Hometown Lufen and skewed  beef, if you are into spicy. I'm a real noodle lover and the Mifen here can make you scream \"YUM\"!! Also the green bean desert soup was delicious and refreshing, very fitting for summertime. Food portion was big, and food was super fast. My husband and I did not have enough mifen, then we ordered string bean mifen for takeout and it was equally delicious. Will definitely come back soon!!!", "Clean, fast, and delicious. A modernized take on Hunan classics without compromising the rich flavors and spices. We ordered the whole fish, house salad (stuffed eggplants), and the irresistable hometown lu fen.", "I am impressed although I am not a noodle person. The food has good quality, looks fresh, had a lot of flavor. The portion is good. the price is a little bit high considering the location and type of the food. The restaurant is really clean, modern, tasteful. The service is amazing, the waiters are polite, professional and well trained. Would like to go back to try more dishes.", "Super good and really easy to get a reservation! The hometown lu fen is really good, as is the spicy octopus and spicy chicken.

But their flavorful fare is considerably spicier, packing heat into everything from fiery red chili lunu miris chutney to deviled chicken. Loaded with ginger and garlic, this stellar tomato-based chicken specialty comes with cooling raita and tangy vegetable curry.", "yelp_reviews": ["Almost came here during the week, but we saw so many awesome reviews about the buffet, that we waited to go on a Sunday.\n\nThe buffet was amazing!! They have different rices, meats, veggies, sides, and desserts to choose from. My favorites were the deviled chicken, the vegetable curry, and the pineapple curry. My husband loved the deviled chicken the best. The only downside about the chicken dish is that there are bones in still, so you have to be more careful when eating.\n\nFor dessert, you've got to try the mango and gooseberry mousse! The gooseberry mousse is green and looks a bit odd, but it's delicious!! The mango mousse tastes a lot like mango lassi. There was a caramel mousse that was also quite good, but the gooseberry and mango seemed to stand out far more.\n\nThe decor in this restaurant is absolutely beautiful. From the walls, table sets, chairs, and the buffet pots, everything is amazingly detailed and immerses you into the Sri Lankan environment. Lakruwana was a wonderful experience and we are looking forward to returning.", "I had only had Sri Lankan food once before and it was at the home of my Sri Lankan friends who took me here today. As you can see from the 5 stars, I was quite impressed.\n\nThe restaurant is like an exhibit on Sri Lankan culture at the AMNH. Even the outside of the building is artfully decorated but it is the inside that is really magnificent. They also have the best designed high back chairs for hanging your coat up that I have ever seen.\n\nLike Ethiopian food, the food is healthy as well as spicy and delicious. I don't know the names of all the things that were on the buffet but they were made with eggplant, dal, chicken, pork, rice, kale and coconut, curried eggs and yucca. For dessert there were several flavors of mousse - chocolate, mango, gooseberry, and caramel as well as another traditional pudding for which I do not know the name or ingredients but it tasted good!\n\nMy hosts explained that the foods are very authentic but toned down in hotness for the benefit of their non-Sri Lankan customers. Not to worry, they have several very spicy condiments if burning your mouth and stomach is your thing!\n\nThe buffet is about $15 and well worth it! (Cash only for the buffet)", "What we had:\n- $15 Saturday dinner buffet 5/5\n- Veg Kottu Roti 5/5\n- Roti 4/5\n- Food was incredible! I will say, I don't have much experience with Sri Lankan food, however it is very similar to Indian food and the spices were perfect however not spicy at all -- but they do provide dry red and asian green chili if you need it. My favorites from the buffet were the mixed veg curry and the eggplant. I also love having raw onions on the side with my food and they had plain raw onions and a spiced / pickled onion mixture\n\nService: 5/5\n- The owner was so friendly and let us enjoy the buffet even though we arrived nearing kitchen closing time\n\nAmbiance: 500/5\n- Incredible and smells incredible too! They said all the pieces are from Sri Lanka and as soon as you step in, there are hundreds of details and decor to look at. Everything from the chairs to the hand washing station and the Ganesh statues\n\nOnly reason for us to make the trek to Staten Island!", "When one considers going out to eat \"exotic food\", the dreamy anticipation of something mysterious is what one hopes for. Lakruwana makes those dreams come true!\n\nBefore entering, there is a mural on the easterly wall that wraps the place up like a gift, unwrapping when you walk into this meticulously decorated restaurant. There is no detail abandoned. From the unusual high back iron chairs, the long carved mask menus and the buffet table where the food is served in clay pots. It is far from gimmicky.\n\nOn to the food!\nI shared with my dinner mates the the Assorted Sri Lankan Appetizers, a combination of 4 different types of highly spiced cutlets. Great to prepare yourself for the upcoming main courses! Complete and super tasty!\n\nI had the House Special, Lamprie: a quartet of Sri Lankan curries, vegetables and meat and served on a disc of basmati rice, which is steamed in a banana leaf and served in a basket. Simply perfect!  \n\nThere are no alcoholic drinks, but the server (whom I suspect was also the owner) welcomed us to walk up the street to buy a bottle of wine, which we did, after ordering.\n\nGO!", "A small cozy Sri Lankan restaurant in Staten Island. The restaurant had a very nice interior deco and the food was really good. They're currently doing outdoor dining in colorful tables with umbrella shades. I was super impressed by how fast all the items were made and brought to our table. Travelled all the way from Jersey with my friends just to get some authentic kothu.\n1) Lamb Lamprais : First time trying this dish. The lamb was tender and the gravy was just the right level of spiciness. The cashew curry was also pretty interesting.\n2) Fish Kothu Roti : 5/5 for this. The kothu was freshly made with a good amount of fish and vegetables. My only issue with this is that they should absolutely serve a bigger serving of fish gravy on the side with it. I'd emptied the small cup of curry in just 2 mins and had to ask for a refill.\n3) Assorted Appetizers : Presentation was great! A little more fish in the fish cutlet would have been nice.\n\n4 stars because they have a separate \"ask only\" menu for more dishes like Appam. I only found out about it after we were done eating. Sad. But I look forward to my next visit to try out the \"secret\" menu.", "I've been here many times. The decor is great, but it borders on crazy. Floor to ceiling Sri Lankan wood carvings and wall mounts. Everything you see or use feels like a Sri Lankan souvenir,... everything is imported, the chairs, the silverware, the plates, the cups, the pitchers. It's certainly a conversation starter.

Pizzas are big enough to share, but you're going to want your own. I got the veggie pizza, which had an olive garlicky spread, fennel, ripe tomatoes, mini squash and potato. Freaking delish. Boyfriend had the pepperoni. We also had a CHACO TACO!!!! Made with mint ice cream and nuts, there was nothing soggy or ice-burned about this childhood favorite dessert.\n\nCocktails are all based on Italian liquors, which is new for most. 24 beers on tap and a great selection of local brews.

I rarely extend out into the northern end of Little Italy but the radiating good vibes from this place were too inviting to ignore. It's exquisitely decorated and you can feel the energy before even entering it. The curling boards, LARGE televisions and open layout are welcoming for small groups and large. This is actually a perfect venue to bring the friends and catch the World Cup..or even play FIFA on Xbox with a buddy on the big screen.\n\nNolita Hall provides a place where you can not only stop in for some lunch/dinner, but also a drink with a group of friends. I wouldn't call it fine dine by any means though. They have some wood fired pizzas which are severely overpriced for the quality, but I really think you are paying for the ambiance/environment. The snap peas/carrots are a good starter - they are mixed into a pistachio/mint sauce and was my favorite part of the meal.\n\nOverall, a fun place to visit with friends for a drink, but I don't think it's a must go specifically for the lunch/dinner.", "Perfect spot for a date!

They did however just open a brand new outdoor seating area that is super cute! You need to specify that you want to sit there when making reservations (I haven't had the opportunity to enjoy it yet so this review will not cover it).\n\nInside there's a large bar, and some small bar tops in the bar area...

The drinks a very small and on average run $15 - a little pricey so either make this the first place you visit and then move on.\n\nOverall great vibe, great pizza and the drinks are overpriced for my taste but the interior design is worth the visit for one or two cocktails.", "Loved this place! It's so pretty and the food was great. Went with a friend and our toddlers for lunch. We had the scallop elote and gateway bird. Both were delicious, but that sandwich was THE BEST. Also tried the drinks: Nolita's prescription and Lara's Jam, they were ehh. Will try different drinks next time.

I always thought the food was just alright but after trying a super burrito, DORADO Style, my mind has been changed.\n\nIt's not listed on the menu anywhere, and all you have to do is ask for it when ordering. Dorado style is where they give your tortillas sometime on the grill and what it does it that it adds a level of crunch and crispness.  For me, I like crispy and crunchy foods, so it takes it to another level. If you aren't getting dorado style, you are missing out!\n\nThe flavors of the guacamole and pico de Gallo is super fresh. I got carne asada and I thought it was alright, i thought the meat was kinda dry and chewy, so I think I'd go carnitas next time around. Their green salsa is spicy and delicious, I have to put it on every bite. They don't put rice in the burrito, so I feel less full than I normally would for paying $14 for a super burrito, but overall still tasty.", "Make sure you get your burrito el dorado style! My friend didn't and let's just say he looked very jealous when he saw my burrito vs his. The burrito is a bit on the smaller end which is why I deducted 1 star but it is really tasty and has a good amount of meat inside. I also tried the super crispy taco which is almost the size of the burrito (which it should be costing at +$7). The super crispy taco has crispy corn tortilla covered with a regular corn tortilla stuffed with meat and the works. The strawberry Fresca was perfectly sweet with bits of strawberry inside. Overall the meal was great but a bit more on the expensive side for Mexican food. I personally prefer El Farolito down the street but would definitely give this place a go once in a while.", "La Taqueria was featured in one travel foodie channel  and it claimed that it's the #1 burrito to try in San Francisco.\n\nI've lived in SF and I regret  not going here sooner. They are known for their mission-style burritos which means no rice. El Dorado style is a must especially if you want the burrito to be quesadilla-like crispy. I know this is legit because it wasn't even 11am on a Sunday (their usual opening time) and there were about 25 people standing outside in line. People swarmed to save the tables as soon as it opened, and went straight to the cashier. So the way it goes is you pay first to order, they give you a number, and wait for your # to be called.\n\nThis is a cash-only establishment so make sure you bring at least $20. I had the carne asada burrito and it was nothing I have ever tasted before. Make sure to get it Super so they add all the 3 cheeses, sour cream and avocado. It costs me about $13 for the burrito alone so bring more than $20 cash if you want to order more.  If ever i have visiting friends out of town, I would definitely bring them here", "I was born and raised in San Francisco. I grew up in the Mission, on 26 and Capp and then 24 and Utah. I am very familiar with taquerias. La Taqueria might be the worst super burrito I have ever had.\n\nI ordered a Super Burrito with Cabeza (Cow Head). It was sad as hell. Nothing about this burrito sets itself apart from any other Taqueria and the lack of rice makes it even worse. Because of the lack of rice the burrito was barely filled and felt empty. This burrito does not warrant the title of \"Best Burrito in America\" . The beans overpower any kind of taste you might get from the unseasoned meat. And if you do manage to taste any protein it will be drowned by sour cream. This burrito is just a mess.\n\nI would rather walk down the street and go to literally any other Taqueria for a better burrito. El Farrolito has a much better super burrito.", "Game Changer. This place is so ridiculously fantastic it makes me happy just thinking about it. The Tacos Dorado is where it's at. I'm sure the burritos are good too but the tacos are insane. It's not just about the way they make the taco. It's everything. The meat is soo good, the guacamole is soo good, and the pico is soooo good. Every ingredient is thoughtful and prepared with quality ingredients and it shows in the end result! What you get is a little piece of heaven. To top it all off everyone is so nice that works here. I love this place. Please don't ever change. Big hugs for La Taqueria.", "This place is a gem!  You can probably expect the wait to order your food will be 15-25 minutes.  And most likely you will have to wait outside for a bit because of the line.  You will also need to be aware of parking, if you can plan to go alone you will need to put aside time for finding a park.  The serving sizes are enormous; the quesadilla is unlike anything you expect, it is made on an x-large tortilla and covered in 3/4 of an inch of your choice of meat along with cheese, avocado and sour cream.

Everything here is made from the freshest ingredients on a daily basis. I love knowing that they don't use ingredients different from the ones I use at home. The spicy galbi jjim is also really good, but note that you can taste the herbs and roots they use to cook it in (I'm personally not a huge fan).\n\nI went with my toddler and I was so impressed at how accommodating they were to us. They brought us out a small plate of rice and steamed egg for the baby even before all the banchan came out. This was perfect because my baby wanted to eat and was starting to get fussy. They also made sure to make the soybean paste soup less spicy (without the jalape\u00f1os) and with more tofu especially for the baby. They were so thoughtful and made the whole dining experience so much less stressful.

Here you get 10+ side dishes with free refills!  I haven't been to a place that serves that many outside of Korea.  Most of the side dishes tasted great and well prepared.  My table ordered the soy sauce marinated crab, baked mackerel w/ soy bean paste stew, and shrimp tofu pancake (I think).  Everything tasted pretty good and true to what is Korean.  I would like to mention that the everything was a bit salty.  So, I wouldn't consider this a healthy choice.  The mackerel had an uneven cook.  I'd be willing to come back to try other dishes.\n\nStaff is alright... the servers were clearly overwhelmed with a packed house.  They tried...

Unfortunately, I was just not a fan of it.

The Ganjang Gejang here isn't even that good. Just go to ShinJung if you really want one. They forgot to give us rice for like 20 minutes after the main dishes came out. They couldn't serve our third dish for another 15 minutes so we ended up just canceling it.

Probably because the 15 side dishes needed their own table.\n\nFriends told me about this place months ago but spurred by Daniel L's review, I insisted on coming to this place instead of keeping our reservation at some fancy place in Hollywood.\n\nKimchi jjigae (one of my favorite dishes in the world) was really tasty, the kimchi was well cooked, and I really liked the tofu texture/taste and the surprise bits of dduk. I'm definitely coming back to get it again!\n\nSpicy galbijjim was soooo soft and fell off the bone. It looked spicier than it tasted.

This was on a Tuesday night with a more or less empty bar and no other tables taken in the restaurant. They brought the wrong amount of oysters out and all the food came at various times, regardless of it was an appetizer or main entree. Everyone had finished and we were talking about dessert while still waiting on my friend's order of wings after over 40 minutes. It made the whole experience awkward, especially since the place was empty. The food was also not quite as described - for example the corn \"risotto\" was simply a barley salad with some corn and a fried egg on top. Not at all worth the price. The only thing I would recommend bothering to try are the fries. The vibe of the place was cool but they should have just stuck to keeping it a bar since the ambiance is cool. Big disappointment on the restaurant front.", "A group of friends and I had a somewhat nice evening at The Flower Shop. We arrived in time for Happy Hour (5-7, vague offerings) and found some seats in the back near the pool table. Two guys were playing a game and we settled in the for evening. After ordering a second round, a large party came in for the reserved section in the sunken area in the back (note: a lot of this place is reserved, even if you come early around 6 PM on a random week day). We were then told that this large party had reserved the whole back area, including the pool table and the seats we had been sitting in for about half an hour. Had we been told this from the start, it wouldn't have been an issue, but it was pretty poor service to ask paying guests to leave when it was never made clear they were sitting in a reserved spot. We finished our drinks near the bar and bounced. Weren't able to order food either as the kitchen was closed for the private event upstairs.

We tried the Beef Tartare ($16), which came with some crunchy potato chips for scooping, and the Marinated Beets ($13), with chunks of blue cheese and pistachios and pears, making for an excellent bite.\n\nMoving on, the Fried Chicken ($21) was pretty solid, but came with just a curry sauce and instead could have really benefited from some kind of side. The Burger ($16) was also pretty solid and came with the excellent, salty fries.\n\nThere's also actually an entire lower level, which is really cool.

Otherwise a major hit!", "The food is amazing. Come here with a big group so you can try a bunch of appetizers.  Our group of six tried the pig ear nachos - so good, topped with an over-easy egg which makes the dish even richer. Their guacamole is delicious, they have an awesome swiss chard quesadilla, and I even tried a taco that had shrimp and CRICKETS in it.  Not bad actually!  and their carnitas?  Made with pork belly.  So crispy yet tender... and delicious.  Loved loved loved the food. And it is all really reasonably priced.  (Although $5-6 for the small street-style tacos is maybe pushing it.) Drinks are good too, definitely try their margarita. The old fashioned made with reposado and mezcal is just ok, I guess I'm just an old fashioned purist.

Excellent sauce combined with the octopus and potato; highly recommended.\n\nThe plantains are sweet yet crispy, with a bit of saltiness from the sprinkle of cheese. Definitely a good side for sharing.\n\nFinally, the Pork Chaufa was a disappointment. It's heavy with fat and incredibly salty, and has large chunks of pork fat with skin attached. These are too large to eat in one bite and the bowl is not conducive to cutting with a knife, so the meat on these is a little hard to get off easily. Overall the salt and fat overwhelm the dish so I would not recommend it.\n\nOverall a restaurant with excellent food for the most part. Worth a trip for sure, though I would avoid the Pork Chaufa.", "The food is amazing!! The atmosphere is very welcoming. The staff were extremely friendly. We went on a Monday night and was able to have a table. It recently opened so its BYOB for now until they get their liquor license. It will soon open up for brunch. For now, it is open from 6pm-10pm.\n\nChef Jose did come to our table and check how the food was. One of the partners Miguel also checked on us and explained the shaved ice dessert and the chicha morada juice on it as well as the drink. He gave us the drinks to try. Those were amazingly delicious. Seems like a very healthy guiltless dessert. I'm surprised all the sweetness is from the purple corn.\n\nThis was our first time at any of the Mission Ceviche locations. It was pleasant and makes me curious about the other casual locations as well. Will definitely be coming back and also be bringing friends for a nice sit-down dinner.\n\nAt first look of the menu, we wanted to order everything, but we narrowed it down to one from each of the 4 categories. The classic catch of the day pollock Ceviche, Octopus Causas, jumbo shrimp skewer and the arroz con mariscos. All were very delicious", "This place had been on my list to try for a while. I had heard good things, and every time I walked past, it looked packed. So, I was really excited to try it last week. I knew I wanted some sort of ceviche, and the mixto did not disappoint...fresh seafood in flavorful, refreshing broth. I also knew I wanted pulpo because grilled octopus is always the answer. Perfectly cooked with a great balance of flavors, as well as presentation. The last dish was a bit of a surprise. My date and I were still hungry after not eating much all day, so we decided to order the seafood rice dish. The rice was cooked nicely and topped with lovely greens and seafood. I was pleasantly surprised, as I'm picky with paella-type dishes.\n\nI will say I was hoping to try the tres leches for dessert because it looked decadent at the tables of multiple Libras celebrating their birthdays (on a Wednesday, too!), however we decided to skip. I'll have to come back just for that, lol, and maybe a pisco sour.\n\nThe only complaints I have are that it's a bit loud for a date, though it's pretty inside, and sometimes it's difficult to flag down the waiter, but overall, this place is the real deal.", "Chef Jos\u00e9 Luis Chavez just opened a new location of his Mission Ceviche, but it's very different from his first two locations.\n\nThe first two were also great, but were very much fast casual, while this is a much nicer sit-down restaurant.

Definitely try the Classic Ceviche ($14) and the Octopus Causa ($16).", "Mission ceviche has a great reputation, and stays busy, somewhat proving their popularity.\nWhile considered \"Peruvian\", it seems more of a trendy bistro with loud, lively music (not Peruvian, not even South American) and artistic takes on traditional dishes.\n\nServings tend to be small, yet pricey. Ceviche ($16-$19) is served more chopped than the usual limey / sliced onion style of more traditional Peruvian ceviche. They added chunks of sweet potatoes.\n\nAn order of sweet plantain comes with just one platano sliced into bites, served with parmesan cheese. Tasty, but tiny for $9.\n\nThey do offer several vegan/vegetarian dishes. Drinks are good, but I didn't appreciate that the waitress encouraged me to add a smoother spirit to my cocktail (without letting me know there would be an extra $2 charge).

I enjoyed this dish, but it was my least favorite out of everything we ordered.\n\nRazor Clams - These were cooked to perfection! It had the right amount of chewiness and was seasoned with olive oil, lime and herbs.\n\nCreamy Eggs with sea urchin - I was not expecting this dish to be one of my favorites. The eggs were cooked to perfection and had such great flavor. The sea urchin, walnuts, and anchovies oil with the creamy eggs meshed so well together! 10/10\n\nScallops with serrano peppers - This dish almost had an asian/thai influence to it. The sauce tastes like a green curry and the scallops are were soft and cooked well! I also enjoyed the cashews this dish offered.\n\nBread Pudding - Who doesn't love a good bread pudding? This dish was a fabulous way to end the meal! Comes with a scoop if icecream on top. The bread pudding wasn't extremely sweet and wasn't overcooked. Must get!

But you really can't complain when you order 5+ tapa-sized dishes a couple of glasses of beer, wine and coffee and your bill comes out to less than $120???

There were four of us and we ordered around twelve to fifteen dishes. The tapas that left the most impression as follows:\n\nFluke crudo ginger broth, soy pickled shallots and blood orange - my absolute favorite of our meal. This is an appetizer full of layers and hidden surprises. Soy pickled shallot seemed to have been fried, so there was the crispy and crunchy texture. Ginger broth and blood orange was on the zesty side, bringing the fruity and refreshing flavor to the dish. Taking a bite of the fluke with the combination of above was an absolute delight.\n\nCreamy eggs with sea urchins, walnuts, lime and ancient anchovy was also a top choice amongst the group. Creamy not overly scrambled eggs scrambled to perfection topped with flavorful yet sweet sea urchin. Top the dish with French baguette created a well balanced perfection.\n\nRazor clams a la plancha was a disappointment. It looks fantastic and smells amazing with toppings of garlic but the razor clams were over cooked and too salty for our taste.\n\nPro tip: note that the dishes generally comes with generous seasoning of sodium, I would strongly recommend letting the waiter know you want reduced sodium for all the dishes.", "Setting: Tightly placed formation of tables in a small overall floor space\nStaff: Staff were friendly with great knowledge of the food and drinks, able to give well informed advice\nFood: Delicately cooked dishes that packed much flavour as one would expect for a multiple awardee of a Michelin star. Stand out dish for me was the baby squid\nOverall: Was a pleasant experience in the relatively short time we were there due to turning up with no booking and having to vacate for incoming reservations, its do-able for 2 people but more than that will be problematic without a booking.

I made a reservation for an early dinner here for my mom and I and as soon as we walked in, we were impressed. The overall aesthetic is stunning. We were seated immediately and the waitress brought us breadsticks and \"bomba\" which was basically a tapenade made out of calabrian chilies, roasted artichokes, garlic and many other ingredients but it was very memorable. So much so that my mom asked to purchase some. We then ordered the heirloom tomatoes for an appetizer. Not sure why its called heirloom tomatoes because it really is more of a caprese salad with the highlight being the homemade mozzarella moreso than the heirloom tomatoes. I recommend asking for bread to come with it!\n\nFor entrees' we ordered the branzino and the casarece. Branzino was fresh and sizeable and the casarece pasta was perfectly al dente, and overall a decadent experience. I ate the whole thing with no regrets! The meal culminated with the olive oil cake (of course) of which the fior di latte gelato was the highlight. I will certainly be back here to explore more of the pastas as well as some of the crudo options!", "Highly recommend!!!\n\nCame on a Saturday night for dinner at 6:45.

Based on how busy it gets, most people love this place. very tasty food. Every dish is well thought. Inspiring flavors, that are usually paired with a great sauce. My sister who is a chef says a good sauce is a sign of good chefs. I believe this place is owned by two chefs? I usually get raman and always adda side of house made kimchi, which was suggested by another friendly patron at the bar. Speaking of bar, great cocktail, and specialty Japanese drinks, like beers, whisky and yuzu flavored drinks. great non alcoholic beverages as well. Everything is so good that it is often hard to save room for desert. But you should. My favorite is the black sesame ice cream which, is so so so good. It is so good. with green tea meringues , and coconut granola-which is more like crunchy toasted shavings of coconut which add a surprising texture to the mix, Oh, and Carmel sauce. so good. Everything here is good. They even have Gluten free options! And take out is easy with nice presentation... just love this place.", "Amazing ramen in Sebastopol?

I live right near Orenchi Beyond in SF, which is also remarkable, but this place blew my mind. My boyfriend and I both had the spicy tan tan ramen, which was wonderfully rich and spicy.

I had the salmon benedict and thought it was well constructed and executed with honey adding a sweetness which complimented the saltiness of the salmon, I couldn't really taste the yoghurt but that wasn't a big deal (could have done with a little more honey though).  The big deal was, however, that the salad was extremely salty almost to the point of being inedible; I finished everything on the plate but that (same as my friend) and another friend lamented how salty the salad was after his first bite.\n\nI would have given Baker & Co closer to 4 stars but the salad killed it, not in a good way.  \n\nI liked this restaurant though and will ask for \"dressing on the side\" next time.", "Loved the feel of this narrow bar/restaurant.

But if you're not feeling a pasta for brunch, I also love their Meatballs and Polenta dish. It's super filling and just feels hearty.\n\nFor some reason they are also known for their frose.

You can tell they prided themselves in letting the ingredients speak for themselves.\nBucatini with lamb.. lovely with a little kick. Full of flavor and not drowned in cheese. Everything was well balanced.\nDrinks - the frose was delicious but very sweet. The Fall frose while also sweet tastes like a sparkling sangria. Very great starter.\nWe ordered all the desserts for the table. Highly recommend the hazelnut gelato! So creamy and tasted just like Nutella!\nThe only reason I couldn't give this place a 5 is the ambiance. We were in a corner booth and the lighting was so low, it was hard to read menus. We had to break out the iPhone flashlights.\nIt also got so loud that you'd end up yelling to the gal sitting right next to you.\nAlthough the service can be slow at times, our food came out so quick!

A delicious new pasta spot by Chef Andrew Carmellini.  The pasta dishes are not too large- so don't feel shy about ordering a few and sharing (I didn't!)  The unique dish here is definitely the fiore di carciofi- a long egglike noodle filled with artichoke and topped with cheese and bacon.   My favorite dish of the evening was the lamb buccatini.  Albeit a little simple- the pasta was al dente perfection and had a spice to it that was a delightful surprise.  #pastafordays", "Came here for a company dinner and it did not disappoint.  Everything we had was very tasty and well executed.  My group started off with the cauliflower appetizer and the meatballs.  The cauliflower was probably the best I've ever had and so full of flavor (the topping of grated cheese definitely helped) and nicely balanced with the grapes and toasted almonds.  The meatballs were tender and juicy and I could have definitely eaten the entire plate if I didn't have to share.  My group also shared the spaghetti with clams and the short rib ravoli.  Both pastas were excellent and had a nice spicy kick at the end.\nI would say the only not perfect item we had was the strip steak.  I had asked for mine to be medium and it was more like well done so it was kind of dry.  \nOverall, a great dining experience from the crowd to the service to the food.  I would definitely go back.", "If pasta is supposed to be the star of your restaurant, it better shine.  On paper the pastas sounded interesting but fell very short to my expectations.  \n\nFirst, why are the pasta portions so small if there aren't any true mains offered except for the daily special?\n\nSecond, how is it possible that the quality of the pasta dishes are dramatically lower here compared to Locanda Verde, which serves some of the best pasta anywhere? I understand that they wanted to create a more casual restaurant with Bar Primi, but I'd rather pay more for a satisfying product.\n\nThe only thing that saved the meal was The Sandwich, which consists of the most tender warm roast beef and perfectly melted provolone.

I first visited Sushi Dokku due to the overwhelming 5 star reviews on Yelp and they sure lived up to the hype!\n\nThis was our 3rd visit to Sushi Dokku and everytime we have tried different cocktails, maki rolls, and desserts.\n\nThis visit we had the calamari appetizer and edemame. Calamari was cooked the perfection and virtually no excess oil on them, they also came with a delicious dipped sauce.\n\nWe split 4 rolls: Dragon, Northern California, Fire, and Smoked Salmon. They were all wonderful! My only issue with the rolls was that although the fire roll was said to be spicy I did not think it was at all.\n\nI tried their seasonal Chili Mojito which had a chili infused gin, mint, and homemade sour. I highly recommend it if you are one who enjoys a nice bite with their meal.\n\nFor dessert we had the green tea cheesecake with brownie crust, espresso mochi, tirimasu mochi, lychee sorbet, and some sort of apple cake with a homemade caramel sauce and ginger ice cream. Their lychee sorbet was spot on. It was sweet and refreshing after such a saucy and delicious meal. The other desserts were almost just as delicious but my heart goes out to the lychee sorbet!\n\nWonderful experience and will be returning on our next trip to the big city!", "I will always come back to this place for the Tako Yaki & Hama Kama.  Not only are those things fun to say when you order them, but they are both super delicious!  The Tako Yaki are these amazing fried octopus balls, which come out piping hot w/ smoked onion flakes on top that actually move in waves from the steam.  The dish appears to be breathing as it is served to you.  The Hama Kama is the neck or \"collar\" from the  Himachi which you can order grilled or fried.  The grilled is so good, I've no desire to even try the fried, but I'd bet money it's equally as  yummy.  In addition to my two staples, the sushi is always fresh, the drinks are strong, the wine is refreshingly good, and they will split the ramen in two dishes for you if you want to share it.  We learned about the Tako Yaki & Hama Kama by sitting at the bar & watching dishes go out to other tables.  I highly recommend bar seating if you want a good education on what is special from this restaurant.  The service is also top-notch, and the servers know the menu inside and out.", "Best sushi in Chicago. Without a doubt. We sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed watching everything being prepared in front of us. We were impressed with how finely the chef sliced the avocado for the tuna truffle nigiri. They don't take presentation lightly here.\n\nWe also ordered the hamachi appetizer and enjoyed the spice of the jalapeno that came with it. We also ordered the Hot Daisy roll and the Tuna Microgreens roll. The Hot Daisy is a must. It was spicy and the flavors were well balanced. We could have eaten three of those rolls. The sauce was a little heavy on the Tuna Microgreens roll.\n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful, yet simple -- large windows, mostly wood finishes and dim lighting. Great for a night out, or for a date.", "I was apprehensive about Sushi Dokku since Sushi Wabi had deteriorated in quality rather severely before closing, but I figured a fresh start deserves a second chance.  I was wrong.\n\nOn the day of my visit, nigiri and rolls were being served with white rice, not sushi rice.  This is completely unacceptable - its doesn't even taste like sushi without that rice.  Not only that, but it wasn't even cooked completely, and I was getting hard kernels in the nigiri and rolls. Nigiri pieces disintegrated when dipped into the soy sauce.\n\nThe second thing I noticed was the fish is hidden behind the bar.  They don't have those clear cases you expect at a sushi place.  Sushi is supposed to be ultra fresh, and displaying it openly allows customers to check quality, as well as monitor preparation.  The nigiri pieces were dry as if they had been cut hours before then slapped on the rice as orders came in.  Everything was very bland and dry, and the al dante white rice didn't help.\n\nThe \"bites\" menu was an interesting concept - nigiri pieces topped with roll components -  but two selections we tried underwhelmed.  The salmon with avocado on top featured that same old dried out sake, and a scallop bite was so heavy with mayonnaise I wanted to hurl after swallowing it.", "Ambiance: Didn't get a chance to see the inside but they do have seating available both indoors and out. We opted for a patio table and they even asked if we prefer a table in the sun or the shade!\n\nService: Interesting service... The waiter seemed annoyed in our first interaction but the second time he said one thing sarcastically but then said \"just kidding\" and was nice from there on.\n\nFood: We shared the Miso Salmon, Dragon, and Spicy Octopus rolls. My favorite was either the Miso Salmon because of the chunky salmon pieces on top or the Dragon, since you can't go wrong with that! The Spicy Oct was pretty good but we both thought you could taste the caviar more than anything else. Some pieces def felt a little too crunchy because of it.\nFor drinks I had the Crane's Landing.

It took them a while to help us order and the food also came out pretty slowly.\n\nThe three of us shared a ham and cabbage soup, spicy stir-fry pork belly with peppers, chicken in chili oil, and salt and pepper squid. The best thing we had was probably the soup- it had a deep and rich pork broth and was sooo comforting on a cold day. I know ham and cabbage soup doesn't sound so appetizing but Try it! The pork belly was a little over cooked, and the squid and chicken were pretty average. Portion sizes were decent. I honestly prefer Szechuan Garden a few minutes away for similar food.

Another plus, I thought at first: it was delivered (about 1/2 mile) *incredibly fast,* maybe in 25 mins. But now I wonder, were 2 dishes already cooked, just reheated? Because....the squid appetizer in spiced salt was tough (often a problem with squid, of course), and the taste was just ok. Tough also describes the tiny spare rib bits in sweet and sour sauce; they tasted pleasant, but I've had much more appealing ribs at Ollies. Spinach as an appetizer was flavorful, juicy, not overcooked. [Update: I actually concluded that was *under*-cooked... meaning 3 of the 4 dishes were tough to chew, tho that one could be remedied.]\nSo... are they overwhelmed since the Michelin review?

Juicy, buttery, marbled meaty fat. Buttered blue crab on top adds a nice brine.\nA side of Creamed Spinach tastes fresh and perfect, and they weren't kidding about the Butter Laden Mashed Potatoes. They're so saturated the butter skims out on top, a glistening puddle of no regrets.\nGiant slices of Chocolate Devil's Food Cake are almost the size of a steak.

The place was packed on a Saturday night and the bar area was full and loud.  A bit too loud for us but we only had to wait about 10 min. for our table.  We tried to get a drink at the bar but the bartender never came our way.\nOnce seated, our waiter greeted us immediately and explained the menu and how they would like us to order everything at once. We chose some wine and began looking over the menu.  I suffer from a lot of food intolerances (no onion, garlic, gluten), so I usually have a difficult time finding something to eat.  I ended up with the Filet Mignon and the Shrimp Cocktail appetizer.  We also had the mashed potatoes and broccolini.  The food was all cooked very well and was very tasty.  The service was good for a busy Saturday evening, and the manager stopped by a few times for a chat which was appreciated.  The prices are high with most glasses of wine over $20 so be prepared for this.  All in all, a great experience the second time around, thank you!", "Amazing steakhouse, and coming from a non-beef eater, that means a lot! Came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary last night and both husband and I were blown away by how delicious the food was and how incredible the service was.\n\nFirst, since it was our anniversary, similar to other posts they surprised us with complimentary champagne and a signed card from the restaurant staff :-) Our waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable about the steak cuts and wines.\n\nNext, food! Tuna tartare and parker house rolls are MUST orders, along with the beef fat fries. Husband got the steak sampler and really loved the wagyu. I got the grilled whole branzino which was grilled to perfection. The wine selection was excellent (get the 2015 Hermitage) and dirty gin martini was nicely done.\n\nHighly recommend for a special occasion or business dinner. Think we might make this our anniversary spot from now on :-)", "David LeFevre's The Arthur J is a gorgeous 60's kitschy steak house that is as wonderful as any of his restaurants.  On the pricey side so maybe save it for  a special occasion or for that hot date night for you and your love.\nThe interior is a warm throw back in time to that mad men era. I love D.F.'s concepts for his three MB restaurants and the execution of the menu is always on point as are his staff.  \nSo if you're  up for some steak and a martini stop in and relax Chef LeFevre has you covered.", "This is the place to have a great ( not good) but great.

A couple friends and I shared various dishes, hoping to sample as many items as possible. We began with the French onion soup which was well crafted, but it was nothing out of the ordinary. This was  followed by the similarly well prepared foie gras--again, a reiteration of a classic dish. We were excited by the description of the Trofie noodles, but ended up most disappointed by the dish. A curious amalgam of pasta in a soup of sweet apples and fishy broth just didn't meet our expectations for innovative flavors, so we had to send it back. Furthermore, the black truffles on top lacked depth and ended up tasting sweet. We ordered the caviar service, which was good, but also lacked the usual punch of flavor. The quail was extremely tough and the lamb was very linear in taste. It relied on the meat to carry the flavor palette. At this point in the meal, we were turned off by the lackluster experience and opted to forgo desert. For the price point and heritage of the restaurant, it was ultimately a disappointing experience.", "This is a very fine restaurant that is doing most everything right. The chef's eight-course tasting menu, which is available on request, is the way to go here. It's assembled to match your tastes, and is a great way to experience the menu's highlights.\n\nEach course was beautifully presented. The only truly amazing one was the vichyssoise, but everything else was quite good, and the price was reasonable for the quality.\n\nService was informative and attentive, and the secondary service staff were particularly efficient at delivering and clearing.\n\nBrindille has one of the better wine lists in town, at a reasonable markup of about twice retail. It's heavy on quality French wines, and bears a bit of research before your visit to be truly rewarded.", "Lovely.  That's the word that I use to describe Brindille when telling friends to eat there.  Not going to lie, it's expensive, but the food and experience are well worth it.  Most notably, their sauce work is impeccable. Service was super professional while remaining friendly and totally un-pretentious.  The dining room is quiet and simple yet classy, and the diners were dressed appropriately (no jackets required, but don't go in your schlubby jeans either - have some respect for what they are doing there).", "Lovely fine dining. Aperitif was wonderful. Recommend the steak tatar for those who enjoy mustard and the oysters for anyone and everyone. Roasted chestnut soup was, again, just lovely. Hunter's plate was unique and tasty. Careful not to fill up on bread and honied butter ahead of time. Had to leave before dessert, which was just too bad. Crab pour commencer was also nice paired with serrano ham.", "Very delicious. My favorite were the oysters and the foie gras (actually my wife had foie gras but I have tasted a fair share of it). I had the lobster after that which was good but the shrimp which comes with the lobster was for my taste a little undercooked (though I like a lot of raw fish, for some reason I don't like shrimp sashimi). Cheese plate with calvados for dessert is the perfect finish.\nThe servers are very friendly and polite. The decoration of the restaurant is nice and it feels comfortable and warm. I especially like the design of the bathroom downstairs. The atmosphere and feel is like in a Michelin starred restaurant.

Definitely foodie territory, though still quite approachable (much like its sibling, Naha, down the street).\n\nVIBE: Understated elegance, but comfortable. Muted tones, restrained d\u00e9cor, somewhat dim lighting. Romantic -- a nice choice for that very special date.\n\nSERVICE: Everyone was personable, warm, helpful and well-trained.\n\nGOOD: Bison short rib was rich and nicely put together. (In fact, every dish was rich and nicely designed & presented.) Ditto sweetbreads and rabbit confit.\n\nNOT SO GOOD: Lobster was tasty, but way chewier than I prefer. Banquette seat was not so comfortable after 90 minutes. Wines by the glass did not deliver good value, in my view.\n\nAs might be expected in a fine French-inflected restaurant, richness was a hallmark of every dish. This was fun for a splurge, but frankly was a bit heavy for me -- I'm more into vibrant flavors, lighter textures and smaller portions. I would have enjoyed it more if the portions had been smaller (at a commensurately lower price, of course). Glad I tried it, though, and I would recommend it for those seeking a tony meal and rich French fare.", "The food and service here were excellent. It is very pricey, especially the wine list, making it more of a special occasion restaurant.

But despite the hip digs, it\u2019s all about food here.The fine-tuned menu features Israeli salads, dips and kebabs, but small plates are its heart and soul. Start with salatim, a five-salad starter. Then choose from dishes such as charred eggplant with herbed labneh, fried cauliflower with tahini and raisins or pomegranate-glazed chicken liver. The list goes on, but one thing to never skip is the hummus. It\u2019s so much more than the usual that it\u2019s even listed as a daily special. Keeping in line with the spirit is their Israeli- and Greek-focused wine list.", "yelp_reviews": ["I came here with a friend a few days ago with a friend.

We did order something else but we finished eating everything and when we were done it still hadn't come so we told them we don't want it anymore. The favorite thing we ordered was definitely the hummus. It was creamy and seasoned well. The next best thing I'd say was the roasted halumi. The salmon was a little undercooked for me but had good flavor.\n\nThe service was ok. Our server seemed busy and getting some of our dishes took a while.

Their falafel is the best I've had anywhere. Adding honey, a handful of pickles and a heap of tahini to a plate of chicken schnitzel is a welcome take on a Tel Aviv favorite.\n\nThe atmosphere of Sababa is cozy and intimate. It's almost always full of happy diners, so make a reservation or be prepared to wait, especially on a weekend. Opt to sit upstairs for a bit more quiet, and there's an adjoining rooftop terrace that's open for alfresco dining in the warmer months.", "Our server was patient as we perused  the menu.  \nThe subdued warm lighting and understated decor made us feel at home.\nBut my 5 stars are mostly about the food.\nLet's start with the smoked trout small plate.   Really smokey trout morsels in a complex muhammara sauce.  OK.  I looked it up.  Peppers, bread crumbs, walnuts, garlic, lemon juice, pomegranate molasses, cumin, hot peppers, salt, EVOO.  No wonder the end result was a decadent medley of flavors.  And I didn't even get to the grilled cucumbers.  I highly recommend the smoked trout.\nOn to the charred eggplant.  A blend of herbs in a yogurt sauce with pomegranate and pistachios, help enhance the smokey eggplant.  Can something this healthy really taste this good?\nSmall plate number 3.  Grilled broccoli.  They are set over a tahini sauce that contains charred broccoli pieces, roasted garlic, and chili oil.  The heat of the chili comes on late, and remains in the background where it belongs.\nWe concluded with the large plate lamb shank.  5 hours in a low heat oven left the lamb uber tender and falling off the bone.  Little cherry tomatoes for color, and a bed of bulgar wheat with onions, fennel, and preserved lemon.\nWe loved this meal from start to finish.\n\"Bon Appetite!\"", "I had Sababa for the first time last night. My original plan had been to order from Bindaas next door, but it was closed. Luckily the phone line is shared with Sababa (same management) which was open, so I just decided to order from Sababa instead. It was excellent!! Such delicious and interesting flavors. The salmon kebab and the charred eggplant were favorites. I live close by and don't go out much, but I will definitely be ordering from them again.

Of these good food is the easiest to find and hospitality the most elusive.  If you just want great food there are many food trucks which can deliver this. The perfect restaurant carefully prepares each dish and then pairs that with a wine or beverage. The somm, wait staff and chef should discuss these issues daily and then deliver to the diner as though they are old friends or family.\nAt Marche the service, food, wine and ambiance combine to deliver a great dining experience but hospitality is virtually absent. Some excellent values on the wine list including both white and red burgundy. A very nice Puligny Montrachet by the glass also. For food, the octopus is very excellent. The hamachi is fantastic. Very nice coq au vin and the cod special is a little different and flavorful.  Still the quality is a bit up and down and the menu quite large.

Star.\n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nThe portions at Hippo are a bit small, but the prices aren't unreasonable.

Star.\n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nThis was good stuff all around. Cauliflower is approaching the point of being overdone, but this was uniquely plated and I loved the addition of Tahini sauce to the dish. From there, the Tagliatelle was very good with fresh made pasta that really lapped up the sauce in a way that it should do.

Started with the rye berries and burrata, followed by the yellowfin tuna. Then had the sweet corn cappellacci and ended on the cedar smoked trout.

It was tangy, sweet with a little heat: just the perfect appetizer.\n-The butternut squash cappellacci, with browned butter, amaretti & sage is an old item on the menu and very good, (maybe too much butter ) but the flavors were there.\n-The taglioni with duck ragu was slightly too tomatoey for my taste but the portion was generous and the pasta well cooked.\n-The rose wine from Lodi was average and could have been served more chilled.\nIn sum, a nice experience and again, kudos for the very nice servers and Harry the host.\n-We will come back for sure !", "Located in the hip highland park area this fun restaurant features modern American and Italian food.

They're not AVPN certified but they follow most of the guidelines (i.e. imported 00 flour and tomatoes), while their cheeses and fresh meats are local.\n\nI ordered the Salsiccia and it was delicious. It was quite wet toward the center as expected but the crust had a nice char and toothiness. I personally prefer a little less char on the crust and a little more  crisp, but this style certainly has its appeal. I was already dreaming about the pizza before I was finished with the last slice, and that's always a sign of a good pie.\n\nThe brick oven was apparently flown in from Italy, and caused quite the stir when it was installed.

I'm pretty sure few tourists venture into Sottocasa because even though it's on a main thoroughfare, Atlantic Avenue, it's off the beaten path - literally. I walked by it a couple times looking for it because it's a few steps down from street level. It is worth finding. The dining room is small, room for two dozen, maybe 30 tops. It's a neighborhood place with a warm and comfortable vibe. And the pizzas are sublime. I ordered the Sassicia (sausage, basil and mozzarella with freshly made tomato sauce). Simply heavenly! The ingredients are in perfect harmony and each bite is wonderful! And the crust! Maybe the best part. Your server puts a bottle of olive oil on your table; use it for your crust. Yum!!! I concluded my dinner with a delightful biscotti plate and cappuccino. The next night I had the Diavola pizza - spicier sausage, same conclusion: delicious. Something I didn't order but wished I had was the arugula salad; the couple next to me did, and when the server brought it I could smell the dressing: like lemon and olive oil.

Following that, we devoured the Laura and Burrata pizzas -- both were delicious, but I think the Laura was my favorite. That was definitely enough food for the three of us, and we left very satisfied.\n\nAmbiance was very comfortable and the place felt just the right amount of crowded (we were still able to be seated right away for a Friday night!) The servers were also very attentive, as three of them would come over at different points throughout the meal to see if we needed anything.\n\nIf I were being picky, my only complaint was the glass of wine I ordered felt like it wasn't the most generous pour, but maybe it was the small, stem-less glass that created that illusion. Not sure if I got the most bang for my buck with the wine.\n\nRegardless, I can't wait to come back and try some of these other pizzas!", "Sotto Casa translates from Italian into English as \"The House,\" which is appropriate because I live above it.

That's magic and worth every penny (though their prices, for this kind of food, is on the low side compared to similar but not as good spots in Manhattan.)\n\nI suppose my only complaint is that they don't operate a full kitchen which means there are so many tasty things they aren't making. Maybe they simply need another location?", "The pizza is excellently made and with ingredients as fresh as you can ask for.

I also did not like sitting next to the cashier where it happen to be the dirty dishes area so they would bang the dishes a lot and it was incredibly loud.\n\nThe food itself was okay.

We ordered everything to share - Burrata, meatballs, papperdelle, tater tots, and vanilla flan. Everything was mediocre, in my opinion. The meatballs were what I was looking forward to, but it was kind of disappointing. It lacked flavor and was a bit dry. The Burrata was only OK as well - I've had better.

Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, like some of my best friends.\n\nThen we split the FREEDMAN'S REUBEN and the MATZOH BALL SOUP, which you can order for two or four people.

Face the kitchen and you can watch them  hand pull noodles, face the front and you can watch food videos and Japanese cartoons. Service is quick, but not friendly. They're trying to move tables because there is a crowd outside waiting to get in.\n The food was very good. We ordered several dim sum for the four of  us, and then some ramen soup bowls...vegetable, spicy beef, and shrimp with dao xiao hand cut noodles. We started with steamed pork soup buns, pan fried shrimp and pork dumplings, scallion  pancakes with sliced beef, steamed mushroom and bok choy buns, pan fried Peking Duck buns...which helped cool off our mouths Fe rom the spicy beef ramen soup. We finished with Sweet Babao Rice for desert, loaded with formerly dried fruits.\n One caveat, in small print on the bottom of the menu, they include a 15% gratuity before you get the bill...and It's not easily noticed on the bill.", "The place is open again :)\n\nTo reiterate: Watch out for the double tip! The receipt total already includes the tip, so if you are inattentive, you could end up paying a double tip, which is admittedly kinda shady...\n\nThat being said... This is the best spot for xiao long bao (soup dumplings) in Midtown. An order of 6 dumplings will run you about $9, which is pretty typical of the area. These soup dumplings are far better than those found at Joe's Shanghai. They have a decently strong flavor and plenty of soup. The dumpling skin is a bit too thick for my tastes, but this is the best you are gonna get for authentic Chinese food in midtown.\n\nFor the other dishes, I would skip the pan fried dumplings since they were almost entirely bread and almost no meat. I also found the scallion pancakes to be a bit too oily. But, almost all of their noodle dishes I've had here are really great. And don't forget Chinese ramen is NOT Japanese ramen!!\n\nThe venue is very small so don't come here with a large party.

The duck buns are my guilty pleasure - they're sweet and greasy and rich - I wish you could buy them one at a time because two feels like too many for one person (and I'm often eating with the vegetarian husband). The noodles aren't traditional Japanese ramen, as others have mentioned, but rather Chinese hand-pulled noodles, which is fine, as long as you aren't expecting Japanese ramen. I prefer the buns and dumplings to the noodles after trying both the cold and stir-fried versions. The soup dumplings seemed about the right thickness to make it to my spoon without breaking, but still feel delicate. Eat them fast so that they won't stick to the paper and break (my technique is to bite off the top bit, suck out most of the soup, then put the whole thing in my mouth - do not attempt on first date).", "This place serves really solid, flavorful, quality, and authentic Chinese food, but the price point is a bit too steep. I would say it's about 2-3x more expensive than Chinatown, and whether or not it's worth the trip depends on the trek (if it's worth going downtown) and variety of quality foods offered here (there are MANY excellent options on the menu), much more so than the ambiance, because the quarters are cramped in a similar way to c-town.\n\nFood wise - I've tried pretty much everything but the ramen, and I can say it's quality. The pan friend noodles are delicious - noodles are hand pulled and have great texture. The best dish based on friend consensus is the pan fried soup dumplings - these are AMAZING and a great point of differentiation. The scallion and egg dumpling thing (it's very large, more like a pocket) is also good, as are the beef-wrapped scallion pancakes.\n\nThere's nonexistent service but they're quick to pick up orders and refill water.\n\nAmbiance sucks and is comparable to Chinatown. You'll probably have to share a large table, but it's a fine trade-off given the food.", "A small and busy little place with very attentive staff. Spicy noodles were on point and full of favor. Please only order if you like really spicy. Also ordered spicy wonton soup which was also delish. Ordered a side of mushroom bok choy puffs which were very good. We finished with black bean puffs- fried outside but gooey black bean inside...great texture. All Worth it!", "I frequent this place because I live close by, and their food is pretty good. However, as may other Yelp reviewers noted, the bill automatically tacks on a 15% tip, but once they give you the credit card bill to sign, you only see the total amount of the bill, plus another line for additional tip above the signature line... thus, be careful not to double-tip unintentionally. I think the practice is a little dishonest, and while the food is good, I would rather go to another restaurant that is more honest with its tipping system.", "Very tasty.

Other great finds here are the oysters on a half shelf, which are always fresh and those oh so yummy crab cakes. It's easy to do crab cakes bad, but at this place, they are just different from the classic crab cakes most of restaurants have on their menu.

I have been trying to try the entire menu and I still have about 40% to go (I won't give up until I taste everything). So far I have liked every dish I have been able to try, however, I really think the Ciopinno and the Dugeness Crab are the finest.

But next time, it'll be a work or client outing only.", "Wow. This place lives up to the hype in a big way. The service was slightly overbearing, so I would say this is a real life 4.5 stars, but I am rounding up because the pastas are simply divine.\n\nWe started with bites of squash blossoms and octopus skewers, which were all seasoned well and nicely thought out. We also split the crudo, which was very well balanced with spice and acid, and had a slight textural crunch.\n\nThe caico is the signature dish for a reason; perfect simplicity. The pappardelle was beautifully cut, and accompanied by a rich pork sugo, that was cut with some local peppers. But the star for me was the spaghetti. I can't believe how much truffle was shaved over top of this dish. The corn added a sweet pop, while the anchovy brought some salty funk to the earth party from the truffles. Perfection.\n\nMy \"shakerato\" nightcap was a perfect end to the meal, which had a strong kick from the bold espresso.\n\nWe also saw the chef walking around, so it was nice to know she was in the building.", "Absolutely fantastic and much more than expected!  My guest and I had a marvelous and memorable meal!  A terrific bottle of wine from a very nice list to begin.\n\nThe food was seriously fantastic.  We began with the octopus and Japanese sweet potato.  Tender and very flavorful.  Then we migrated to the eggplant with an amazingly crispy and tasty skin.  Never had anything like it before.  We thought it would be the meal's highlight, but then they brought the pumpkin ravioli.  Unbelievable!  Truly unbelievable!  Creamy smooth, flavorful, but a very appealing mild pumpkin.  Finished off with the pork chop and were not disappointed.\n\nThey brought out a slice of ice cream cake for the birthday person and it was a perfect ending.  The meringue was the best we had ever had and the chocolate sauce beneath it was heavenly.\n\nFabulous all around --- and friendly great service too!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/monteverde-chicago?hrid=e1xzD5q_AVg5GymGL3XVcw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/monteverde-chicago?hrid=YfUU2wZU6dDWfy98zclgJQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/monteverde-chicago?hrid=9vlH3gcp_2gcYnfgjWO6SA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/monteverde-chicago?hrid=EYdr5fYQquiFW5d3BZU1Vw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/monteverde-chicago?hrid=XaOgfIGtPmIy8vUTaAipZg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/monteverde-chicago?hrid=-ged3_1jMOWpt-PsN54QJA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Ronan", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/ronan-los-angeles/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/ronan", "michelin_pov": "Aim for the two-story floral mural to find this Italian favorite with a dive bar-feel and plenty of LA style.

I've never talked to so many other tables at a restaurant before. The food is amazing. The sea bass is one of a kind. You can order it with a friend and need nothing else. It can feed 4 people. Might be one of the iconic dishes in all of LA. I was so impressed.  Creative menu. I would try anything here and I am picky. Seems like a pizza place but it is so much more. The smell of the wood fire is amazing. The room is very attractive. They nailed it. This is definitely a place you can go to impress but also make it your weekly spot.

Great vibe, fun, energetic music and some of the best food I've had in a while.  I live in NYC and spend a lot of time in Italy so am very particular about my pizza.  This pizza was life changing.  The pizza oven was flown in from Naples and creates the best thin chewy middle and bubbly crust. My favorite is the margherita with added sopressata (must add!). The burrata is THE BEST burrata I've had on the west coast.  The house made sourdough with fresh butter is also an absolute must get!! Salads are also light and flavorful to add some vegetables to the mix.  The cocktails are not only delicious but cute and fun.  Mine had a disco ball in it!

Counting down for my next LA trip as this has taken over as my #1 spot!", "The appetizers here were the stars for us. I really enjoyed the caesar salad and the clams. The clams come with a huge piece of bread (which is just their pizza dough) covered in cheese. Delicious.\n\nWe also ordered the spicy chomper and the french dip calzone. I realized that this style of pizza may not be my favorite as I'd like something with a little more crisp, but I know that's not what a neapolitan style pie is about. The jus for the calzone was very tasty, but it did over power the taste of the actual calzone.\n\nService was ok.", "The guys who work here are incredibly rude - told me a pickup would be ready at a certain time. 20 minutes later I'm still sitting and waiting and when I politely call to ask what the deal is, i hear someone cursing at me in the background over the phone, dropping f bombs loudly. When they bring the food out, I say \"tell the guy who cursed at me that that wasn't necessary.\" The dude doesn't say a word, walks back in, brings the rest of the food says \"sorry for the wait\" and leaves. I live down the block so it's a shame to alienate their own neighborhood.\nFood is too good to write them off. I just wish they were nicer people and treated their customers with respect.", "One of the best pizzas I've had in LA! It's a really cute date night spot with a nice ambiance, dim lights, and great music. My boyfriend and I had the caesar salad and BLTA pizza. The caesar salad was good but the anchovies in it was interesting and I think I can do without them next time. The pizza was so delicious! The dough was so fluffy and soft. You can ask for crushed peppers or chili oil. The chili oil comes in a small bottle with a dropper which makes it feel like you're doing a science experiment when putting the oil on your pizza.

I was the only one without a suit on but the staff were extremely friendly so no one should feel ill at ease in casual clothes. It's a great big sunny room on the river. Now dinner prices are a lot higher than breakfast. I took a peek. For 10 bucks at breakfast though I had complimentary beignets to start. I ordered the two eggs any style (poached for me) with hash browns and a choice of the usual meats (I had ham and had three enormous slices you could cut with a fork) and choice of toast. Coffee was extra. This was a far better deal and scene with its wall of red leather booths than IHOP at the same price. If you want to meet someone for breakfast in the loop for business or otherwise get. thee to CHICAGO CUT STEAKHOUSE...they do need to improve their hashbrowns....my only complaint on a bright and sunny breakfast.", "I am writing this review based solely on their breakfast.....I stopped by and had their crabmeat eggs benedict and it seriously was one of the best meals I've eaten. Everything about it was gastronomically perfect. It started out with a small surprise of fresh beignets, still hot from the fryer. The crabmeat eggs benedict is highly, highly recommended. Just the right amount of hollandaise, a perfectly cooked poached egg, some grilled asparagus and tomato, and a nice chunk of hash browns shaped almost like a slice of pie. The menu offered various forms of eggs benedict from Canadian bacon, to citrus smoked salmon to petite filets, so I'll just have to find an excuse to go back.", "What happened to this place?

We got the bone in rib eye, filet mignon with 2 scallops, creamed spinach, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, chocolate peanut butter mousse pie, and vanilla ice cream for dessert.

Good range of choices on a continuum from flank & steak to tripe & tendon so you're likely to find something right for you no matter how adventurous you're feeling.\n\nBut where this pho joint really stands out is the rest of the menu!  Not just pho like the name would imply - they've got a surprisingly diverse menu. 10 pages long?! It'd probably be handy for those occasions when someone in your group is craving pho but others are not.  The clay pot rice and spring rolls are both delicious.  \n\nThe one drawback about having a full menu?  Service isn't nearly as fast as I'd expect pho to be. I usually find pho is an meal I can bang out in 20-30 minutes from ordering to drinking down the last of the broth.

All the brunch portions are HUGE, and the quality is very consistent - fresh and tasty without being overly \"saucy\" or greasy. Even something as simple as a chocolate croissant was very delicious. This place is great for big groups or even groups of 5-6 (they have booths), but could get a bit loud due to the high ceiling and open space. The location is a bit out of the way but seems like enough people still find a reason to head that way and try it out!", "I've been to Cookshop three times now and have enjoyed every experience.  If you are staying at the Highline hotel or other nearby hotel it's perfect for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  The space is open, bright, and airy.  There is a small bar area when you first walk in so you can have a drink while you wait or even eat along the window.  \n\nMy last two visits were for breakfast and I ordered the gingerbread pancakes, 10 grain porridge, and buttermilk biscuit.  The pancakes are spot on when it comes to gingerbread texture and flavor.  The biscuit seemed to be house made and had a perfect crisp on the outer shell and soft, buttery inside.  The 10 grain porridge is locally sourced and organic.  It comes with an almond crumble which is the perfect salty/crunchy addition to a bowl of mush.  Add the locally sourced honey and you have a complete dish!\n\nI'd be happy to eat here again and again.", "Came here for dinner and i must say the dishes we tried have bold flavors.\n\nThey had the best pork chop (I don't think this is part of their regular menu). Pork chop is juicy, spicy, has a nice sear and accompanied with 3 sweet potatos. It's a little too salty and not cheap ($28), but the portion is big and worth the price. If I ate the pork with radicchio, the saltiness is gone.\n\nWe also ordered the ravioli which is very good also. It is buttery, tender and savory. The mushroom is delicious as well. Unfortunately, portion is not filling.\n\nApart from good food, this place has nice ambience though it can be loud. They served three types of breads, one of which is nice, herby and fresh.

If you like your egg fried through and through, you may want to let them know.\n\nThe banchans are also so well made every time I go and they give you plenty when you order for take-out, which in my book is a big plus.\n\nThe ahjuhmahs (ladies who work there) are sweet also and I appreciated that they didn't \"scold\" me for not being able to speak Korean very well.

It's a very small restaurant where you always see the same two workers (perhaps owners? family?) with everything homemade. Since dine-in isn't available right now, I did take out and brought the food home. It was packed well with very generous portions of rice and banchan. Most importantly, the stew and meat was as delicious as ever... I'm very happy it's still possible to get this wonderful food and I hope the restaurant is doing well during these difficult times.", "This place is in a strip mall on Olympic. Their sign is all in Korean, so be prepared to look for red Hangul lettering to track the restaurant down.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Cheonggukjang and the Galbijjim. I personally preferred the Galbijjim because I didn't know there would be mushrooms in the Cheonggukjang and I am a baby who doesn't like mushrooms.....\n\nThe Galbijjim was legitimately really good though! Service was par for the course, and they were happy to give us second and third helpings of banchan.", "This place is mind blowing. When we arrived and I smelled the fermented soybean soup in the air I knew we had chosen the right place. Some have commented that the signs are all in Korean, but this shouldn't be an issue. With a little common sense, you should be able to figure out which business it is..Also, I noticed some people commented that the menus are all in Korean, but when we went the menus were a hybrid with English descriptions of the dishes. Inside it's very small but not claustrophobic, and very clean.\n\nAnyway, about the food: all 3 of us adored what we ordered. The banchan were wonderful. Best kimchi I've ever had; very well nuanced. I ordered the bi bim bop (my favorite). The ingredients were very fresh. The sauce they provided was incredible. Many places just use ordinary Sriracha hot sauce - not here! It was very granular and viscous. Delightfully flavorful and spicy. My buddy and his gf ordered the tofu soup and a beef bbq dish, which they loved.\n\nService was warm and polite. But even if it had been atrocious, I would have still given it 5 stars because the food is just so amazing.", "I've only picked up from here.  I've gotten the kalbi jim, bulgoki, and pork bulgokil...and of course the cheong guk jang.  They give you a lot of ssam (lettuce and veggies) for wrapping when you order meat.  They also give you a small side of cheong guk jang, so no need to get it separately when you order a couple of meat dishes.  Everything including the banchan tastes clean and fresh.

Dishes are never fussy and are presented simply, with honest flavors and purposeful ingredients. Entr\u00e9es might include a dorade with a cracker-crisp sear, served with nutty romesco sauce and green chickpeas.

This tiny little restaurant is a foodie's delight with a warm, inviting, unpretentious ambiance.  The menu changes every night, and the only decision you need to make is what to order to drink.

It was a salty, creamy sensation with an ice cream like texture.\n\nFrom fresh made pastas to chopped cucumber salad seasoned with chive blossoms, course after course delighted and amazed us one by one.  By the end of the dinner I was so overwhelmed with satisfaction I was professing my undying love for the establishment to our server.\n\nDon't think about it for another moment, if you have not yet been, drop everything and call them up to make a reservation.  You will have little chance of getting a table by just walking up, there are probably no more than 10 tables in the entire place and it's always packed!", "This Italian restaurant in a Dupont townhouse serves a fixed-price menu that changes daily and focuses on the simplicity of each dish's ingredients. Five courses of deliciously simple yet inventive food is the reason to go though. Even the breads and pastas are made in-house, but one negative (for me) is that the choices are limited among the courses, making it  challenging for vegetarians and picky eaters. I'd recommend calling in advance for a sneak peak at the menu if you have this issue. One tip: save room for dessert - this is one of those restaurants where the dessert doesn't take a second seat.\n\nThe atmosphere is elegant yet cheery and despite the close proximity of the tables around you, it manages to be intimate in a good way.  It's not exactly library quiet though.  Reservations are needed and you better make them WAY in advance (there are only 35 seats and they fill up quickly!).", "I came to Obelisk for dinner with two friends last week and had a great experience.  I have been wanting to dine here for 15+ years and finally made it happen.  We thoroughly enjoyed the 5 course menu handwritten each day by the staff.  \n\nThe restaurant is situated in a row home in Dupont Circle - it is simply appointed, but the food is really the focus at this place.  The service was great - they didn't rush us and were very friendly.  \n\nSo, let's talk about the food.  We enjoyed the antipasti to start and the croquettes were the shining star among our group.  We didn't indulge too much in this course as we knew we needed to pace ourselves.  I tried the duck raviolini for my next course and ate every last bite of it - so delicious!  Next up was the culotte with spinach and onions that was dressed with an amazing balsamic (ridiculously good and certainly crave worthy!).  The cheese course came out next and all of the cheese was great, but I couldn't get enough of the taleggio - so tasty!  To finish off the meal, I enjoyed the pineapple essence with banana ice cream dessert...light and the perfect end to a culinary delight of a meal!\n\nIf you haven't been, Obelisk is worth the visit - you will NOT be disappointed!", "I have heard great things about Obelisk for years, and have wanted to try it but felt a little intimidated by the daily prix menu, if it would appeal to dinner companions who didn't like seafood, for instance. My boyfriend and I went on a Friday evening, sat at the two top by the large window, which had a great view from the second story of the passing parade below. From the several antipasti dishes that were chef's choice, to the delectable dessert course, everything was fresh, beautifully seasoned and prepared. I had red snapper filet, served with squash blossoms and a scattering of small clams. Boyfriend had deliciously seasoned grilled lamb chops that could have been cooked a tad longer for our taste. First course choice of porcini raviolii with sage butter sauce was sublime.\n\nThis is the place to go if you want to try the best from the kitchen with many delightful surprises to sample. They make their own butter and pasta. This is a wonderful place to savor the many flavors in a cozy setting with excellent service in a leisurely fashion. We spent two hours enjoying our meal and it was well paced.", "First thing's first: if I weren't sick to the point where I couldn't smell or taste, I'm 98.153% sure I would have given Obelisk five stars.  I'll update this when I return with full sensory perception.\n\nObelisk offers a five-course prix fixe for 65$.  Hailing from Manhattan, this is an incredible steal, especially considering the freshness and quality.  My favorite course (probably due to limited stomach space) was the first: soft, velvety goat cheese slightly reminiscent of good buffalo mozzarella, fried cous cous, tomato gelatin, crab cakes...  It was pretty much a meal in itself.  I also adored my next course: a creamy mushroom soup with so much flavor it punched through my congestion.  I didn't eat much of my venison, cheese plate, or dessert, but my dining party ensured me everything was magnefique!\n\nService was impeccably friendly and well-trained.  I can't wait to come back and write a full-on review.  This place has the potential to break into my top five meals...   Ooohhh.", "We went here for an anniversary and it turned out to be a great decision.  Our expectations were exceeded.\n\nMy date and I each ordered the Sea bass as the main course and were very happy with how it came out.  It was a generous portion very nicely cooked, with toppings on the side.\n\nIn my opinion the main course is really more of the \"grand finale\" of the meal and, when I go back, the items I will most look forward to will be the assortment of interesting appetizers that get served to you somewhat unexpectedly.  On our particular night we were served (among other things) a pork dish, lobster croquettes, baby arugula and spinach salad and grilled octopus.  Each dish was delicious.

At the suggestion of one of my Mexican colleagues, I decided to check out De Colores in Pilsen.  \n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa were quite exceptional.  I rarely took note of salsa, but this had a creamy component that made it jump out.  Very refreshing and unexpected.  The queso fundido was rich and flavorful - another great appetizer.  The white hominy pozole was a umami-bomb!  The savory broth made this a perfect Sunday brunch item!  The carene asada with chimichurri sauce was perfectly executed.  The steak was tender and flavorful, and the chimichurri was classic and packed a punch.  The house salad that came with the steak was forgettable and largely unnecessary.  We decided to overkill with dessert and coffee.  We got the tres-leche cake, which was textbook - moist and delicious.  The coffee, which was infused with cinnamon, was aromatic, full-bodied, yet smooth.  \n\nService was friendly and adequate.  Decor, on the other hand, was a bit quirky. There was Dia de los Muertos decorations all over the bar, and the paintings on the wall were all mugshots of prison inmates.  \n\nAll in all, De Colores offers well-prepared, authentic Mexican food.  I will  be back to try its mole, which is supposed to be a signature of the restaurant.", "I'm always skeptical of Meixcan food that costs more than a few bucks, as the homey authenticity of the cuisine is too easily fancified out of recognition. Occasionally, however, a gussied-up Mexican joint will deliver, and DeCOLORES is one of these rare gems. Guacamole ($6.95) is clearly made fresh in the back, and has a nice chunky consistency; we asked for it spicy, and considering our obvious gringo-ness, the restaurant was surprisingly happy to oblige. The star of the show, however, is the mole poblano ($14.50). The server advertised it as Pilsen's best, and he may well be right (although Yolo in Skokie still reigns supreme); the sauce has a rich chocolatey/nutty flavor with only a touch of sweetness, and is very well balanced by the fire of dry chiles. Tres leches cake ($7) is from Kristoffer's across the street, which is the best in the city, hands down.\n\nPricing is a tad steep, but the quality of everything is very high, so I didn't feel fleeced. Service is very warm and welcoming. If you're looking for a pleasant, classy (if pricier) alternative to the taquerias that flood 18th street, this is an excellent option!", "Went to De Colores this weekend and I must say that their art and movie wallpapers on the wall give this cozy restaurant a nice touch.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience, I ordered the enchiladas with mole and the portion was very generous it came with rice and beans, the taste of the good was ok, unfortunately nothing special or unique, but nothing to complain about.\n\nI had their mango margarita and also not bad but the taste could have been better given that fact that nowadays many restaurants and mainly Mexican restaurants have very creative and fresh margaritas on their menus. The service was good. Overall good experience but nothing special.", "I came here with family for my grandfathers birthday. We chose it because there was a huge range of vegan options (my aunt is vegan so that's always a necessity when we try a new place). The drinks were strong but tasted great. The food was amazing, the vegan ceviche is AWESOME! However, the service we received was subpar. The dining room is rather small and it looked like there was about 3 servers. The food came out in a reasonable time, it was the service in between that was awful. I'm a server myself so I understand how hard it is to get to every table when your busy. However, our server   seemed to be blatantly ignoring us. We were polite to her. But our drinks sat empty for 10+ minutes, she missed out on another round of margaritas from us because by the time she finally came back around we were done eating and just ready for the check... which took another 10-15 minutes. With such a small work area it should be easier to be more attentive and there was obviously a lack of teamwork because none of the other servers stopped by when we were obviously looking around for our server. This place has potential to be amazing, the food is great but the service and teamwork from staff needs to be worked on.", "We live nearby and have been going for nearly two years now. Service is friendly and efficient, even when it's a bit more crowded. We're primarily vegetarian, and the menu has always been very appealing for us with solid, non-standard Mexican veg options that the kitchen seems to put as much effort in as the meat dishes. Very much appreciated! But in the past couple weeks, they've even expanded on this veg portion of the menu to include some Impossible Meat chorizo tacos, which had a number of delicate and layered flavors. I usually order an off-menu mezcal drink that always hits the spot. We're thankful to have such consistently great food nearby. It might be possible that we actually hadn't ordered the guacamole until last time, but it melted our flipping brains, it was so good.", "Try the mole, it's some of the best I've had.

We asked the locals what was best and ended up with most of the daily specials - spanish mackerel, fresh crab roll, black seaweed salad with homemade tofu. Everything was fab. It's amazing how the scariest looking piece of fish can taste like butter when prepped by a pro. He even cooked our mackerel bones after we finished and turned them into a crispy snack.

Very obviously a mom and pop operation, there is limited seating, so if you are trying to dine in with a larger group maybe look elsewhere (Toro nearby is also very good and has a buzzy atmosphere friendly to dining in, along with a large outdoor seating area).

Bento came with the main portion (pork katsu in my case), miso soup, small house salad, two pieces each of tuna roll, cucumber roll, and spicy tuna roll. The udon broth was light and flavorful.\n\nWe also decided to splurge and ordered the blue fin tune sashimi. For $16, we enjoyed a plate of meaty tuna goodness, I think it was six pieces on the plate.\n\nIf I lived in Carmel, I would be tempted to eat here daily. It's a small restaurant but has a well rounded selection of dishes and a large specials board, offering the freshest fish of the day.", "This is a very small restaurant, so I would imagine a long wait if its busy, they have three tables and one table that is nestled in front of the window along with a few seats at the sushi bar.  There was only waiter, which was unfortunate because we were not able to get a hold of him when we needed more tea.  As for the food, we decided to order a bunch of nigiri, which was very yummie.  The quality of fish is superb, yet we found that the pieces were quite smaller than any other sushi restaurant.  Not too sure if the kitchen food is good because we only ordered the fried calamari, which was not too great but would come back again for the fresh fish =)", "Akaoni was a true disappointment for my husband and me. When we entered the restaurant it seemed authentic enough, but in the end we were denied an authentic sushi experience. When we asked the chef for \"omakase\" (essentially, \"chef's choice\" of the freshest cuts), we were told in a not-so-polite fashion that we could only receive such if accompanied by a regular customer. We found this offensive and, quite frankly, suggestive of the chef's incompetence. For those who are looking to sit at the counter and enjoy the unique exhilaration of the freshest and most adventurous sushi, not to mention the pleasure of conversing with the chef who's preparing it for you, Akaoni will most likely disappoint.", "Delectable, fresh-tasting fish. Cozy, calming, relaxing atmosphere with a serious Chef at work in this tiny little restaurant. (I could have done without the fairly loud airing out of dirty laundry by fellow diners -- but I suppose this comes standard with every meal in Carmel. I couldn't fit a word in sideways into my own conversation because we would have had to shout over our neighbors' discussions of medication cocktails and the unfairness of specific divorce settlements so both of us just gave up and focused on the food.)\n\nFellow obnoxious patrons notwithstanding, our dinner was absolute perfection on a Friday night. This place beat out my go-to sushi spot in the Bay Area by a significant margin with the quality of every item that we had last night, from miso to tempura to two kinds of sashimi and the perfect rainbow roll.\n\nThose complaining about perceived rudeness of staff: perhaps consider examining your biases and the kind of cultural exposure you have had in your life, if your take on the operations of this restaurant boils down to statements about rudeness. Service is as efficient and as attentive as it needs to be.\n\nWe will be back and bring others.", "I am a regular here. Have not been to Carmel for a little while and right now they do take out. Since they were not open for dining we had gone to a different sushi restaurant in Monterey earlier in the week. It was rated 4.7, and was terrible. On the other hand, I am shocked that Akioni only gets something like a 3.7 or 3.8 rating. This is definitely the best sushi restaurant in the Carmel area. Very fresh and consistent - amazing. Extremely small. I think people are put off sometimes by how small it is and maybe the prices, which are high.

The Tokyo Gangster was also a treat. The El Scorcho, however, had us both reaching for our water and sweating after each bite.

The ambiance, the food, the service, all combined into an extremely lively and upbeat feel to a small, homely setting makes for the most perfect and memorable Valentine's Day dinner for my boyfriend Ahmed and I. We were treated so kindly from the very beginning. I've been wanting to try this place out for over a year and we've finally came on a special night. The watermelon salad, Lamb kebabs and pistachio pudding are all a must. Along with some Lebanese beer and I was one happy lady. The son of the owner, who TRULY is the definition of class, was one of the most nicest people I've ever met. He was MADE to do what he does. He made me feel a part of their family. He made everyone feel like we were a huge family, all together that night. Very special evening made perfect thanks to the entire staff during my time there this past Valentine's Day. Ahmed and I will make this place a tradition\n\nYou guys are great. Keep doing what you do!", "Great food, intimate ambiance, and good service.\n\nFood:\n- We ordered the mezze sampler platter to share between a group of 5. Good variety of spreads and salads and a good size for our group. I loved the hummus and this red pepper cheese dip! Outstanding. The cucumbers and tomato's were refreshing too. Would definitely recommend. It comes with pita but we had to order another basket of pita to finish the plate (extra pita is extra).\n- I ordered the sole. It was buttery and lightly fried. Delicious! Also came with a side of rice and spinach. It was a good portion and I enjoyed the dish.\n- A friend got the pasta with the lamb sausage and it was incredible. Tasted super flavorful and cheesy, and had a good amount of meat and veggies in it, with the thick tagliatelle pasta.\n- my other friends got the salmon and lamb kabobs. I didn't get a chance to try them but they both said they were amazing, flavorful, and juicy. It was a good sized plate of food too.\n\nPrices:\n- Dishes were around $20-30. A bit more expensive than what I'm used to paying but I think the standard for Carmel.", "My friend and I did the coastal drive from LA to SF and spent a night in Carmel, but we neglected to make any dinner reservations for our stay. We left our name with the hostess at another restaurant offering Mediterranean fare, but after an hour went by and there appeared to be no hope of getting a table, I called Yafa and asked if we could be seated right away. The gentleman on the phone (I believe he was the owner) said very warmly that we were welcome and there would be no delay in getting a table. Carmel reminds me of some magical town that was built by fairies and elves, and dining at Yafa proved to be just as magical. The staff were so friendly and attentive, the subdued lighting, jovial atmosphere, windows open to the cool night air, and outstanding food added up to a very special dinner. From the complementary sundried tomato and feta dip, to the pear salad, the sumptuously seasoned kafta platter, and the pistachio-rose-water pudding -- oh yeah, I definitely gorged that night! -- all the dishes ticked off my deliciousness boxes. I wish Yafa all the best success for many years to come.", "I have never personally witnessed restauranteurs as happy and dedicated to their craft as the guys at Yafa. We were greeted with big smiles at the door and sent home with hugs. We dined here on Valentine's Day and they gave every woman in the place a red rose. They also broke into boisterous song in the middle of dinner and encouraged people to dance, which made me feel almost transported to an exotic part of the world.\n\nAs far as food goes, skip the mishmish chicken ($17.95) and opt instead for the Aleppo kefta platter ($18.95). The platter comes with juicy, well-seasoned ground beef and lamb kebab, cool, creamy yogurt sauce, fluffy rice and tangy tabouli salad and is simply stellar. Just writing about it makes me crave it!\n\nWhen in Carmel, Yafa's a great pick.", "Small place with a warm and welcoming ambience. Live music throughout the night.\n\nAppetizer - mixed hummus plate with pita bread - nothing particularly special, but very tasty.\n\nEntree - Yafa pasta. Absolutely delicious but very rich - the portion size doesn't look huge but it will fill you up. Girlfriend got the chicken skewer, which was some of the best marinated chicken I've ever had.\n\nDessert - pistachio pudding. Light and creamy, perfect dessert.\n\nOverall would highly recommend this place and definitely plan on coming back if I'm ever in the area!", "My wife and I stopped in here on Memorial Day weekend for a nice dinner.  Foolishly we had not made any reservations and even though the owner said they were all booked up he spoke with the staff and found us a table anyways.  How lucky we were; the food was delicious and the staff was warm and friendly.  It was clear many customers entering the restaurant were regulars since they were greeted by name with smiles and big hugs.  Towards the end of our meal we were delightedly surprised when one of the staff members began playing percussion and singing a song in Greek while more staff members plucked some diners to for some dancing.  The atmosphere was lovely and our food was wonderful; I would highly recommend Yafa to any tourist visiting Carmel (just make sure to make a reservation!).", "Excellent food all around and gluten free options as well. Amongst us we had the salmon, eggplant and chicken dishes as well as pear salad and octopus.

It's a one man show which makes it feel extra special. He is the one chef that works there and he determines the menu. It is great watching him do his thing. The chef was quiet but enjoyed sharing his cooking techniques and ingredients.\n\nMy favorite was the Pike Mackerel nigiri followed by the eggplant nigiri. Both had a deep rounded full flavor. Like Delage they also like pairing shiso leaf with sea bream and other similar white fish. A few times the chef breaks out the blowtorch to add a delicious smoky flavor to the fish.\n\nThe wasabi is grated fresh in front of you, and instead of sliced pickled ginger, they use cubes of pickled young ginger which I found refreshing crunchy.\n\nThe rice was a standout- using a special vinegar that makes it brown.

Return the love.\n\nThe delicious food is very similar in content and presentation to Delage, but in a much more convivial and cozy environment.

I was not disappointed. If you are a true sushi lover, not the fat rolls with funny names type of sushi lover, then this place is a must. It's not just the food, it's the whole experience as well.

The baklava was some of the best I've ever had (they make it in-house), I even saved some of it just so I would have some for later. The turkish sweet (I forget the name) that I got was like an almond nougat covered in pistachio powder.

I had the Adana kebab, turkish tea, and pistachio baklava to finish off the meal. Everything was so good! It was all extremely flavorful and there was not one thing on my plate that I didn't absolutely love! In general, I'm not a huge fan of hummus. I never understood the hype in spreading hummus on everything like some people do. However after trying the hummus here, I've been craving it on ON EVERYTHING. I get why people love hummus now. The tea was light and perfect on a chilly SF day. The baklava was on the sweeter side but still had the perfect balance of crunch from the flaky exterior plus pistachios and soft doughy pillowness that you'd want in a pastry.

We also each had one of their wraps which were super good as well. I think one of the biggest surprises is their Turkish pastries. We had the baklava which was possibly the best baklava that I've ever had and they have this gorgeous case of beautifully made pastries that have clearly been made with extreme care. Chocolate and pistachio, rose petal, hazelnut with lemon and coconut....very unique and a testament to the care that is clearly put into the restaurant. Also super friendly.", "4.5 Stars...

My $16 cucumber mojito tasted like water, however my waiter was kind enough to switch it out (although it took 15 minutes to do so). Service in general was slow and often times non-existent. The highlight of my night was the ice cream I got across the street at Soft Swerve. $100 later (for two people) I left this restaurant hungry. The prices just aren't justified. I would much rather go to a non- vegetarian restaurant with larger portions and a better ambiance and simply order the vegetarian options.", "Not as filling as expected, so ended up loading up on the curry fries and the Broccoli (which features a hot dog like bun).  Great presentation and definitely fun to see how diverse vegetarian/vegan cuisine can be.  Favorites included the Tomato (tart) and Radish (noodle), however Potato (noodle) was a bit too raw.

Even the open-floor design, with windows aplenty and oyster-tinted walls, is fresh and inviting.\nThanks to the use of top-shelf ingredients and a wood-burning oven, this is a menu of seasonal marvels. Squash soup with toasted pumpkin seeds is comfort in a bowl, as are veal polpettine with robiolina cheese and tomato sauce. Pastas and pizzas are impossible to resist.

It is so hard to find good pasta in Westchester that isn't penne alla vodka at a local diner, and because of that -- I am so grateful for Burrata.\n\nMy family frequents Burrata often, and we have our order down. We usually start off with the burrata salad and crema di burrata (we love burrata, if you can't tell). My sister loves their agnolotti (short rib filled pasta that comes with balsamic), my father usually gets their prosciutto pizza, and I love their simple spaghetti (tomato, basil, and garlic).\n\nThe golden wood-burning pizza oven is super cozy and they play great music. It's one of the few places that I'd be equally comfortable going to for a family get-together or a nice date.\n\nThe seats near the entrance get really cold during the winter, but other than that -- it's a perfect spot.", "You can't swing a dead cat in Eastchester without hitting a pizza joint....but a great one?....Burrata hits the bullseye.  Delicious, delicious delicious! And spacious with a beautiful bar.  This place replaces the old Martinis and Chocolates which actually was not bad... but never really caught on for some reason.  Perhaps that name?\nAnyway...I've been here two times and can tell you that the pizza is absolutely divine. But pizza shmizza it's not all about pizza right?\n\nThey have a gorgeous centerpiece tiled pizza oven that turns out thin crust pizzas of several different creative flavors..so delicious.

They also have a great contorni (vegetable) section on the menu that we had  that was so fabulous I want to go back and just order those with some wine.\nService was eager to please and not obtrusive.\n\nThe restaurant is comfortable...and what more can one ask for really, but to sit and enjoy a delicious meal in lovely surroundings with pleasant service after all?\nI hope they do very well.", "My fianc\u00e9 and I held our engagement party at Burrata on a Sunday afternoon. We had the entire restaurant to ourselves, and Mike helped us to create a custom menu. From beginning to end, we had a wonderful experience. Mike was very flexible with the menu, willing to accomodate special dietary requests for some of our guests and allowed us to bring in our own decorations, favors, etc.\n\nOn the day of our event, the whole staff worked hard to make sure all of our guests were taken care of. The food was amazing and the portions were plentiful. The staff made 50+ pizzas in a half hour! All of our guests were blown away by the food (especially the burrata cheese and the nutella pizzas for dessert!). As for drinks, we offered unlimited wine and beer, and our glasses were always full. Many were impressed by the specialty beer offerings as well!\n\nOur event was truly one of a kind thanks to Burrata's delicious food and great service. Our friends and family have not stopped raving about how impressed they were (and we are a big Italian family who can be very hard to please!) and many have told us that they will be returning to Burrata in the future.

We went in on a whim last night on the early side for dinner.  The waitstaff was so professional and on their game.  It wasn't really busy yet but each person was doing their job perfectly, waitress was great, manager(?), busser, and the chef making pizzas were all working, no one was slacking off which I appreciated.  We ordered the Burrata with crostini for an appetizer and it was SO GOOD.  Creamy burrata on toasted bread?! Oh my god, delicious.  We also got the prosciutto pizza with smoked mozz, balsamic onions, and arugula.  Amazing.  The hearth just produces pizzas that are so tasty, little burned bubbles on the crust?! YUM.  And the inside was great.  The hearth is a gorgeous centerpiece but the fixtures and everything created a great ambiance.  We will definitely be back again.

This makes the perfect excuse to over-order and try a little bit of everything! All of the dishes were delicious, but the Nasu Nibitashi (eggplant) and Kara-Age (fired chicken) really stood out. I'm not usually one to rave about meatless dishes, but the eggplant was nothing short of amazing. I could potentially eat an entire plate of that and leave happy.\n\nThe other thing to note here is their fantastic sake collection. They have a great list of sake and are eager to recommend potential pairings for your dishes. I was blown away by the sweet sake they paired with our dessert. Sadly at that point of the night I'd enjoyed a few too many glasses so I can't remember the name, but I don't think I've ever been as pleased with a dessert/wine pairing.

The tartare was served with chips and was delicious. My gf didn't care much for the kimchi (not a tomato fan), but it was still good!\n\nCourse 2: Buta Shumai and Soriresu. Three pieces of shumai filled with bacon bits. Pretty good. The Soriresu (chicken oysters + yuzu kosho yakitori) was delicious! Perfectly cooked and tasted heavenly.\n\nCourse 3: Buta Shogayaki and Kamo Seira Soba. The shogayaki (ginger pork belly slices) was the star of the night. The cook of the meats and the sauce was delicious. The soba (noodles + duck broth) was meh, but it's probably because we were super full by then.\n\nCourse 4: Haji-cha Soft Serve. I'm not a fan of soft serve but damn was this good.

There is valet parking -very useful because the neighborhood is very crowded and street parking is difficult to find. We enjoyed the special sashimi of the day as well as the yellowtail sashimi. Very fresh and tasty. The chicken karaage is marinated chicken pieces deep fried with a light crispy crust. Also had the grilled steak dish which is a small portion of perfectly cooked medium rare steak slices. The mushrooms cooked in a nice broth was also light and very flavorful. Had a shrimp tempura dish that was tasty but not the best i've ever had. The ice cream dessert was ice cream layered with coffee gelatin squares and corn flakes.  It was tasty and light, but i'm not a huge fan of breakfast cereal in my dessert (maybe at home, but not when I'm paying for a pricey dessert).  Overall, excellent dinner with a sophisticated preparation of simple traditional Japanese dishes. If it weren't a trek for me, I'd probably come again. If you live in the area, this is a great neighborhood restaurant.

The restaurant is rather small, but seems to be able to kept everyone served immediately and with a full house, that was a good sign.  Everything started with free beer or sake, which is not a bad thing.  The food is like an Izakaya or smaller servings for bar food, so you will be ordering several tapas style dishes.  The flavors of the food are remarkable, with hints of special soy and hearty beef stew flavors that goes well with rice.

It comes with a coconut curry kind of dipping sauce. So addicting!\n\nI've had a couple of noodle dishes here, the Mie Goreng Indo (yes, like the instant noodle!) which are fried noodles and the Mie Hakka, which is more like a dry noodle. Both come with various toppings such as chopped BBQ pork, fish cakes, fish balls, fried onions and more. And both are delicious, depending on your preference.

Seriously this stuff is legit AND cheap. We had the laska mee, the Singaporean fried rice, the roti, and the chicken satay. The laska mee was delicious. Essentially Singaporean ramen style noodles in a deeply flavorful lemongrass broth with shrimp, fish cake, and fish ball. Hard to find laska in LA. The only other place I know that has it is Cassia in Santa Monica at 3 x the price. The Singaporean fried rice was very good as well. It was flavored with a mildly sweet soy sauce, pork, fish cake, shrimp, sausage. Super savory and filling. The chicken satay was the most flavorful I've ever had (usually that stuff relies on the peanut sauce for flavor, this did not). The roti was good but not life changing.

In an area known for their wide variety of Asian food, I don't know of very many Bornean restaurants. If you want a means of comparison, Borneo is a mixture of Malaysian and Indonesian food. It's a tiny hole in the wall tucked away right off of Main Street. There's a parking structure behind it so access is not an issue.\n\nOnce inside, you'll see that it's not a huge restaurant.

I opted for a laksa noodle curry soup which had great noodle texture and a flavorful broth as well. Out of the noodles I tried there, i'd recommend the Hakka and Hokian style of noodles over the indo type. They have a nicer chewiness and the right amount of elasticity to complement the soup.

It has shrimp, fish cake, fried tofu, marinated egg, beansprouts, topped with sliced fried shallots, scallions, and sweet corn, in a mild spicy curry coconut milk soup. Sooooo good!! The Rojak was overall ok.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any of the sauce(s) (not sure if you have to explicitly ask for bbq sauce or if it was overlooked?), but the sides were very nice. The collard greens were cooked to a perfect texture with the ribs meticulously removed, and the pit beans were hearty and slightly smoky. The granny's potatoes are extremely rich with a ton of cheese, sour cream (I think?), etc., which is not my favorite style of potato (we didn't ask how they were prepared), but they were extremely popular and the scallions cut through the richness nicely.\n\nI definitely look forward to coming to Horn's again :)", "Horn's is fantastic. Though I'll warn you, get there early or expect to stand in line. They do pre-orders but this requires you to purchase a minimum of 2lbs per meat. Instead we wanted to get a variety of meats, so we got there at 10:30am and waited till they opened at 11. We were probably 4th in line and by 10:50 there was a long line down the block. You'll probably get the goods if you come a little later but don't wait too long.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best BBQ places in the Bay Area. We had high expectations of the brisket and while it was good, the ribs was what really blew our minds. The chicken was also delicious; extremely smokey, juicy and well flavored throughout. I'm not a fan of spicy food so I'd probably skip the Hot Links next time.\n\nOn a nice day out, Horn has a great, large outdoor space to indulge on your meats. On a rainy day, not so much, since it's not covered and you don't want your BBQ to get wet and cold. Can't wait to be back, Horn BBQ is definitely worth the trek to West Oakland..", "I'm so happy and thankful that they are still doing pre-orders, as we had planned for Mother's Day.

So we had leftovers, and they were still just as good!\n\nWe got the brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, hot link, granny's potatoes, potato salad, mac n cheese, and banana pudding. I don't think things were salty as some mentioned before. I did think perhaps peppery, but it was fine.

One small greens (which had no meat but i'm not sure if they're vegetarian but they're not great tasting) and some potatoes we were told were Mac n cheese. Such a small amount of food was $50.

The hot link was spicer than expected, but we are thinking will wait for it to cool and slice it up with some cheese.

I heart!", "Grand Omakase is certainly the legit way to open up this great Japanese gem, as one gets to experience the carefully made sushi pieces, but also have an opportunity to try some of the kitchen made dishes. Michelin one star for the past two years, yet was taken away the star this year, unfortunately.\n\nPlus: all their uni was from Hokkaido (I personally did not like Uni from the west coast - it was big in size yet less flavorful), so made it a great combo with either the scallop or the vinegar rice itself. Also, the wagyu beef was seared just to the right level of tenderness, and carried a little smooth texture on top, very unique taste!\n\nMinus: the cooked sweet fish was a bit bitter that I did not find myself quite fond of.\n\nThis is my first Kaiseki in the west coast and pros certainly overweighted cons.

There are two menu options: petit omakase ($98 for 8 courses) or omakase ($168 for 11). The biggest difference is the wagyu dish. We chose the omakase. While there are technically 11 courses, some come with multiple pieces of sushi or bites of food. Overall, I was very happy with the quality and preparation of food. It is comparable to some of the best places I've been in NYC. My only complaint is that for $168, it should have included dessert. We got the yuzu shiso leaf sorbet which was light and refreshing but feel it should have been included. My husband's favorite course was the wagyu; mine was the scallop", "My dining companion and I came to Kusakabe  for dinner.  We called to say we were running 10 minutes late and the hostess was very understanding and thanked us for calling and told us not to worry.  We were seated at the sushi bar in Chef Nori's section.  What a treat.\n\nThe sushi is absolutely fresh and wonderful.  I loved his technique of smoking fish.  He placed the sliced fish on a cherry board and used a torch to burn the surrounding wood which gave the fish a slight hint of smokiness.  Delish!\n\nWe did the grand Omakase tasting menu with the sake pairing.  It was very good.  The portions were not enough so we ordered a few more items.  The wagyu beef was so good we got seconds of that.  He also had 3 types of uni that night: regular uni from Hokkaido, short spine uni from Hokkaido, and regular uni from Santa Barbara.  We got to do a side-by-side taste test.  We loved the two from Hokkaido the best.\n\nI would go back in a heart beat...after I break the piggy bank.", "I had such a lovely time here. The food was delicious and each course was so interesting in their choice of preparation. I really appreciated their ambition; I feel like there's usually an expectation in terms of taste and quality when people go for omakase, but I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors and textures they incorporated. It was fun! I absolutely loved the Hokkaido uni and hotate from their nigiri sets; it was SO buttery and soft and sweet. If I could have that every single day, I would. They also had a spicy mentaiko omelette in their cooked dish course that I could not stop thinking about! It was so, so good.\n\nThe service was also very, very attentive and kind. They even gave me a cute little jar of buckwheat tea (Hokkaido Dattan Sobacha) since it was a birthday dinner! The restaurant was clean (heated toilets, yes!) and the ambiance was so nice and intimate. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone seeking to a wonderful sushi/kaiseki-style dining experience.

There's plenty of reviews discussing what the pros are, but my main gripe is that it's inconsistent. The very first time I came to DomoDomo was with a group and the nigiri had small amounts of wasabi that was so strong, we all reeled and saw stars. This coming from regular sushi eaters who are not new to eating wasabi. The next time I came, I tasted almost no wasabi at all, even though I had prepared for it. Either it was a different sushi chef or different wasabi batch, but either way, significantly different taste each time to my nigiri. Additionally, the fish from my first visit was a bit more firm while my second visit has much more tender and melt-in-your-mouth texture. I also noticed a variation in how much I could taste the flavor of the fish between visits (ignoring the wasabi situation). One last note is that some of the nigiri pieces were a bit \"modernized\" with a small dab of something to make it taste a little interesting, so purists might not enjoy as much.

As for the hand rolls, the seaweed was nice and crisp and there's that sound as you bite into it :) Except the lobster hand roll, because of the mayo/butter, the seaweed got soft.\n\nExtra things we got:\n- fried oyster hand roll - crunchy fried oyster, with some microgreens.

Another gem in the city! I made the reservation one week ahead of time for a Saturday night for part of two.\n\nGreat quality of sushi and the best hand rolls I had so far (super crispy skin). Private ambiance with good background music. Staff is extremely friendly and considerate. My tea cup is always filled with hot tea, and staff kept checking with us for feedback and if we need anything else. They have several choices of courses to choose from. We opted for the $50 two oysters, salad appetizer and 7 pieces of sushi and hand roll set. I enjoyed every single dish of the whole meal. Arugula apple shrimp salad opened up my appetite with the fruit sweet and sourness and the vinegar dressing. Hand rolls are a must mention. Best thing of eating at the sushi bar is that we can eat everything right after made, so fresh at the right temperature. The seawe as coat is so crispy and goes really well with rice.\n\nAfter we finished the whole meal, my friend and I spent 20more minutes finishing up the remaining sake and our talk.

It's either cheap sushi or high prices for good to excellent sushi. Domodomo is a nice restaurant that provides hand rolls.

I opted to eat 4 hand rolls while my sister wanted to go from the \"domosake\", which is their highest priced tasting menu. My sister loved the appetizers and king salmon sushi the best.

Best to come with someone to share the dishes (4+ is ideal). Super reasonable prices for what you get.\n\nBest dish:\nSpicy fish with flaming chili oil - really tender fish swimming in chili oil. The oil looks intimidating at first but once you bite into the fish, the tingling feeling of your tongue combined with the deliciousness of the fish will win you over.\n\nSolid:\nHot and sour soup - the flavor is right on. Not as exquisite as hakkasan but it's also 8x cheaper! Best to share with 4+ people even with the medium size.\n\nSpicy beef tendon - super large portion. I could barely make a dent on this.\n\nGiven that this place is known for spicy food, it's tempting to order all things spicy - which may give you a bit of heartburn if you are used to it. Recommend to mix it up a bit.

Um yeah. Just order it. No questions.\n2) ***Fried chicken with chili peppers. Comes on a gigantic plate. Not too much chicken, though.\n3) ***Ma Po Tofu: Standard Ma Po\n4) ****Fish in boiled spicy sauce: Standard \"shui zhu yu\"...fish filet pieces in spicy broth\n5) *Dan Dan Noodles: Wasn't all that tasty this time around\n6) *Wontons in spicy sauce: Eh.\n7) ****Eggplant in spicy sauce: I love how this eggplant is.

My grilled country ham was delicious, severed with some type of beautifully prepared greens, pears, pumpkin spaetzel and pork jus.  \n\nAn exceptional wine and cocktail list, including the best standard margarita ever.

The seared scallops were amazing and buttery soft with just the right amount of seared crust, and the mini crab cake balls were as good as crab cakes get - being fried balls of crab, there's generally not too much subtlety involved in their execution, but they were very well done. The rack of lamb with a side of lamb bacon bits over assorted vegetables was also delicious, and who can say no to creamy, gooey burrata? The strawberry rhubarb pie was also very good - tart and not too sweet, complemented by a nice vanilla bean ice cream that was also not too sweet (in a good way), but at that point I was sadly too stuffed to finish it. The service was also really good. Great place to go on an expense account!", "As soon as you walk in, you get the sense of quaint, classic and elegant.\nOkay, I must admit, they had me once I saw the beautiful china on the tables.

When I last dined here, I was blown away by the pan-seared scallops, which were as succulent as any I've tasted. On this visit, though, I opted for the NY Strip, which I though was somewhat dry and unimpressive. The Gnocchi appetizer, however, was simply wonderful and the wine selections divine, so I suppose I'll have to visit again and give this fabulous restaurant a chance to regain it's five-star status.\n\nIf you're looking for a memorable, romantic spot to dine in Washington, the 1789 Restaurant should be at the top of your list.

It's better in the summer. And this is coming from someone who melts like the Wicked Witch of the West in DC heat.

We started with the pastry basket and got a few different dishes to share, and finished off with some donuts for dessert. The pastry basket and ricotta pancakes were my favorite. The brunch is not as traditional as some other spots - there is no plain scrambled eggs option or something simple, but that is to be expected. Everything has a unique touch and lots of great seafood. Just be sure to check the menu before you head over for brunch so you aren't expecting eggs and toast but then are surprised by innovative dishes. I would definitely recommend for a special occasion or if the weather is nice and you can snag a spot outside. I have zero complaints, even the coffee was freshly brewed and perfect, which I usually find is not the case when I go to brunch. Be sure to check out the prices since you will spend more than a usual brunch (or dinner I would assume), but you get the ambiance, service, quality, and view of the waterfront.", "It feels like you might be in Florence . The lighting was perfect and the view of the Potomac was beautiful. In a word \"elegant\"................romantic and intimate come to mind as well.\n\nWe shared everything. The Japanese Hamachi Tartare was presented as well asit tasted and the Sicilian Garden Salad was fresh and wonderful. The salad made a great way to clean the palate for the next course. We had the lobster ravioli and the grilled Branzino. The lobster ravioli was incredible and the sauce delicate and the essence of lobster. The 2012 Merry Edwards Sauvignon Blanc paired nicely with the Hamachi and the main courses. Desert was Gelato with warm doughnut holes and a maple dipping sauce.\n\nThe service was first class and impeccable. It seemed like we had 4 or 5 gentlemen waiting on us at all times. The best I have ever experienced.\n\nThe valet parking is the way to go here. Street parking would be difficult. The valet service was well done.", "A great place to sample during e.g. the restaurant week when three course lunch menu is $22.\nI had a heirloom tomato salad, excellently spiced with delicious dressing, bronzino on the bed of cooked vegetables and blueberry ice-cream for dessert. Everything was exquisitely cooked and served.  \n\nThe only downside of Fiola Mare, for my age group, is that it's expensive and filled with crowd in their 40s that looks rich, reserved  and serious.  Nevertheless, if you have a good occasion to celebrate and would like to try Italian seafood and pasta dishes it might be a place to consider. Another good occasion to go is the restaurant week, when the place has more patrons in their mid-twenties to mid-thirties age group and feels a bit more casual and less pretentious.", "We were so glad to be able to go back to Fiola Mare after a long pandemic hiatus. We have been there twice since May 2021 and we're absolutely thrilled with everything from A to Z, the welcome, the food, the wine, the service, the ambiance... The Catalan lobster crudo is a gem, the pappardelle is so good that must NOT be shared. Chef Anton does his magic with whole fish. We had Dover sole, simply grilled the first time, and a whole turbot fisherman style the second time, both delicious and satisfying (to coin a phrase)... The wine list is one of the finest we've ever seen. Wine service is understated and excellent. Service in general is professional, informative and friendly... The first time, they even remembered our preferences from before the pandemic. Thanks for everything...", "The view here is incredible so I'll start with that, very romantic ambiance and has an amazing selection of clams! One of my personal favorite places to go to in DC.

We had an order of the capital oysters which was a little different but WOW! Everything we ate here was completely mouth watering, it is a bit on the pricy side but i believe when it comes to an experience you can't put a price on it.

We did everything family style so we could try more things. We started off with a salad and ricotta spread. Both great, salad fresh and crisp and the spread heartier. We also shared a few pasta dishes and a pizza and they were all top notch,  you can't go wrong with any of them. We didn't get to try any of the meat getting roasted in front of us but it looked and smelled like it's something I need to try.  All of the wine on the menu is 40$ so we needed a bit of help with the wine choice but whatever we got was reasonable. Service was good.

The food here is fantastic! And the service is great. We had the pleasure of being waited on by Colette. We asked her to pair wines with our meals and she nailed it! We started with the burrata and the speck. Both were delicious. The hazelnuts and mushrooms complemented the burrata so well. Our mains were the Agnolotti del Plin and the Garganelli. Both were fantastic! The sauces were so flavorful though fantastically light. The rabbit, veal, and pork stuffing in the Agnolotti was soooo good....as my husband said, rabbit is too underutilized at restaurants. Overall a fantastic meal and great service.

I normally love braised octopus but it was kind of mushy.\nThe erbette chard was so strange.  It came in a little bowl with basically boiled chard (not properly drained) topped with cheese.  The undrained water diluted any flavor there might have been.\nThe pork was tasty but seemed too neat and tidy to be an italian dish but maybe that is the point of cotogna.\nService was spotty.  The space was nice but felt cold.\nI would not go back since there are so many great restaurants in SF to try but am glad I checked it out.", "OK I havent tried every italian restaurant in SF but I can confidently say that I was absolutely blown away here.\n\nAmbiance - beautiful rustic modern contemporary decor, exposed brick, copper fixtures, large windows with plenty of natural lighting.

He suggested the strawberry dessert and we also had the poached pear, too elaborate to describe in detail here but my taste buds are happy happy! It is a little pricey but well worth it. Five stars and kudos to the chef!", "This adorable cafe in the Mirabelle inn is a must visit in Solvang. It was on the Michelin 2019 guide and still has great service,food and ambiance. The individual meals are pretty sumptuous and you wouldn't necessarily need to order an appetizer. The duck wings (not pictured ) were a refreshing change from traditional wings. The scallops and the special of the day - salmon were particularly delicious. The scallops being on pasta made it a filling portion. The lamb chops were well done and beautifully plated. The roasted potatoes are a good choice for a side with a delicious dipping sauce. The wine cake was average and would be something we wouldn't revisit. Their wine list is extensive - try the wines from their organic winery. All of them were very good and they also have a tasting room in Los Olivos. Most of the patrons in this restaurant were the hotel guests. They have indoor and well setup outdoor seating. This is one of the finer restaurants in solvang and a must try if you are looking for a fancy dinner out :)", "What an experience! Service was amazing! Great portions for a tasting  menu. Everything is made with such care and precision that every plate is beautiful but invites you to devour every last drop. My husband had the lobster bisque (super creamy with the most amazing crab cake ball things), duck wings (con fit with mouth watering spices) and seared tuna (so tender it feels like velvet and uses the same spices as duck but totally different flavor, still awesome). I had the kimchi cracklings, roasted cauliflower  (perfectly seasoned with the the smoothest cauliflower puree and ingenious quick-fried quinoa) and the cod (OMG truffle puree). We ended the meal with the Milk Chocolate  & Honey dessert.... this was an experience and every meal should be concluded with this dessert!!!!!", "I don't give out 5 stars easily. Especially when it comes to fine dining. I expect excellence and innovation. First and Oak delivers.  The cauliflower appetizer was an amazing pairing with a citrus crema and fruit compote. Wonderful blend of flavor. The duck wings were coated in a perfect glaze, just a bit tart and a bit sweet.  For entrees, the wagyu steak had a smoky flavor which was delicious. The seafood cannelloni had more delicate flavors, but artfully done. My wife really liked the lamb risotto too. I was a little disappointed in the dessert round, not because it tasted bad, but because the there was far too stingy a portion of white chocolate ice cream (about two bites)..I could have done without the meringue on top..just more ice cream.  My wife loved the tiramisu.\nThis is a cozy, romantic place that is great for a date.", "Just had a great dinner. Had the five course tasting menu paired with their own wines. The Crispy kimchi, duck wings, lobster bisque, halibut and tuna was all excellent. Service was great and every course was as good as the service. Will come back for sure.", "F&O was a surprise in a number of ways. We weren't expecting their pre fixe menu when we arrived, but I'm glad we took the plunge and indulged. The food is incredible and inventive across the board and the ambiance is charming and memorable. Who would have thought Solvang would be secreting away this hidden gem?\n\nHighly recommended; this the dining experience against which all others in the area are measured, or should be.", "The menu allows the patron to create their own pairings of flavors from the variety of course offerings.

We shared a Dutch baby and a brunch dish with lamb sausage and polenta (eggs in purgatory). The eggs in purgatory was so good! The portion was a bit small though! I wanted more bread to dip in the sauce and perhaps more sausage to enjoy. It does come with 2 eggs so it was a normal portion lol. The flavor was so yummy! The Dutch baby was perhaps underwhelming. I enjoyed the flavor but was disappointed with the presentation. I thought it'd be in a cast iron! No big deal, but I found the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche was too runny for this dish and it perhaps needed a topping that wasn't runny (soggy Dutch baby is no fun).

The Balkan Experience, all you can eat, is by far the best value. There's a 2 hour time limit and each person can't have more than one alcoholic drink at a time. I highly recommend it for a group experience, but everyone at the table must get the Balkan Experience. I don't think anything on the menu is too wild and you'll definitely eat to your heart's content. I loooooove the fried sourdough bread, particularly dangerous with the nutella topping, but don't fill up on those because you won't be able to eat anything else.\n\nThere's a lot to be said for good wait staff and I think Ambar as a whole has really invested in finding friendly, helpful people. I've never had a negative, or even neutral, experience with the people who work there. They seem genuinely happy to feed you. I am looking forward to going to this location for a dinner experience, especially when the weather is nice and there is outdoor seating. Also note that alcohol is included in the all you can eat option at this DC location but not at the VA location.", "Good food, but a little expensive. They serve both mezze style and regular entrees, and especially if you're going with the latter the bill will add up; however, this is to be expected somewhat when ordering small plates.\n\nThe veal soup and shopska salad are both authentic, and bring back memories of the same dishes I had when in Sarajevo. The cevapi (the Balkan ground beef fingerlings), though not quite like what you'd find at the typical cevapi joint, are very good, and come with well-paired pan-fried red peppers. I would also highly recommend the Balkan burger, which comes with a cucumber/yoghurt topping which adds a nice fresh crunch.\n\nMy main complaint is that the rakija is way overpriced, but what can one expect from a nice restaurant in Barracks Row which is serving an uncommon foreign liquor? It's just painful to pay $8 for a dram or rakija which costs 5 BAM ($3.50) at most bars in Sarajevo.\n\nOverall, very pleased that there is a Balkan restaurant in DC, which serves authentic and delicious food. If you've never had Balkan food before, or even if you have, I'd highly recommend giving this place a try.", "Really enjoyed Ambar, which opened my palate to a new cuisine with a number of hits (and a few misses).\n\nMajor hits included: the leek croquettes, which were nice and crispy well-stuffed with leeks inside; the Balkan Kebab, which were a good balance of grilled char and juicy plumpness; the pork flatbread, a rather clich\u00e9 option that was nonetheless prepared well; the spicy pork sausage in a pea/root vegetable stew.\n\nThe misses: beef proscuitto plate, which I thought was rather small and just couldn't get into it (I'm not much of an antipasti guy anyway); cabbage casuela, which was fine but just didn't draw me in; the lamb and veal sausages, which were very lamb-y in flavor, overpowering the pur\u00e9ed eggplant and bell pepper at the base of the dish.\n\nMy friend and I didn't do the Ambar Experience; in general, it's probably not worth it unless you expect to have more than two drinks and are reasonably hungry.  Service was good, seated next to the window was lovely.  Worth another visit in the future.", "I was in the DC area for a doctor's appointment, so my boyfriend and I decided to go back to Ambar for the first time in nearly three years. We were hoping it would live up to our past memories and it actually ended up exceeding them.\n\nMy boyfriend decided that we were going to do the Balkan Experience, so that we could sample a variety of different tapas. We each ended up choosing three tapas in addition to a chef's tasting of kajmak and the chef's tasting of spreads. We were a bit too ambitious and this ended up being entirely too much food, but it was all delicious. My personal favorites of the tapas we ordered were the Balkan salad, the cheese pie, and the chef's tasting of kajmak. I only ended up trying a mojito, but that was very good too.\n\nI think it is definitely worth it to do the Balkan Experience if you are in a large group or unfamiliar with Balkan cuisine. Overall, Ambar is a fun tapas bar that is definitely worth a visit when in DC.", "You absolutely have to get the unlimited dishes option for $35 ($49 with drinks).

We should've tried the apple pie dessert, but didn't save room. Don't make the same mistake that we did. When we first watched in there is an open kitchen type setting, where one of the chefs was hand crafting freshly made apple pie...it looked decadent.\n\nOverall, great place to get some great cocktails/wine and yummy food in a more upscale setting. It is located in the Park Hyatt hotel, with an all glass ambiance. They even have all glass mini rooms within the restaurant that you can dine in and feel as though you are having your own private dinner, but with the view of the rest of the restaurant. Worth asking about if you want a more one on one setting.\n\nWould like to go back and also check out their brunch menu.", "I guess the \"Tavern\" in the name refers to the food being served in casserole dishes. Or maybe the apple pies on the counter. No matter, because I really didn't find much tavern about this place. Huge windows? Well, the place does have the tavern-ish dark tables.\n\nAfter noticing the open kitchen, we sit down. Looking at the menu, I discover some of the meat and produce used here is brought in from Pennsylvania of all places. And other items are from local farms, and still others are from farms across the nation. From the descriptions of the offerings, we learn that the chefs are big on using fire in their cooking---all dishes seem to be either wood roasted, braised or cooked slowly over flame.\n\nWith apologies to Donald, I had the soft-shell crab. It seemed inappropriate not to have at a place with \"duck\" in its name. But I went against the grain. It was deliciously crispy.

The outdoor patio is lovely but the indoor seating with the open air kitchen is really nifty too. Lots of fresh produce and tantalizing baked goods are everywhere you look and yet the place is pristine. Lots of wood and marble and whatnot with a very minimalist and sophisticated vibe.\n\nThe staff is top notch.

All tasting menus inevitably have their ups and downs, but having dined here several times, I've found the majority of dishes to be excellent. My favorites include the couscous with uni and roe, and the duck with foie gras, which is decadently rich and simply phenomenal.\n\nThe \u00e0 la carte options don't disappoint either, especially the family-style dishes. I tried the chicken la'acha on one occasion, which was excellent - roasted to tender perfection, and reminiscent of a more traditional preserved lemon chicken tagine.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated elegantly; the main dining room features lofty ceilings and a modern ambiance, while the upstairs section has a more intimate vibe. Communal tables and a beautifully designed bar are available for walk-ins.\n\nA decent wine selection and a strong cocktail program round out the experience. Paired with attentive and friendly yet unintrusive service, Mourad has become one of my favorite restaurants in SF.", "I went to Mourad with seven other souls and everyone had a very good time and a very good meal.  Likewise the service was top notch.  We were seated on the second floor, which is a bit of a dead zone, the first floor being much more up-tempo and lively.  However, the second floor worked for us as we were talking business and the dead zone works quite well for that type of affair.\n\nMy appetizer was the basteeya which came chock full of duck confit.  Very good and beautifully  plated.\n\nMy main course of black cod came with peas, chanterelles, wheat berry, ginkgo nut, and saffron.  Again beautifully plated and the juxtapositions of texture were impressive.  And the fish was perfectly cooked.  \n\nI had a taste of a colleagues lamb and it was very good so far as I was concerned, but not remarkable.\n\nWe also ordered a main of couscous with garbanzo, honey, saffron, lemon, harissa and brown butter for the table.  This was perhaps the big winner of the meal.\n\nEveryone was too full for desert but they serve really good coffee.", "Mourad is an amazing fine-dining experience with world-class food and service. We came here on my birthday for dinner and had the Octopus, Scallops, Basteeya, and lamb entree.\n\nThe flavors in every dish were new and inspiring. Our server told us the Basteeya was the dish they got their Michelin star for and came out as our 2nd course. It's essentially a flaky puff pastry with duck, raisins, spices, and tasted a touch sweet. It is incredibly good but also very filling at the same time. (My fiance actually said he wished it came out later in the meal as more of an entree or even dessert with it's sweetness!)\n\nI enjoyed the other seafood dishes the best more because they were lighter and brighter. The scallops are a must-order.\n\nThey also have a very extensive wine list and the sommelier was very helpful in choosing something that went well with our dinner choices.\n\nOverall, Mourad is a special dining experience with unique dishes and flavors. It's worth visiting if you have something special to celebrate!", "Mourad restaurant is a very nice place for your dinner near finance district. Environment is nice and service is super. You can watch chefs cooking. Fortunately we saw chef Mourad Lahlou tonight. He still hands on.  I ordered Lamb, eggplant and Pear as desert. Presentation is excellent. Lamb is farm raised, not gamey. The dish has several pieces of lamb cooked in three different ways. The best one I like is the lamb belly. It's very crispy, with the fat, yammy! This is a light dish for me. No cumin and not spicy. Next time I would like to try their lamb shoulder, with more spice like cumin.", "Mourad will awaken your love of Moroccan food. Every bite is an adventure. From the appetizers, to dessert, each dish is a work of art. We had the gem lettuce to start off, which is toasted and served atop a bed of ricotta and parmesan cheese with a creamy sauce. I ordered the scallops and my partner had the lamb. The scallops are toasted to a golden crunchy brown just on the top, served atop a spiced honey sauce, with sunchokes, red cabbage and dill. The lamb is served with savory lentils that will make you wonder how you could have eaten lentils your whole life and never tasted any so good as these. The lamb is pink in the middle and seared on the outside, sliced into three large bite size pieces and stacked artfully on the plate. The lamb dish is sprinkled with eucalyptus powder and black lime juice. For dessert we had a chocolate gnash ball shaped like a portobello mushroom made of sweet firechoke paste and topped with crunchy, thin chocolate crackers. With such wonderful combinations of flavors, it is no wonder the owner wanted to share his food artistry with his San Francisco neighbors.", "Mourad is one of many favorite restaurants in the city. A little history, Mourad is the name of the owner who also owns Aziza (his mother's name) on Geary and 22nd which is currently under construction as they're remodeling it. Really good too.\n\nI went with a friend and we sat at the bar and still got great full service! The bartender/server was super helpful and i love the interior inside. The cocktails are great too and great wine list. I will definitely come back here again! The only thing is that its a bit pricey and the portions aren't that big.\n\nThings I ordered/recommend:\n- SALMON: fennel . blood orange . olive . fresh z'hug\n- BASTEEYA:  duck . persimmon . marigold . cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche . almond\n- OCTOPUS:  brussels sprouts . cauliflower . mustard . preserved lemon\n- EGGPLANT:  cucumber . oregano . pepper . flatbread . za'atar\n- LAMB:  lentil . rutabaga . maitake . eucalyptus . black lime", "Absolutely great experience with Mourad, serious five stars for the service AND the food AND the wine.

Then I switched to a plant based diet in 2017. Millennium is the the TFL for vegan cuisine in the Bay Area. This restaurant has been around for a long time, originally located in SF, but moved to Oakland. If I could, I would dine here every week. I would go just to have some drinks and the coriander & arborio crusted oyster mushrooms and pan roasted fingerling potatoes! All the dishes are full of flavor, beautifully presented, & made with love. The outdoor patio is so pretty and great for a big group of guests--just make reservations. I spent my birthday there with my whole family and it was the perfect dinner for all of us--even for my family members who are not vegan. This is a prix fixe menu that is worth every dollar and also about 1/12th the price of TFL.", "We found this place based on Yelp reviews and friends prodding and they were correct 100%. I love walking into a dim lit restaurant with good people and great aromas! Most of the time you would have to have a reservation here but we got in right at 6:00, sat at the bar, and was able to get food right away.\n\nThe dinner started with appetizers: pistachio stuffed dates. Theses were good. They had the perfect mix of salty and sweet, crunchy and chewy. Lots of texture and flavors. Shared them with the non vegan hubby and he loved it. After that we had the trumpet mushrooms with a sweet kimchi sauce. These were pretty good as well but I would suggest sharing it as it was too much fried food for just one person. After that we had the grand wnterence of a main course- smoked chard tamales. These were delicious I love a good tamale and very few place do a great vegan tamale with texture and flavors. The best thing about the tamales was the the avocado salsa! Again, not usually a big avocado fan unless done right and this was perfect!\n\nOverall it was a great night out and I am looking forward to going backs and trying something new next time!", "As far a Veggie and Vegan joints go  this is one of the best around. Visited greens a few months back, that seemed very conservative in comparison. Last time we were here it was in SF and that was an  amazing experience about 12 or more years ago. The new space is really nicely done with the aged wood and blackened and rusted metal give the place a very warm feel. Menu is varied with asian, latin and other flavor themes applied to veggie dishes. The ingredients were fresh as were the flavors. Servers were a bit aloof and not real warm and the food preparation must be on an individual basis with limited hands- as it took a while.\nFood: Pea fritters were really tasty with the sauce and everyone seemed pleased with their entrees.Stuffed Potato Croquetta sounded better than it was a bit too starchy, Korean Chile-Miso Glazed Tempeh was fine but not great. I'm not a vegetarian so reaching the mouth watering savoryness of meat may be tough with veggies only. I think the winner for us was Fresh Corn Tamale. Generally, all the dishes are very good- nothing that anyone would do at home easily. It's just not a place I would rave about-but when vegans come to visit, we always recommend Millennium.", "I really love that in their move from San Francisco to Oakland, Millennium's made their offering more accessible and casual. Whereas Millennium in SF felt much more like a special-occasion-only sort of spot, I can totally see myself coming here to the new Rockridge outpost on an ordinary week night (especially to have the red lentil coconut curry, which is incredibly tasty).\n\nI love a good produce forward meal and Millennium definitely delivers that, from the piquant peach salad to the substantial cauliflower main. I also love the creativity in the dishes, particularly prevalent in the sesame and arborio crusted king trumpet mushrooms with apricot-chile jam, which is possibly the most whimsical appetizer I've had this year.\n\nMillennium replaced Box and Bells (a place with a menu with which I struggled - nothing ever called to me) and I couldn't be happier to welcome this innovative vegan eatery to College Avenue.", "This was an impressive experience!!  We had a wonderful time celebrating our anniversary.  \n\nMeal standouts were the unique coriander and allspice pickled cucumber,  hickory smoked carrots with tarragon,  and the chickpea salad with fennel.  Chef Eric Tucker did a phenomenal job!  I left feeling inspired.  I'd love to see him on Mind of a Chef.  It would be a treat to learn where his inspirations have come from and how he has arrived at his current place in his culinary journey. Thank you!!\n\nThe only small draw back was the noise level.  \n\nOverall a very, favorable meal.  \n\nOur server was awesome,  she went the extra mile to be sure we had the best dining experience possible!", "I was prepared to not love this restaurant. I looked at the menu beforehand and felt like everything started out sounding good, and then...oh, why would they add pomegranate to that? Smoked pear ketchup? Hazelnuts and pumpkin seeds? Hmm. I tend to like unfussy dishes, for ingredients to shine on their own.\n\nBut I was careful about what I ordered, and this was one of the best, fanciest meals I've had in a while. The starters were all excellent, including the trumpet mushrooms everyone insists that you eat. (I did have some tastes of other mains that made me happy with my choice.)\n\nI am vegetarian who loves eggs and dairy, and I was impressed by the vegan lemon meringue sundae. How they managed to make lemon curd, meringue and ice cream without eggs is quite the mystery. The meringue texture was closer to \u00e9cume, but everything else was spot on.\n\nThe atmosphere was beautiful, and the service good. A great place to be wowed!", "This place is so good!

Turns out they scrapped the set menu, and you can order whatever upstairs and downstairs.\n\nI started with a Mister J Stanton: Rutte celery gin, house blend vermouth, celery bitters, and a pickled quail egg. Normally, I like my martinis slightly dirty, but this was one of the best dry martinis I've had, and I loved the zingy punch of the pickled egg.\n\nOur favorite dish was the beet and avocado with sunflower seeds and dukkah, topped with purslane. I enjoyed every single bite--what a great flavor combination.\n\nTheir duck pate itself was good, but complemented by house-made spicy purple mustard and lightly pickled shallot, radish, and parsley, it became just right.\n\nWe'll definitely be back. Food, drinks, and service all exceeded expectations, and I'm looking forward to spending an evening relaxing in the lounge area.", "This is hands down one of the best restaurants in the Bay Area. From the service, the food, and the atmosphere, each experience is top notch. What truly shot an arrow through my heart the first time I went, was that they served my martini in the same vintage glassware that my late mother had as her wedding crystal from 1962. The attention to mid century detail is stunning, but that's not all they have to offer. I've been at least a half dozen times for dinner, and the servers are attentive, flexible and beyond generous. They also know how to surprise and delight. Shannon has taken great care to make sure each experience is wonderful, she truly goes above and beyond. I love that the staff remembers me every time I return, as well as my favorite cocktail. Each dish is an adventure and impeccably plated. My favorites are the deviled duck eggs, warm olive appetizer, any crudo they offer, the burger (and omg those fries!) the broccoli casserole, and of course, the cocktails and desserts. I will return for special occasions or just because they are an awesome establishment. Keep up the great work, Bardo! Please don't ever change because you have a great thing going.", "This place is fantastic! Amazing drinks, food and service. It's really the whole package. And yes, it's super cool 60s interior is impressive. Every detail down to the glasses has been thought out and executed upon impeccably.\n\nMy dining mate and I ordered 5 dishes: porcupine meatballs, broccolini casserole, heirloom tomato salad on eggplant puree, halibut crudo, and fried quail.  This was probably a dish or two too many but I'm glad we got a sampling of their offerings. The tomato salad was good, but heavier than we expected. The rest were amazing. Complex flavors, the halibut had a spiciness to it that was unexpected and fantastic.\n\nI really enjoyed the entire experience and will be returning soon and often.", "The second stop on a first date and kinda wish it would have been the first! This place is so sexy 70s chic, like out of a scene in Casino. The decor, ambiance and music just amped up my love for this place. We didn't get to check out the upstairs area because it was closed but there was a ladder leading up to the upstairs area above the door and stairs (thank goodness) on the other side. I would have opted for the side with the fair had it been opened.\n\nTheir drink menu is pretty, hip with the a variety of flavors used to accentuate their most popular whiskey based drinks such as grapefruit and ginger that stored in glass bottles, oh you fancy huh?!\n\nWe decided to keep it simple and go with Tito's on the rocks with slices of lime. Once we had our drinks we headed over to the velvet love seat in the front of the bar that's perfect for an intimate convo. There's a piece of art hanging in that area that kept us engaged for awhile as we tried to decipher what it was.\n\nGreat space, love the decor, great drinks, sexy vibe right in the heart of a Lakeshore.", "Hip bar and restaurant in the 'burbs of Oakland. Great spot for a date dinner upstairs or a cocktail party with friends in the lounge downstairs.\n\nMany places have their exotic and creative house cocktail concoctions, and Bardo has many that actually sound and ARE tasty and drinkable. The cocktail list here totally delivers.\n\nThe dinner menu is a throwback in terms of dish descriptions, and the food is excellent, fresh and au courant. Deviled duck eggs are an excellent appetizer, and the steak bites salad is an excellent way to get some high-quality protein in a basket of flavorful fresh greens. The pasta was a kale and sausage feast the night I was there, and lemme tell ya it was outstanding.\n\nCan't end my review without mentioning that if you are from Wisconsin, Bardo will give you massive deja vu.

Kismet (affectionately called Kizzy in my house) is my favorite neighborhood restaurant that isn't even in my neighborhood. So delicious it's worth the Uber!\n\nThe light and space is so stunning during the day, very relaxed and inviting. If you're feeling like you need to treat yourself (you are) then the flaky bread is the world's most ultimate no-brainer. Hoo boy, you gotta order that. The broccoli toast is another must, so go hungry and double down! Wash it all down with a cardamom coffee, which is truly a delight.\n\nFor dinner I would recommend taking a couple of friends along with you so you can sample as many dishes as possible! Some recent highlights include the eggplant with hazelnuts and plum, the green beans, which are perfectly crunchy and dressed to perfection, and the marinated feta with grapefruit and tomato--so heavenly! Of course, you'll need a serve of crispy rice to make the most of all the schmears and spreads those dishes are served atop.\n\nTerrific service, incredible food, very fun wine list. #1 on my list for eating out in LA.", "Hottest new restaurant in the neighborhood! New place that recently opened, and it is packed out the door. We made a reservation for 9:30PM and still had to wait 15-20 minutes before we got seated. So definitely make a reservation before coming!\n\nFood is Mediterranean flavors. Some favorites of the night: Fried Cauliflower with yogurt, Lemony Chicken and Pine Nut pies, Jeweled Crispy Rice with runny egg, Freekeh Fritters with green sauce, and the Squid salad.\n\nEverything was super tasty and flavorful. Service was great even though they were super busy. Definitely a great new addition to the neighborhood!\n\nParking: Street parking.", "Very mixed feelings about this place.    First of all the food is really quite good.  Excellent ingredients and made extremely well.   Definitely a creative take on traditional middle eastern food.  \n\nThe problem with this place is that dishes are over priced.   Lunch for two, without drinks, came out to about $60, with one appetizer and 2 dishes.   It just didn't feel worth it for the kind of food and the ambience.\nThere is a homey feel to the food that doesn't go well with the pricing.  Also, service is very basic and also not commensurate to the pricing.\n\nOne thing that bothered us is that they add a 20% tip to the bill.  Which is fine, but then they go on to say (in the menu) that additional tip is appreciated and will be shared with the staff.   So do I feel guilty about not adding an additional 10 or 20%?   Which means to leave guilt free you really need to put down more than 30% of tip.   Kind of a turn off.  \n\nSo I would recommend this place for the food only.    I personally will never go back since the overall value is bellow my expectation.", "It's not cheap -- but this place has instantly become one of my favorite restaurants in Los Feliz and in LA.

The dishes are creative, delicious, and perfectly plated for your Yelp and Instagram needs. All of the snacks, entrees, and sides we tried were spectacular but the knock-out favorites of the evening were in no particular order:\n\n1) Fried cauliflower with the caper yogurt.\n2) Fried potatoes with labneh, macadamia nut, shavings of cured scallops, and urfa pepper.\n3) Barbari bread (especially when dipped in the preserved lemon butter compound from the Tokyo turnips dish).\n\nThe ambiance somehow manages to balance minimalist and bright with rustic and welcoming. This would be a great spot to bring a date.", "Lately I have been craving Mediterranean food and found this nice gem! I decided to try their Shakshuka dish.\n\nShakshuka is a dish of poached egg in tomato sauce. Mediterranean cuisine has so many distinct flavors, textures and of course delicious bread!

I asked to be reseated since our party of 3 was placed at a two top. She said it wasn't possible. After a drink was spilled in my lap and then another was knocked over on my husband we got up and were offered another table. The hostess came over and said to me \"I think you did that on purpose\". I'm standing in the middle of your restaurant looking like I pissed my pants and your response is to blame me so I can get a slightly larger table? She then proceeded to bring the knocked over and now half empty bottle over to our new table along with a torn napkin/rag for me to wipe myself down?\n\nDinner was fine.

Boiled fish was five stars, the most complex of several versions I've had. Toothpick lamb was a-ok, with too subtle cumin taste.

Here's what you should try:\n\n- Tea smoked ribs:  when you saw this dish on almost every table in the restaurant, you know it's going to be good.  The meat just falls right off the bone and has a smoky delicious flavor.  So good.  \n\n- Garlic shredded pork:  this is a cold dish, and the sauce flavor really gets into the pork.  So good!\n\n- Mapo tofu:  Kind of a standard pick at a szechuan restaurant, but they make it on point.  So glad there were none of those little numbing balls that some restaurants put in their mapo tofu dishes.  It is quite spicy so beware, but that's why I loved it!\n\n- Lamb on toothpick:  This was good, not incredibly special, but still delicious\n\n- steamed rice powder-coated pork:  omg this is a childhood favorite for me, but normally the meat has bones.  But here, they make it with pork belly, so you can just put the food in your mouth without having to pick off any bones.  LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Oh yeah, and the portion is HUGE.  \n\nDoggy tip:  they even have outdoor sitting for your fur-friends!", "A fresh, elegant take on Sichuan fare: the fish fillets in green peppercorn were much more subtle and layered in flavor than the same dish at Chengu Taste.\n\nEach dish we tried was informed by a modern culinary intelligence and very well executed. The Impressive Cold Noodles turned DanDan on its head: the meatless red Chile sauce was less oily than expected, and balanced the cool noodles perfectly.\n\nMa Po Tofu was the most traditionally prepared - still an excellent version of a classic. The Krinkle Kut fries (street corner potato strips) with chili dusting was nifty but in a one-liner sort of way.\n\nThe highlight was the boiled whitefish fillets in green peppercorn sauce. I really enjoy this dish at nearby Sichuan champ Chengu Taste, but the version at Sichuan Impression is better executed. The spice doesn't hit you like a hammer- so you can taste the fish and enjoy its texture on your tongue.\n\nLooking forward to returning to try more dishes!", "The food is good but the flavor is on the salty and spicy side.

Those whiffs of leather have been replaced by red awnings, scents of pastries and an excellent oyster-filled raw bar completing its Parisian transformation.\nIt seems as though every other table is topped with their bestselling steak frites or Le Balthazar, that towering seafood feast and signature since the late '90s.

It's huge, rustic and seemingly very popular with the young and the beautiful, the well-heeled and the well-traveled (read: tourists).\n\nThere are daily specials but I'm preferential to the Balthazar bar steak, which is essentially steak-frites served with a bearnaise. Ordered medium-rare, it comes out nearly perfect with a slight char on the exterior. The french fries are pretty standard, which is to say, great. My friend ordered the duck confit, which came out crispy and well seasoned, although a little dry. His escargots were better in my opinion, simple and served in a very garlicky butter. A cote du rhone suggested by our waiter paired nicely with the meal and was reasonably priced at just over $30.\n\nUltimately the food and the experience at Balthazar is everything that it should be in a bistro/brasserie: solid and reliable. The caveat is that nearly everything is also a little pricier than it probably should be. The service, however, is impeccable, which is made more impressive by the cramped, packed-in layout of the dining area that ensures everyone gets jostled at least a dozen times during their meal. The wine list is a sizeable selection from France (of course) with an emphasis on Bordeaux.", "NYC institution. Reservations are a must since it can get very jammed - but sometimes you can get lucky with a spot at the bar. Been going for over 10 years now and can say it's consistently great. They did change up the cote de boeuf and it's a little different than what they used to serve, but the items for 2 are excellent nonetheless. (roast chicken, fish with basmati rice, steaks) Raw bar is probably one of the best in the city - oysters are fresh, king crab claws are amazing. You'll see several tables doing just the seafood towers - it's that good.  \n\nAtmosphere is always bustling but service is polished.

It's lively enough for groups, yet cozy and fun for dates as well.", "There's nothing I could say that hasn't already been said about Balthazar. Many of its detractors try to paint it as an expensive faux-french tourist attraction. You can however go there any time of the day and find it filled with locals enjoying excellent food and cocktails as well. I could have lunch, brunch and dinner at Balthazar and probably breakfast too if I was up at those hours.\n\nThe place's ouefs at brunch will have you gushing. Pair that with their breadbasket and you'll find yourself visiting their bakery more than often.

We just finished a late brunch at Penelope's three hours earlier so I ordered a light fare. I started with the escargot. The contraption provided to secure the escargot is a little tricky to grasp at first. You must squeeze the levers to open the up the contraption to secure the shell like pliers. Then use the fork or a toothpick to the snail out. There is a slight learning curve. The table next to me gave up and asked the waiter to pick out all the meat out of the shells for them. The garlic butter that accompanied the escargot was absolutely divine. I ended up asking for more bread to dip in the sauce. The escargot appetizer came with 6 shells for $21. For my entree, I ordered half a dozen of oysters for $24. The oysters were a bit disappointing since they were so small. For dessert, I had the strawberry shortcake which was amazing as well.\n\nMy dinner mate ordered the SAUT\u00c9ED SKATE with raisins, capers, toasted pistachios and celery root pur\u00e9e (31.00) which was an amazing fish.

Great French bistro-esque food with a great oyster and raw bar selection to escargot and mousses. The steak au poivre was perfect. The Steak had just the right amount of pepper crust and cognac cream to compliment it. The duck confit was superbly tender over braised red cabbage with figs and pistachios. We finished wit the meal with a Banana ricotta tart that didn't disappoint. Ripe caramelized bananas sat atop a light ricotta cream along some banana ice cream. The dessert wasn't overly sweet which I loved. Lastly, the service was spectacular.  The maitre d' who seated us earlier than our reservation with no problem.

I have yet to find another place that serves burritos and tacos with ingredients as fresh as La Azteca.\nI would highly recommend the carne asada burrito or carnitas burrito with the chile relleno, which is a pepper stuffed with cheese.

Food was good and is thoroughly described in other reviews.  However, there are other factors to consider.  You can't expect much in the way of atmosphere or service in hole-in-the-wall establishments, but you should expect a modicum of comfort.  For example, there is no air conditioning, so it can get oppressively hot.  There is also exactly ONE table, so if you go in a group, don't expect to sit together (they also have counter seating).  They are not quick, so expect a wait.  They also screwed up an order for one of our party, so she had to wait an extra long time.  Finally, when we went, they were out of tacos.  We were some of the first ones there, so it wasn't like they ran out in the middle of a busy lunch hour, they just had not prepared well enough in advance.\n\nThat being said, everyone that I went with enjoyed the food.

I feasted on the chorizo and egg burrito, and I'm proud to say that I finished the whole thing.  See what perseverance can do?  All the flavors were right on, and the salsa provided that extra kick of heat that made me regret that I didn't order a drink.\n\nWhile I wanted to eat more, I just simply couldn't...so I guess I'll have to go back...but THIS time, I'm going to make sure to grab a dozen tortillas to-go so that I can try to recreate the magic at home.\n\nIf you have friends in from out of town, or you've already tried every burrito in a 5 mile radius of your home, give La Azteca a try.  But, allow some time, because the secret has been out for years...which means your mouth will water for about 30 minutes before you get your food.\n\nBuen provecho!", "La Azteca burritos is indeed a neighborhood delight.

Also, the quantities are generous. Highly recommended.\n\nPS I don't know why there is hostility about their authenticity. They aren't a mass market place catering to mainstream tastes, and they're very honest about that.

I don't think you could find a food blog or forum on the Internet that didn't recommend EMP as a dining hot spot in this city.\nI came here for the excellently priced lunch and did not leave disappointed. The amuse bouche were outstanding and my fregola salad with octopus, chickpeas and fennel was fresh and delightful with a playful balance of texture and acidity that seemed to draw inspiration from Spain but put together with a more French elegance. My Bouillabaisse was rich a flavourful and although I probably prefer a bolder interpretation of the dish Humm's creation was none the less excellent. The dining room is a beautiful space and the greenery outside the windows that filters the sunshine also helps you escape from the bustle of Manhattan outside. An elegant oasis that one does not want to leave in a hurry.\n\nService was courteous and professional but perhaps lacked the charisma and personality to lift it to the highest level. I would definitely love to return to EMP in the evening to experience a much more involved and extended experience.", "Eleven Madison was our anniversary gift in instead getting each other something tangible.

They were delectable.\n\nI had perused the EXTENSIVE wine list online and had narrowed my selection before we spoke to the extremely knowledgeable sommelier.

Everything about the decor is elegant; I loved the high ceilings, which added to the spacious atmosphere.\n\nThe food was indescribably out of the world. Each dish was a piece of art - some standouts were the play on a breakfast egg's benedict with caviar and the duck. I still dream of that piece of duck to this day. You can tell how much time and effort the entire team puts into creating each dish - everything is perfectly detailed, balanced, and whimsical in aesthetics and taste. Additionally, each dish was perfectly portioned - you don't feel that you're going into a food coma when you leave, which happens quite often for tasting menus. A quick tour of the kitchen was the perfect ending to our dinner.\n\nThey recently updated their reservation system on their website, allowing for you to see what's available per day on a calendar.

They also have a chirashi, which consists of small chopped pieces of tempura accompanied with luxurious uni and ikura.\n\nDespite being offered as a takeout option, the box was unbelievably delicious. Although the batter is a big component of tempura, the real key is the ingredients. The tempura was fried expertly to ensure the textures and flavors of each ingredient was brought out. Shrimp, crab, halibut, pumpkin, and asparagus were all a treat to have. When tempura is done correctly, everything isn't greasy or oily, which results in a meal that isn't heavy.\n\nLA is a town that is more known for its sushi than tempura.

We got seated by the counter.  They brought in two different salt dishes for dipping tempuras...ok...then we realized they made a very simple cooking 101 mistake with serving us sugar over salt!!!  At first bite of tempura, we were just looking at each other like there is something wrong here, but didn't bring it up.  But later when we told the chef about it, he did apologize, but not as apologetic as you should be by someone who works at a elegant place like this one.  Server came back with salt for  everyone and chef gave us a complimentary ika tempura.  He should had given us wagyu beef instead of ika for making such a beginner's mistake!\n\nEndo in Kyoto would blow your mind...not this place.", "We got the Kiyomizu set:\n\n1.

Do other people normally spoon dipping yogurt in their mouth? Anyhow i figured I could ask for more bread. The main dish came out and I ordered baby lamb kebab with white rice. The lamb was tender but really lacked any flavor...I think all they did was grill it. I didn't taste any marination at all. It almost felt like eating well done steak but put it back on the grill and poured water on it and covered it  to absorb the water back into it.

My wife's \"rack of lamb\" (4 lamb chops) were just okay but the eggplant that it was served with had no personality.

For Benedict , the egg is poached perfectly, the salmon is fresh ,and I like the topping hollandaise sauce .very light and flavorful! For French toast, it is served with banana and walnut on its top. My friends said it was a little bit sweet but it is great to me. Just like a dessert. You need to eat it right now before it gets cold.

Definitely we will come back", "A place with so many positive reviews is going to be busy right? Well good thing we accounted for it before coming here. We allowed ample wait time and went during off hours to avoid long wait times. Our plan worked and we only had a relatively short wait. We were seated by the window which was nice. Our server was prompt at getting us menus and taking our drink orders when we sat. She was patient with us as we looked through the menu to make our selection. With how busy this place is, above average customer service.\n\nMink ordered the Pancakes with Warm Maple Butter and I ordered the Fried Chicken & Waffles with a Clinton St. Bloody Mary to wash it down.

Our server got our order into the kitchen before the rush so we got our food quickly. The portions were HUGE! Mink's pancakes were very fluffy. My chicken was very moist and tasty. The waffle was soft and just paired perfectly with the chicken. There was also this red and greed hot sauce that I added to every bite of my meal. This place didn't disappoint and I see why they are so highly rated.", "I've been living in the neighborhood for many years and wasn't able to try this place out because of the ridiculous weekend crowds. I finally remembered to check it out during the week when I had a day off and it definitely lived up to its reputation.\n\nThe menu has a great mix of sweet and savory options for brunch from pancakes to every kind of egg dish imaginable.  I had the potato pancakes, friend green tomatoes and the Spanish chorizo omelet.  The tomatoes were friend to perfections with just the right amount of seasoning in the breading. The potato pancakes were light and flavorful and the addition of smoked salmon and a hard-boiled egg on top was perfection.  The omelet seemed to be one of the weaker choices on the menu.

The Waitress explained that brunch is the crowd drawer.   The place was clean.  The bathroom was clean.  We had the chicken and waffles with sides of sugar bacon,  double smoked bacon and french fries. The chicken stole the show.  The portions were large and the taste great. It is worth the trip for the chicken alone.  My only negative was the service which was fast any other time that would be a plus but because the place was empty they came to the table entirely too much.  It's a fine line between attentiveness and making one feel like saying will you please leave us alone so we can eat in peace.  Yes I would go again.  Side note for management, if your server has a hand injury that is all covered in an ace bandage switch  the persons task until their healed or but a glove on that hand.", "Every trip to NY I try to look for new restaurants.

The wait staff is friendly and helpful and always attentive. Now for the food- my husband and I like to order a sweet dish and a savory dish and then split both. We had the bacon, egg, cheese, and tomato jam biscuit and the seasonal apple pie waffle. The food was UNBELIEVABLE!!! The ingredients were fresh and high quality.

This is some quality sushi.\n\nWe had originally planned to go to Fresca but when we got there we decided we were craving sushi. We literally walked one block and found this place. The restaurant is really small and the wait time was an hour and a half, but we were okay with eating outside on a pretty cold night since they had a heater so we got seated right away.\n\nWe had the spicy cracker for an appetizer and the white out roll and watermelon roll for our main dinner. The spicy cracker was exactly what I wanted. The seaweed was tempura-fried to perfection with great quality spicy tuna and avocado on top. The watermelon roll was delicious as well, I loved the garlic ponzu on it. But my favorite was definitely the white out roll. That butter fish on top just melted in my mouth. With the garlic ponzu, it was just the perfect bite.\n\nThis place is definitely a little pricier with smaller portions than most other sushi restaurants, but you know why when you taste the quality of their fish. And what's even better is they use light, refined flavors, like their sweet soy sauce and garlic ponzu, to highlight their fish, unlike other places that mask their fish with citrus or creamy sauces. This is my kind of sushi.", "Another amazing fresh sushi place in the city. The seating is limited so be sure to have your party there when it opens. We started off with the tasting spoons, one torotoro and one kanpachi. Both were so good. Then we opted for an order of sashimi and nigiri tastings each. Everything was great, but I would say go with the sashimi next time. The cuts were big and juicy, much more worth than the nigiri. I really loved this little imitation crab and cucumber appetizer before the entrees came. They also have a pretty wide selection of sake to choose from if you'd want a glass or two. A great place for a date night if you don't want to break the bank at some other $$$$ omasake spots.", "Great sushi bar in Noe Valley. My partner used to live in Noe Valley and Saru quickly became a weekend lunch tradition.\n\nGet there early if you don't want to wait. The restaurant fills up very quick. One time we waited two hours for dinner. Luckily they use a text message based system so we were able to walk around.\n\nSome of my favorites\n\nOmakase Nigiri - Always a wonderful selection of fresh fish. I feel it's a great variety of fish and fattiness.\n\nOtoro or Chutoro Nigiri - Sometimes we'll add on a few pieces of delicious tuna.\n\nHamachi Truffle - A wonderful starter. I love the flavor of this dish.\n\nWhite out roll - Love the taste of the seared fish.\n\nService is excellent at Saru. The staff is attentive, friendly, and efficient. And can recommend dishes to you if needed. The sushi chefs are hard working and very consistent. If you sit at the bar the chef will most likely hand you your items directly.\n\nOne time the chef gave us both a tuna rib. The meat was delicious! I don't think you can order this on the menu so it was a very special treat.\n\nEven after we moved far away from Noe Valley, we still made the trek for Saru. Definitely recommend this awesome sushi bar.", "Sushi was very fresh but at those prices, that should be given.  We came here for a low-key anniversary dinner.  The tasting spoons were lovely.  We had two sets and were able to taste all options. The amberjack was lovely, as well as the ankimo. We also did the salmon tasting and a sushi tasting. I thought the salmon roe was the most subtle roe I've had in a long time. Two of the salmon sashimi were exquisite, the rest were standard.  (I don't remember which was which).  The hamachi kama was perfection.  I appreciated the subtle flavors of the sashimi and sushi. There were layers of flavors in some of the sashimi that I wasn't expecting and were fairly surprising.  \n\nI liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. It's tiny and mostly hushed.  The only thing that I found disappointing was the couple at the bar whose obnoxious and loud conversation dampened my enjoyment such lovely and subtle flavors. Since they were regulars there, I am not compelled to want to come here that often.  A bummer, since it's wonderful sushi and in my neighborhood.\n\nOverall, however, wonderful and modern take on traditional Japanese flavors.", "Love this place!\nKani miso (snow crab leg topped with crab butter) is my favorite! I can sit here and just order a bunch of this and still be perfectly happy. Except for the fact that everything else in their menu is good too! Hamachi truffle is delicious.

The coat check service was also a nice touch.\n\nEverybody raves about the tempura elotes...but my most favorite single bite was the Crispy Vietnamese Crepe. The flavors were bright, fresh, tangy, and spicy all in one. After that, it was hard to rank all of the other dishes. The Duck Dumplings probably come in second. The finishing touch of pouring pho broth into the bowl of dumplings table side was cool. The dish was warming, savory and completely satisfying.\n\nWe went with the suggestion of 3 dishes per person.

For the fish section we went with the waiters recommendation of the Cobia Coconut curry, and it did not disappoint. For the third section we went all out and ordered the BBQ Lamb Ribs, Thai Beef Salad, Wagyu Beef Short-rib & the Young Chicken.

The best dish of the night was the fried fish collars with thai garlic-chili sauce. The dish is a reminiscence of what you could get in Bangkok as street food.

You pick up your sandwich with a ticket and find a seat to enjoy the deliciousness. Both sandwiches had a generous portion of meat and that's all it is in the sandwich. Bread and meat. Yes it might be a bit pricy for a sandwich but after one bite, you'll know it's worth it. I have been trying other delis to compare and none comes close. Once you are finish you bring your ticket to the exit and pay.", "One cannot visit NYC and not stop for a pastrami sandwich and one of its delis.  The hubby really wanted to try Katz's, mostly because it's heavily favored by Anthony Bourdain.  I don't know if I should admit this, but I had never heard of Katz's before.  Seems like it's such a landmark that it should be part of the definition of \"New York City\".\n\nThis place is unbelievably crowded, even at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon (there aren't too many restaurants in my hometown that will have a line out the door at 3pm), but when all was said and done, the pastrami sandwich was worth weathering the wait and chaos.\n\nMy hubby was really impressed that the guy carves the meat right before your eyes when you order.  It can't get any fresher than that.  And the meat is amazing - moist, juicy, and smoked to perfection.  \n\nTip: when you enter the restaurant, you opt for either self serve (you stand in line, get your own order, get your own table), or waiter service where they find a table for you and the waiter gets your food.  \n\nFor once, the hubby was right - this place is awesome.", "If you haven't been - GO!

The entire menu was revamped and Chef Matt Safarowic and his wife Christina have done an amazing job.   One of the things that make a restaurant great, is the quality of the ingredients.  Of course, the chef needs to be able to cook, and Matt more than delivers.  For lunch, there is a pork, broccoli rape and provolone sandwich that would make you cry it is so good.  Seasoned to perfection, it is a favorite go to for my wife and I.  The Pork Chop is amazing; the flavors from the Berkshire pork is extraordinary.   Pasta is another winner, and Chef Matt knows how to do it right; he is an alum of The Cookery in Dobbs Ferry, which serves extraordinary pasta.  Katonah benefits from that.  Finally, do yourself a favor and try the brunch.  The biscuits are old school, crispy and flaky.  One of the great brunch entrees is poached egg and bacon on potato latkes.  They are addictive.

It has a nice bar and the staff is very friendly, polite and knowledgeable.  This was our first time there and it was for brunch & I can't wait to go back to try lunch & dinner.  We started off our brunch with a Peach Bellini and a Grapefruit Mimosa, the Fresh biscuits with the house made Raspberry jam. The biscuits were light and buttery and the jam was velvety smooth, so good! Next we shared the Mushroom grits. The mushrooms were delicious, crisp and oozing with flavor  & the grits were perfectly creamy. A great combination, I highly recommend. Our entrees were equally delicious. I had the Latkes Benedict, the latkes taking the place of the ordinary English muffin making the dish actually much lighter, with perfectly cooked bacon and poached egg with a hollandaise sauce that had just the perfect tang & a crispy mixed green salad. My daughter had the French Toast with whipped vanilla ricotta and raspberry jam (her preference) if was offered with blood orange marmalade and powdered sugar. It was very good with thick crisp bread.\nWe also shared a side of maple bacon, sweet and crisp.  Even the coffee was good.  An all around enjoyable brunch.", "I went for lunch with my husband and mother. My husband ordered the French onion soup and it was quite possibly the best onion soup I've ever tasted!!

Reliable very good options (I have had delivered) - Dahi Aloo Papri which is mixture of crispy strips, potatoes, and chickpeas in a tamarind sauce. Yum!

Still to find an Indian restaurant with such food quality, consistency in quality, extremely courteous and friendly staff and a penchant for timely delivery. I have practically LIVED off Bukhara food for over 4 years away from India.\nFavorite items: Chicken Malai Kebab (appetizer), Dal Bukhara (I'd pick this this if asked to pick one item from the menu), chicken makhani (butter chicken), balti gosht (goat), pepper chicken, together with jalebi paratha (bread). Badami Kheer (dessert) would remind you of your grandmom's slow cooked kheer (rice pudding) from the old days.\nThe head chef is from the Bukhara chain of restaurants in India's ITC hotels, who is also one of the partners. There is just one Bukhara in the US - and there is clearly one Dal Bukhara :-)\nFor those looking at most value, try their all-you-can-eat buffet.

Bukhara Grill is as good as the best. I guess NYers feel the same, since most of the clients on this Saturday night were Indians.\n\nWe had the Mal Mal Kabob, which is ground chicken with crushed cashew baked Tandoori style -- delicious and unlike anything we've had before. Plus Sarson Ka Saag, which are minced mustard greens as a typical Indian puree. Also had minted whole-wheat bread, called Pudina Parantha, and a great spicey Masala Tea. The novel complementary appetizer of crackers, chickpeas, chutney and yogurt was also tasty, as were the chutneys for the complementary papadums. The dessert menu looked interesting too, but we were so full from dinner we couldn't try it.\n\nAttractive atmosphere and excellent service. Vegetable dishes were around $19, and meat in the mid-to-high $20's. For two dishes, tea, and a beer, the bill was $74 plus tip.

I can honestly say there was not one thing I tried that I did not like.  Great food selection and a balanced variety of flavors - spicy, sweet, salty, savory....whatever you're into they had it.  I would have liked just a little more heat on some of the spicier dishes, though I suppose most people would appreciate the mild to medium heat level.  Even the naan was incredible, some of the best I've ever had.  It was perfect for dipping in all the leftover sauces on my plate.  My plate was so clean, they probably didn't have to wash it afterward.\n\nThe bill came to about $17 per person which is not bad at all....it may sound a little pricey for a buffet lunch (and we all just drank water), but that is to be expected when you are having a nice sit down meal in NYC, and for the quality of the food we definitely felt we got more than our money's worth.", "Excellent service!

Be sure to take a picture of the wagyu before it is cooked so you can just point to the grill master which cuts you would like to reorder again. The combination of the red wine salt and a little bit of the wasabi is great on the wagyu. We actually liked it better than the truffle salt.

The restaurant only uses Japanese A5 wagyu and it literally melts in your mouth. The marbling on the raw meat looked so pretty and just by looking at is already satisfying lol.\n\nOther dishes we ordered including chawanmushi, chadol jjim, yookhwe and sot bap were heavenly too. I especially enjoyed the uni and truffle sot bap (pot rice). It was such an amazing combination when mixed with rice and I just couldn't get enough of it! Also, they do offer a variety of drinks including soju, sake, wine and cocktails. We tried a couple of the fruity soju cocktails and they were pleasant and refreshing.\n\nPrice is steep but you get what you pay for.

The venue is sleek and the private booths make it a good date idea. The service is great, and grilling meats on the cast iron helps prevent your clothing from smelling like bbq. However, with so many Korean bbq places in the area at varying price points, I'm not sure how HYUN's over-inflated prices will attract the average customer that'll typically crave solid bbq and full stomachs. Don't get me wrong. HYUN's meats are high quality, but the portions are for toddlers and priced at 2-3x (or factoring quantity 5-6x) of your typical Korean bbq joint. Typical dishes that are complementary at most Korean restaurants are also not only not complementary here, but outrageously hiked up. HYUN is a great place to impress your date, but there are other restaurants that can do the same and for a fraction of the price.", "Thanks to @mikexingchen for your recommendation!

For just $99 per person, you can have as much waygu beef you want within 90 minutes. They even cook the food for you, so all you have to do is just tell the amazing staff what cuts you want to revisit and eat. The other surprise is the awesome #kimchi . We've had a lot of kimchi in our time and this is made in house and packed full of flavor. It's garlicky, just the right amount of sour and full of umami. If you're in #nyc and love waygu, you must come here and ask for a private room.", "AYCE A5 wagyu sounds like a helluva deal when you first hear about it. It definitely is, but restaurant-goers should be cautious. A5 wagyu is extremely fatty; so fatty that you when you eat the meat, it essentially tastes like melting fat more than meat. while good in small quantities, it becomes really difficult to manage when you're eating AYCE. Realistically, you probably can't eat more than 2 or 3 platters worth of wagyu before you start to feel bloated from the fat and oils. I would be cautious of going because you probably won't be able to eat as much as you think you can, and may want to throw up by the end of your meal. Basically, I think AYCE and A5 don't belong together. If it's your first wagyu experience, I suggest you try somewhere else where the objective isn't to try and stuff your face with as much meat as humanly possible.", "Amazing indoor experience!

The ice cream was better as I felt the custard texture was a little bit pasty, although the flavor was great. I would definitely come back and try the lamb shank, fish of the day and the vermicelli noodle dessert.  Those looked great on neighboring tables.", "Thanks to the great bartenders and delicious food, we had a great date experience on Saturday night at this unassuming, unmarked restaurant off Flatbush avenue. We didn't have reservations, but thought arriving at 6:30 would be early enough - unfortunately, the wait for two seats at the bar was still about 80 minutes. It also took what felt like a long time (realistically, about 25-30 minutes) for our food to come out. But, the two gentlemen behind the bar were great.  They guided us to order the right amount of food with the right balance of flavors, and shared interesting tidbits about chef Nasim Alikhani and the Brooklyn dining scene in general. For the meal, we shared grilled cauliflower, lamb shank, smoked eggplant and sides of herbed rice and tahdig, plus some Sancerre, all delicious. I'm kicking myself for not ordering a drink made with one of their housemade syrups.\nThe space itself feels almost like a museum, with minimalist d\u00e9cor and great lighting, and a lovely private dining space downstairs. Overall I recommend Sofreh, but prepare for a wait!", "This review is long overdue.\n\nMy husband and I celebrated our 42nd wedding anniversary with our family at Sofreh 3 months ago.\n\nWe ordered all over the menu, more than four items from each category of appetizers, salads, entrees, desserts and drinks.  Amazingly not one disappoints and many surprisingly creative; the eggplant spread with flat bread, fall-off-the-bone lamb shank, chicken with barberries, fish over stew of herb, smoke eggplant with poached eggs, rosewater custard and rosewater sorbet with frozen vermicelli rice noodles, just to name a few.\n\nBesides the delicious food and the beautiful ambiance, what made the evening even more glorious was the impeccable service. The staff helped us order the right amount of food for our party of 5, every plate was clean to the bottom before cleared off.  The owner embraced us as if we were her family.  We simply melted away in her warmth and artistry.\n\nSofreh is undoubtedly one of our brightest highlights in 42 years.", "If you want a very unique taste of Iran, this is the place. The food is very delightful and creative. It really makes your taste buds come alive. We were pleasantly surprised by the great assortment on the menu.

Both are offered under the Breakfast section available until 5pm.\n\nUnder House Specialties, we got the duck noodle soup , the stuffed cabbage, and the crab fried rice. The portions were generous but more importantly the flavors were as complex as expected for the dish (as described) and tasty. What a delight to our senses.\n\nWe saved the French toast for dessert but also added the warm coconut beignets with pandan and guava custards.\n\nWe ate everything and left no crumbs.

The disco fries are so good, that curry sauce is something I'd bathe in. It's so delicious, with the perfect amount of spice that kicks ever so slightly. The French toast is so good, I wish they would give you a little more dragon fruit but that shiz expensive i get it. The condensed milk is so good, make sure you order another side of the condensed milk sauce. You will thank me for ordering the extra! The breakfast sandwich is very good, super flavorful with Thai basil sausage that makes this breakfast wrap versatile enough to be eaten anytime of the day. Be warned its only served until 5pm. I have also tried their crabfried rice, very good but uncle boon's was better known for that dish. The chicken sandwich is amazing, it's something I'd order again.

It felt like more of an experience for me, which I crave after cooking my own meals for over a year and a half now. We both ordered the Phat See eiw with Prawns and Pea Shoots Fai Dang, which is greens sauteed with garlic, chili, and soybeans. The flavors were OUT OF THIS WORLD. I've had thai food a million times, and always love it, but the food here was a different level of delicious that I was not expecting. I can't wait to come back and try more.

Perfect spot to do a private party.", "A while back I had walked by Uncle Boon's, and I patted myself on the shoulder after my discerning nose was able to detect Michelin Star cooking that seemed extraordinary even from the street outside. While I didn't end up getting to try their food before they closed, Thai Diner is run by the same ownership, and the brunch here was truly excellent.\n\nWe started with the corn fritters, which were perfectly spiced and didn't seem overly heavy or decadent. We shared the vegetarian roti sandwich, which had the right spices in the omelette to elevate it above just another breakfast egg wrap.\n\nThe Thai tea French toast was another dish that really went above and beyond typical brunch expectations. Thai tea butter and condensed milk for toppings? Sign me up anytime.", "Honestly, Thai food cannot do me wrong. This post is already biased because my love for Thai food is unconditional.\nThe diner was so aesthetically pleasing with the classic counter and dim lighting. I ended up sitting outside because their outdoor seating design is honestly just as cool.\nI got the Phat See Ew. I LOVE flat rice noodles. The chewy texture with the eggs and broccoli. Yum. Topped with fried chicken chunks? Definitely a first for me and WOW. It was like combining my love for Thai and Spanish food (Chicharron de pollo). Soooo good. Will I come back? Hmmmmm. Ive had better Thai food, but it was a great experience. The diner/old school aesthetic is super cool.", "I've been wanting to check out this spot when I found out it was affiliated with uncle boon. I came here for lunch and they have indoor dining available as well as heated outdoor dining. I got the Thai iced tea ($4), crab fried rice ($25), and Thai diner egg sandwich ($12).\n\nThe crab fried rice was delicious! Loads of plump crab meat on top with 3 slices of cucumber and a bit of cilantro on top. The rice was a nice slight sticky texture and it also came with a lime-like sauce that was sooo good with the rice.\n\nThe Thai diner egg sandwich was very interesting and yummy. Also comes with a dipping sauce and the outside of the sandwich was a roti skin which I loved! Good amount of cheese in the sandwich and it was filling.\n\nThe interior was cute with booths and a counter. They have alcohol here too and some of them can be made into pitchers.", "Thai Diner, the offshoot and now sole survivor of the groundbreaking Uncle Boons, is now doing takeout, delivery and outdoor dining. The food is just as creative as Uncle Boons, but less spicy and maybe a bit more westernized. The flavor combinations continue to be creative and delicious. We went for brunch and will be back.

The fancier people go for Bloody Marys, and though I am still adjusting to enjoying tomatoes the thought of vodka on a morning gives me that hangover feeling. They have a seasonal menu and some specials - so I went for the Kitchen sink, a mix of spinach, lard-ons, egg, and some potatoes all fried and placed in a decent sized bowl. The savory flavors such as a hint of garlic were there, but there was just way too much oil on the plate. For a dish over $14, I also would've expected more meat bits but they were quite sparse.

Start off with some cocktails, make sure to order the off menu Housemade Spam Rice, end with the baked Hawaiian and you will find yourself satisfied and stuffed as you happily make your way out the door.\n\nFAVORITE DISHES:\n--Beef Tongue Steamed Buns\n--Tuna Poke on Nori Crackers\n--Housemade Spam on Rice** (MUST GET)\n--Clams in Coconut Curry\n--Baked Hawaiian** (MUST GET. You'll dream about this in the future.)\n\nIf you got a reason to celebrate, date night with your boo thing, or feeling $$ spendy $$, I HIGHLY recommend planning in advance (RSVP opens 30 days in advance) and coming here. Service is lovely, the open kitchen concept makes the whole place smell divine, and it's so worth the wait. If all else fails, you can always go downstairs and grab a cocktail and some bar eats at Louie's Gen-Gen Room.", "One of my favorite spots in the City.  Not only for their very friendly service and strong drinks, but also for their Spam fried rice, scallops, pork belly, duck liver, short ribs, bone marrow, and Baked Hawaii.  This list is only scratching the surface, as there are more menu items that I NEED to go back for.\n\nDuck liver toast with pickled pineapple and celery is a great starter.  Not too heavy and kinda refreshing.  One toast can be shared by two, but can easily not be shared.  Wink wink.  \n\nThanks to their house-made Spam, the fried rice dish with mushrooms & corn is a must have at every visit.  And we all know that fried rice goes with everything!    \n\nScallops and pork belly was my favorite ...in texture, plating, and taste.  Love the presence of dill in this dish.\n\nEverything about their short rib and bone marrow dish was spectacular.  The short rib was grilled to perfection and enhanced simply with fresh horseradish shavings and a chimichurri sauce.  Their bone marrow was extraordinary in an amazing way.  Baked with escargot and potato, I just couldn't have enough of their marrow ...served in a humongous bone.      \n\nFor dessert, their Baked Hawaii is to die for.  Just one spoonful of this showstopper will make you think you're in paradise.  \n\nAloha!", "I spent months eyeing this restaurant during shelter in place and was lucky enough to get a reservation (1 week ahead on site) to take some friends visiting from Austin.

It is also very difficult to get reservations - probably adds to the hype. Fantastic service and fun environment (ie. safe date place).\n\nDefinitely enjoyed the food, but it was a little more salty for my palate. We went big and ordered the beef ribs. Since it was one of the most expensive dishes on the menu, we expected to be wowed...but it was a little salty, had to order rice to balance the taste. BUT, we were blown away by the dessert! Definitely order the Baked Hawaii - it is exactly like its name and gives you a taste of Hawaii. The tuna poke was also appetizing. We topped our dishes with a Hawaiian staple, spam fried rice. They may not advertise it on the menu but you can just ask for it.\n\nOverall, great experience at one of the few Hawaiian restaurants in the city. But, I expected more for a place that is hyped up quite frequently.", "Dined here 3 years ago, but finally had the time to write this review thanks to COVID-19.

Our server was very friendly and welcoming.\n\nThe menu is small, with just a few starters/snacks, appetizers, pastas, and mains but we were able to put together a pretty decent set of plates to share.  We had a cheeseboard and loved all of the cheeses they selected. We then snacked on the spicy tater tots (can't go wrong with crisp tots!) before our loaded baked potato ravioli and ribeye arrived.  The steak is sold by the ounce and is perfect for sharing. It's smothered with garlicky butter which made it so tasty. Ours was a little on the too-much-fat side but good nonetheless. The ravioli was fantastic.

It's also the awesome staff, who welcomed us warmly and looked after us attentively throughout our meal. As we walked out, a bunch of people from the chef to the servers and others said goodbye - how often does one that level of treatment? Very impressed! I felt immediately drawn back.\n\nMy favorite dishes were the smoked trout dip, loaded baked potato dumplings, and corn tres leches. Their house made ciabatta was oh so good. Everything was presented well and had delicious combinations of flavors. Nice portion sizes and great for sharing, and the timing of the food coming out was perfect. Looking forward to trying their steaks and cheese boards next time.\n\nProud to have this wonderful establishment in my town.

The room is very nice and they have a little market at the front of the restaurant. The service needs improvement. Our friends tried this place and said the same thing-- that the food was good but the service--not so much. Everyone is polite but there is no sense of urgency at all. You'll need to ask for everything. This is easy to fix and I have high hopes for this restaurant. The worst part was that some of the cooks in the kitchen weren't wearing their masks the entire time we were there. All of the other employees were properly wearing masks but the folks preparing the food didn't seem to think they had to follow the rules. They were tasting food and sipping broth (?) as they were cooking. I hope we weren't being served from the same container they were drinking out of.

Lovely outdoor seating area and bustling indoor seating plus market add to the environment.\n\nHighly recommended.", "We came here with a group of friends and we all ordered plates to share which was great because we got to try a little bit of everything.\n\nWe started with two charcuterie plates all the cheese we had were amazing!

You may also pay for a $25 per person deposit after making a reservation, but it is automatically applied to the bill.\n\nAs for the food, it was amazing! It has genuinely been a while since I've left a restaurant feeling extremely satisfied and happy. We started off with a focaccia appetizer. The bread was a nice texture with a great spread pairing. I had the gnocchi, and my partner had the Monkfish special for our entrees. My Gnocchi was easy to eat, and had a nice flavor without it being overwhelming. The Monkfish was great too; the tomato-like sauce making it special. We ended the dinner with the Coconut for dessert: granola, topped with the lightest coconut gelato we've ever had, strawberry compote, and meringue.

Yes, the menu is small, but each dish feels curated and well mastered. I had the Kholrabi Salad (honeycrisp apple, hazelnuts, pecorino cheese) and the Tile Fish, which was served with the most delectable potatoes (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) and a delightful hollendaise-like sauce on top. My boyfriend wouldn't even let me try the chicken -- so it must have been perfect!\n\nOur drinks were excellent. I'm usually disappointed by restaurant cocktails but the Amer de Bonaparte and the Chanson D'Ete were on par with the city's best craft cocktail bars.\n\nWe each got an appetizer, entree, and two beverages.

Mind you, these were all listed as sides on the menu. They agreed. When the avocado arrived at our table it had chili oil drizzled all over.

Along with sweeping views of the lake and Streeterville from the restaurant's rooftop, the food was fantastic, particularly the house ricotta. I would have loved if they included just one additional piece of toast, which would have allowed for the perfect ratio between the amount of ricotta that was given and each piece of toast.

Really tasty topping for the bread, wish it was a larger portion. On the pork belly I think some people like the crispy top, it was a little much for me personally. It's filling, though. I wasn't really sure what to do with those beets on the plate, they didn't taste seasoned or anything so I just left them. Really interesting dessert - the apple brown betty. From the picture you wouldn't be able to tell there are small raisins in there! The cream was a little more acidic / citrus-y than I was expecting and the dish was served pretty hot, maybe a little too hot to eat immediately. Might have been good on a cold day outside!

We tried all of their signature cocktails on the happy hour menu. The ever so talented CAROLINA, who I believe is the restaurant's mixologist, suggested I try the beehive. It was AMAZING. I am a big fan of mezcal and was happy to see that they had a creation on the menu the included the smoky liquor. As we were wrapping up, we were brought a Negroni cotton candy that was very yummy. It drove us to order an actual dessert off the menu. We just had to get the smoked chocolate pot de cr\u00e9me that was so delicious.

And it isn't anywhere close to Sushi Ran prices. We are excited to have this in downtown and hope to eat here many more times!", "There's excitement in the air in Novato. Masa's is now helmed by the respected Chef Takatoshi Toshi formerly of Sushi Ran.  \n\nI came here to give the food a try, and had a great time.  I sampled the Salmon Citrus Roll (cucumber, avocado, and lime) and the Tamago (nigiri).  Both were delicious.\n\nThe highlight for me was tasting the Miso Black Cod (appetizer).  I recommend this small bite for a starter!", "My husband and I are sushi fans and go often and all over the bay area.  Masa and his wife run his place and offer fresh, consistent great sushi.  The place has a \"Cheers\" atmosphere.  If you go enough they get to know you and send you samples of things you might like and if you treat them nicely they will really make you feel at home.  It gets super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights so don't go and expect to sit down immediately without reserving a seat in advance.  I often do take out for dinner parties and among all my sushi loving friends the response is always resoundingly that it is great.  Try the Masa roll, steamed clams with sake broth when available and fried oysters wrapped in bacon.  Nigiri is always fresh and he does a nice white tuna roll.  We love Masa's!!!!!", "We have been coming to Masa's for many years for its fresh fish and friendly atmosphere in this  family owned and operated restaurant.  The wife Shoko always greets us warmly as Masa is behind the counter intensely concentrating on creating the best and freshest sushi available.\nTheir two sons help out at the restaurant in the evenings and on Saturday.  Coming to Masa's is like having dinner at a friend's house.  Quality of food and service is excellent and prices very reasonable.\n\nSad to read that they closed September 30, 2017.  Saw them before I went on vacation and didn't know they were planning to close their business.", "Just went here for the first time after the grand reopening about a month ago;  last weekend with my wife and old friends. Had to wait a little while make sure you make reservations. It's well worth the wait let me tell you. All the food was sooo fresh and absolutely amazing! The presentations were excellent and the wait staff is very friendly. We had a lot of food and drinks so unfortunately I cannot remember all the names of All the things we ate but I have a ton of pics the smoked fish was amazing, all the sushi we ordered was beyond fresh it was excellent. The ama ebi was to die for. The raw wagyu beef was amazing as well.\nTheir tap beer is very fresh also, they import kegs of Asahi directly from Japan!! It doesn't get any fresher than that. I can go on and on but just take a look at the pics and you will be drooling shortly.\nThe sushi chef/owner Taka was helping us and he even allowed me to make something up that was not on the menu, I asked him to smoke some raw wagyu! He then added some sliced truffle to the top of the nigiri which I believe grabbed the smoke flavor quicker. I hope this is added to the menu just ask for the Bob special hahahaha!", "Wow this place has changed. Long gone is the affordable masa's. Hadn't been here in several years and walked in today thinking it was a good deal for lunch. $24 bento lunch special - that's the price of the special sashimi deluxe platter I get in the city. Service was slow too.\n\n3 stars for food and the waitress was nice.", "Delicious and affordable. Had the Alaskan roll with smoked salmon (six pieces for $5.25) and an eel roll. Both were very good. Service was good. Nice location, easy parking, awesome atmosphere.", "Outstanding sushi. Equally outstanding staff. Our server Flavio carefully listened when I explained my wife's serious gluten allergy. And he got it. He verified our selections with the chef / owner. Later, the manager visited our table to check on us. This restaurant sets the bar very high in so many aspects.\nLocal friends recommended Masa's - and we quickly understood why.\nCan't wait to return. The whole staff appeared alert and highly competent. If you get Flavio as your server, you're guaranteed excellent service!", "Amazing sushi! We tried spicy tuna, dragon, dynamite, and crab avo. They were all so good! We came in on a Sunday afternoon for dinner without reservation, and were surprised to have gotten seated right away.

It's also the only one of the group where I've left completely full.  The food here is just on point though a bit rustic.\n\n(1). The chicken liver terrine was excellent, particularly with the oven hot slice of Brioche.  They even gave me an extra slice.  This is 5/5.  \n(2).  The gulf flounder gratinee with shrimp cream was a 5/5 for me. It's really quite French (and heavy). Everything about this dish was just perfect.  \n(3).  Palmier ice cream was a good dessert and had sweet, savory and texture components. The caramel made it a little too sweet for me. It's 4/5.\n\nI had a virgin mojito as my non-alcoholic pairing and it worked well. Service was great and the restaurant is gorgeous with a nice open kitchen in the middle.  Note that the check will already have the tax and tip included.  The above meal was $90. Not bad for a fantastic dinner in Hayes Valley. Overall, this is a 4.5 rating but I'm rounding up because of the fantastic service. Highly recommended!!!", "This was as good as the best I've had in Paris, France. We attended on New Year's Eve after watching a show.  They were the only place open.  What a find.  They gave their patrons free champagne, noisemakers and hats.  How festive.  The food was divine.  I had P\u00e2t\u00e9 De Foie Gras and bone marrow starters and my husband had the arctic char entr\u00e9e. The food was prepared to perfection and the bread was wonderful.  They even gave us extra bread at no charge.  We tried some desserts - a lemon tart and toffee ice cream.  I had a couple of bites of each and they were divine!  If you want to splurge by treating yourself with authentic French cuisine, this is the place to go!", "I went a few weeks ago for the first time and it was extremely tasty! Very clean, rich (but not too rich!) and well rounded flavors. We split the potato and leek croquettes and the poached shrimp. The croquettes were perfectly crispy on the outside and creamy, silky and just the right amount of salty on the inside. The shrimp were large and perfectly poached - I wasn't mad at the $4/per shrimp price tag at all ;) I had the artic char amandine with haricots verts, sunchoke and beurre noisette. It was fantastic - the almonds made for a delightful crunch and the fish was perfectly flakey and tender, the sunchoke added a delicate, earthy richness.\n\nI liked the clean decor of the restaurant. It was contemporary without being pretentious or sterile. It was simple but in a minimalist way that still felt inviting.\n\nI'd say the only downside was our server and the other supporting waitstaff, they were a little too attentive. They came by a little too often in my opinion. But then again if they came by too infrequently then that would be worse. This takeaway could also be due to the fact that a friend and I were trying to catch up and felt interrupted a bit. But not to overshadow the rest of the experience, it was otherwise fantastic!", "Food is just \"OK\" BUT overall in short this place is-\nPretentious.\nNot an intimate environment-very noisy with a large bar in the middle of the restaurant.\nService not truly warm/cordial.\nTook long time to get food.\nWaiter did not check  to see if food is ok until after we finished.\nWaiters dressed in jeans and sneakers under the apron.\nTable covered with paper over a tablecloth which gets messy and wet from cups of ice water.\nWaiter did not clean table from food crumbs before serving dessert. Had the dessert over a messy table.\nChairs uncomfortable-hard with small seat area.\nYou expect a bit more from a restaurant where you spend $180 on dinner for two.\nWouldn't you?", "And I said to myself: oh putain.\n\nLet's be honest, French restaurants in San Francisco usually range from mediocre to average. Monsieur Benjamin is way ahead of the pack.\n\nNice, refined and friendly yet not annoying wait staff. It's quite impressive for a place that's only been open for a few months.\n\nThe food is truly excellent, everything we had true French food and if there was a twist, it was modern and not stupid. Special mention for the pork ribs (which are not really a usual French cut) came out really well (maybe because they cook it for 12 hours?). While the wine selection is a bit short (and very French), they make up for it with a great beer and cocktail list. Keep some room for dessert because it's worth it, especially the Gateau Marjolaine and their novel Palmier Ice Cream.\n\nNow if only they could and did serve foie gras...\n\nThere is really not much to say because everything is spot on. Their French GM, Thomas is extremely nice and helpful and keeps everything in check, like a true professional.\n\nNow a tiny bit of advice: pommes sarladaises with the confit, more garlic in the escargots and maybe some sort of stew for winter time and you'll earn a 6th star.\n\nGood job guys!", "Let me put this straight - Monsieur Benjamin MB is worth the 6+ months wait. It's Corey Lee's second act after Benu. Appetizers did worry me a bit, yet entries totally sealed the deal. Looking forward to purchasing their serving plates!\n\nParking is always tough in that neighborhood, esp. with tons of restaurants and the Opera House in proximity. D\u00e9cor is by Aidlin Darling Design (Bar Agricole), kinda reminds me of Nojo. We got there @ 6:30pm yesterday (FRI) and it's already full house with two 2-seat left. Good vibe, causal yet elevated. Great service from both the GM and our server. A successful kitchen/restaurant does have their food & service under control even on its 3rd day of business.\n\nPrice is actually on the high end as a \"bistro\".  Considering it's tricky to present successful classic French dishes, I still highly recommend MB.\n\nBrunch service is upcoming and more walk-in seats will be available.\n\nEscargots were fresh, yet under seasoned. Skip the beignets. Fries were.......  fries. Luckily, the quail and duck confit + sausage dishes confirmed my wait was worthy.

The bread was not the typical lobster roll artisan bread, it was just a cheap roll, and the lobster was scant. The lobster was good but not memorable, very ordinary.

They've maintained a beautiful atmosphere during these crazy times and their service was still very good. Our waitress was great and we appreciated that she was very diligent about keeping her mask on correctly throughout the duration of our interactions. We started with the ceviche which was delicious. We then went for the grilled red snapper that was also super tasty. Our main was accompanied by the brussel sprouts which I could eat bowls of. Overall, great experience. My only complaint was it took quite a while to get our main--probably came out 30-40 minutes after our appetizer. Aside from that, a bit pricy but that can be expected when eating at the Del.

The dining room is a lush patio garden, charming but SO dark that the menu is unreadable without additional light, and one can't tell what's on the plate.

Some of the food was tasty - curried lentils delish, but fish, although cooked well, was served with rubbery skin. Any attempt at creative plating (desert--torn cake with chocolate ganache) was lost in the dark.", "Really good food and great value.  Great for sharing.  I'd recommend a party of 4 so everyone gets a bite of everything.  \nBuckwheat bread and butter is fresh and nutty but I wasn't super impressed with it.  Roasted broccolini with white chocolate - wow.  I was so pleasantly surprised by the flavor combination.  \nBurrata was great.  I couldn't figure out what was paired but it was full of flavor.\nPappardelle was fantastic, new to the menu . Must order again.  \nOctopus was fantastic.  Grilled and served with a some sort of bean paste that was subtle and didn't overwhelm the octopus.\nYellowtail collar was unique and presented itself as a finger food.  I enjoyed the Asian sweet seasoning.  I think mirin may have been applied.  \nBranzino with coconut milk was out of this world.  The flavor is so unique and tasty with hints of Asian basil in the reduction.  My favorite dish of the night.", "Wow wow wow!

Ordered the sourdough bread accompanied by very tasty yogurt! spread, plates of broccolini, beautifully cooked with a very slightly smoky undertone, then moved on to the quail appetizer, equally delicious. Continued with branzino - wonderfully prepared. Finished with a trio of desserts - the chocolate ganache and the divine roasted barley p\u00f4t-de-cr\u00e8me - it sounds strange but it's a beautiful cloud of sweetness balanced with fruity essence. Service was unobtrusive, the female sommelier was very helpful, and Michael McCarthy was the paterfamilias still greeting and charming the guests. We will absolutely return when in Santa Monica.", "The service was bad, and I'm an optimist. It starts off with us sitting down and being offered sparkling or still water, we ask for still.\n\nFrom there we ask about the Nashville hot calamari that we saw on yelp. We asked if it was something We could order being on the patio, the waiter said no, because we're in the dining room and the kitchen won't allow different foods in different areas. We order a cocktail each which were both nice.\n\nFor our order we get the bread, salad, pork collar, and the cavatelli. The salad and bread were alright, the cavetelli was worth ordering again, and the pork collar was delicious. With our entree we each get a glass of wine.\n\nThe problem I have is that I was bumped by the waiter and he didn't even look back to apologize. He had to have noticed he bumped my chair, it was pretty obvious. And then the worst part, the still water we selected appears as a NINE DOLLAR CHARGE AND THEY DIDNT EVEN LEAVE THE BOTTLE. OUR GLASS OF WATER EACH WORKS OUT TO BE $4.50. You should tell people people that they are being charged for water that is shared with the ENTIRE restaurant... it's ridiculous.

Yes you read that right, the best. They create the sauce from scratch using fresh tamarind juice, and what a world of difference this makes!\n\nThe tangy, thick sauce generously coats each strand without being too salty or overpowering. Combined with the head on, line-caught jumbo prawns, this \"Old School\" Pad Thai won me over with the depth of flavor, texture, and presentation.\n\nI was a fan of the rest of my lunch here as well!

The skin is perfectly crispy and the wings are just the right amount of spicy.\n\nThe Isan sausage was good but a little dry, which seems normal for Thai restaurants in the US. We would have loved the sausage with some green chili paste. It comes with jasmine rice by default so you should let them know you want it with sticky rice, which is the way it's normally served in Thailand.\n\nThe tom yum goong was great. It came with a generous serving of huge, beautiful shrimp. The inedible chunks of galangal, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves make it more authentic but I wish they had shelled the shrimp.\n\nWe can't wait to come back to try the homemade green curry and khao man gai... and have more chicken wings!", "My new favorite Thai spot in Berkeley.

Our server/host made us feel right at home when we walked into the quaint vibrant space. She asked if we'd ever dined in before and walked us throughout the menu.\n\nThere were so many great options, but my husband and I narrowed it down to these 3 items for lunch:\n- Fried egg salad: wow this was unique! 2 fried eggs under 2 grilled shrimp with a delicious Thai chili garlic and fish sauce.\n- Pad Thai: I've never seen such large shrimp on a pad Thai! It took a bit of work to take off the shell, but it was so worth it. It was so juicy and flavorful. The pad Thai was made just how I like my pad Thai and the noodles and tofu were cooked perfectly.\n- Pandan soft serve: uh, yes please. So creamy and smooth. And where else can you can pandan soft serve around here?!\n\nSo happy they have so many pescatarian options on the menu. I cant wait to go back.\n\nThey have a bunch of seating outside and a clean and vibrant restroom.\n\nService was super attentive throughout.

I got the Pad Thai Old Skool and shared some Party Wings and a Limeade with Butterfly Pea as well. Pad Thai was yummy and I'm glad they were able to make it non-spicy. I wasn't a huge fan of the shrimp because it had the shell and head still on, and the meat tasted pasty for some reason. I'm a complete wimp when it comes to spicy food, so the Party Wings were way too spicy for me. My mouth was burning, but at least I was able to get an entire wing down. The wings are super saucy so get some napkins ready if you're going to order this item. Limeade was good and the butterfly pea gave it a cool pop of color. Overall, Funky Elephant isn't the best Thai place I've been to, but it's still good. Wouldn't complain about coming back here as long as I get a non-spicy item.", "This was a surprise find. It's a teeny-tiny place, but it has big flavors. We tried the red curry with fish, shared the brussel sprouts and had to try the pad thai too. All of the dishes we had were fresh and flavorful. Each sauce, and seasoning seemed to pulse with it's own flavor. Nothing here tasted canned or dead to me. It was warm, vibrant, and the flavor really sings to you. The bathroom was funky, but in a good way.  The place was immaculately Clean.  And the service and hospitality was warm and friendly, like Thai restaurants should be.", "This intimate casual Thai spot in Berkeley is serving some of the most delicious authentic Thai food in the Bay Area.

The spicy, sweet and sour flavor are going to wake up your pallet for sure. Love the bright flavor of the Thai lime leaf on this dish. The pad Thai was perfectly chewy and came with two perfectly fried prawns. The kao mun gai was such a simple dish yet very satisfying. The chicken was moist and juicy and nicely served over the garlic and ginger scented rice. The Laotian sausage was not disappointing at all; two perfectly cooked house-made sausages served over a bed of aromatic herbs and thinly sliced Thai chilies. Finally, the delicious short ribs served with peanut sauce and Thai pickled cucumbers. The grilled short ribs were marinated with turmeric and coconut milk and tasted amazing!", "We stumbled upon this restaurant (kind of reminds me of the little strip malls in LA) by accident after a trip to REI.

The egg omelet was fluffy and there was a layer of jalape\u00f1os and onion and tomatoes that went so well with the cheese.

Just not good Indian food, butter chicken calzone was the only decent part, but it didn't wow me by any means. I tried the mushroom masala calzone and honestly it didn't taste Indian at all!

And the mejillones had a broth that is to die for. The main plates that we ordered (the barbacoa and the Cochinita Pibil) were large portions to share with your table. (Each can feed 2-3). While these dishes are not the best I've ever had, they came so very close. Can't find better in Chicago, that's what I'll bet on. The chile relleno was actually my favorite plate as the sauce carried the dish beautifully. I must add that the broccolini can't be missed.\n\nSo far, I've been here twice.

After getting a drink order he brought out 2 glasses of sparkling for each of us at the same time.  The Rose was completely flat. Not a single bubble. Pretty easy to tell with another flute sitting right next to it with lots of bubbles.  I've never been served 2 glasses at the same time. The fact that the server would even do that without clarifying is ridiculous.  We were also seated close to the server station and wow, this is my favorite part. Watched a manager awkwardly wander around the dining room while having his phone out the entire meal.  Didn't see him actually speak to anyone outside staff. Did watch him do nothing while 5 staff members were all packed I front of the same terminal joking around, hugging.\nIf I were an investor or had any stake in this place I'd be mortified after watching service.\nThere is no way on earth I would go back to any restaurant with service that poor at those prices.

All had complex flavors, but the squid was delectable!\nThe Cochinita Pibil was so tender and flavorful. The habanero salsa and black bean pur\u00e9e were outstanding and so flavorful.\nLastly, we had the Pumpkin for dessert. Wow! They shaped the dessert to look like an actual small pumpkin, and it was so delicious.\nChef Carlos G from Mexique has found his groove again in Tzuco!

The mussels are so fresh and cooked perfectly.  The spreads are so unique and complimentary while the breads are all made in house and super unique.  The tinga was so authentic I wanted more!  Further, the avocado flatbread was perfect with sweet and tangy and crunch.\n\nThe whole snapper was perfection!  It is a great size for two people.  The carne asada was generous too and that cheese dip is out of this world.

Wanted so badly to enjoy our meal here but very disappointed. We were seated at a high top near the bar with a nice view of the restaurant if we sat next to each other. Fine. But, there was absolutely no lightning. The hostess tried to compensate by bringing small candles over and apologized saying something about how there was a lighting mixup with the shipment and their fixtures had not arrived. Incredibly difficult to hear/understand our server due to the loudness, masks and thick accent. But, quality of the food was most disappointing. Ceviche appetizer was excellent. Octopus was tough and so saturated in sauce you couldn't enjoy any flavor. Crab sandwich was overly fried and piece had very little meat - all breading. Pibil was the worst.

The sausage on its own was great, and the topping on their own were great, but together the jam, currents and creme fraiche were too sweet and completely masked the flavour of the meat.

First of all let me give a big shout out to the management and staff as they certainly know what they are doing and everything was excellent.\n\nFor dinner I ordered (remember life is short) the 10 course mean which consists of\n\nTartare Cured Yolk, Bone Marrow, Shiso\nCaviar Uni, Dungeness Crab, Sorrel\nFoie Gras Green Lentils, Thyme\nGrilled Celtuce Green Almonds, Avocado, Black Sesame\nOcean Trout Pumpernickel, Smoked Roe\nRavioli Nettles, Fava Beans, Pistachios\nDuck Ramp, English Pea, Pinenut\nWagyu Pastrami, Carrot, Potato\nArtichoke Lemon, Honey\nRhubarb Fromage Blanc, Olives\n\nI also opted for the supplement menu\n\nNew York Strip Wagyu 12oz Blackmore Farms\n\nThe steak was cooked to perfection.  I also really enjoyed the dungeness crab and the duck.  The pacing in between courses was perfect as we never felt pushed nor had to wait to the next course.  Everything was warm and cooked perfectly.  I really enjoyed the wide range of selection of food that you get as well.\n\nFive Stars for the atmosphere, service, and the amazing food!", "Curtis stone does it again and this time with his brother Luke.  This meat centric restaurant is one of the most stylish restaurants in LA.  He food of course is second to none with an emphasis on meat whether it is grilled or smoke; the quality of the meat is amazing. Gwen also offers a butcher shop where it has amazing charcuterie, pate and steaks.  Tasting menu will not leave you hungry and the 95 dollar price tag is a bargain! I would definitely come here again. Curtis Stone is owning LA right now and is pure genius.", "Quick late lunch. What a treasure. Salami and brie sandwich with cafe Americano. Pay at the counter and they bring to your table.   Yummm.  The bread is fantastic.  Salty touch on the crust.  Salami is outstanding.  And the brie properly aged.\n\nThe design is so interesting.  A cross between vintage art-deco and industrial chic.  Works for me.\nI will save 5 stars for a dinner review.\nThe aging butchered meat does hang w/in view of the dining room. So if you are squeamish about aging dead carcasses you'll want to take your lunch to go.  \nProbably the only place in Hollywood where aging is allowed\n..haha!", "How do I say it without sounding so gushing? Yum. I went to Gwen to find some ideas for New Years eve BBQ.  Originally was thinking about more hanger steak as I invited more friends around.\nAsked the butcher what he thought was the most tender cut of meat and he suggested cap of rib eye. Gave me a rundown of the cut, where it is from, why it is a tough cut to find, and ideas for cooking it.\nHe was absolutely right and my new years eve dinner was a huge success.\nHe also showed me a lot of the other products they sell and appreciated his passion for all of their products. Pricey but worth paying a premium for such great products. Meat, cheese and other foods are all top notch.", "The food quality was incredible and execution was excellent. Bread & home made butter, Charcuterie, ceviche, foie gras torchon and 30 day dry aged Bone in Ribeye all so good.......service very good.\nThe counter looking into the kitchen I will definitely do next time.

However, I decided to try Spoon and Fork because my cousin recommended it.  I'm glad I tried it. We were a party of 2 and we shared the adobo belly nigiri, patita, and the lechon kawali.  I thought all dishes tasted delicious.  The patita  skin had the perfect crisp and the meat was tender and fell off the bone so easily.  I wish the patita automatically came with and egg and garlic rice, but you can always add it.  Definitely ask for the side sauces - a vinegar and chili sauce.  Also, definitely do not eat beforehand.  I would recommend not eating meat for a good day or two, because you will definitely get your meat fill here.  Also, leave room for dessert, because Frankielucy is across the street, and the only way to end a meal at Spoon and Pork is with a Filipino-inspired dessert from Frankielucy.  If I ever go back to Spoon and Pork, I will probably get the patita again, but add 2 eggs and garlic rice!\n\nPS - you can park in the lot with the Mexican restaurant.", "Filipino comfort food at its best. Come prepared for a great cooler weather meal with Spoon & Pork's hearty, tasty dishes. I got the Patita, a slow cooked then deep fried pork shank served over rice (added an egg). This dish was highly recommended by the staff (yes, it also happens to be the priciest dish). That said, although it was definitely a heavier meal for the average person, I could've eaten another 5 of them on the spot. This dish was AMAZING- the crispy outside gave an awesome crunch and the slow cooked pork on the interior was fall off the bone tender. The flavors all worked great and the rice was an awesome base to soak everything up.\n\nMy friend got the Lechon Kawali (deep fried pork belly) which was (not quite equally) great. Fun spot in the center of Sunset Boulevard in Silverlake, I'm shocked it's not a spot with a constant wait. The staff was super friendly and helpful in telling me about the dishes and the atmosphere they have makes it a nice choice for a casual date or dinner with friends.", "So my dad had suggested this place after hearing rave reviews from one of his friends. The location shares a parking lot with the Mexican restaurant next door and they have indoor and outdoor seating, which we opted for indoors.\n\nYou have to order food at the counter, but we definitely sat down to look over the menu to decide what to get. They were still in soft opening mode I believe, so the menu was limited, especially when they had run our of two dishes to serve (we had come around lunch time to eat there). They did not have a lot of drink choices either with only spring water, sparkling water and Mexican coke, which was the smaller size which I soon discovered...\n\nWe ended up getting food to split amongst us, so we got the banh mi type sandwich with pork belly, their version of the crispy pata, their other sandwich option and a dish with potato and meat topped with egg (totally can't remember the names of things lolz)\n\nHonestly, the service was great and the food was good, except for the overwhelming amount of salt that was on each dish, except for the pork belly one which became out overall favorite dish.", "Came here for dinner on a Friday night with some friends. This place was poppin and rightfully so. Food is very good. Everyone at our table was very pleased with what they ordered. Only gripe I had was the meat to rice ratio was a little off... I got the pork adobo and it was perfectly seasoned. I tried some of my bf's lechon and omg it was like eating a toasted pork marshmallow. Super crispy outside  but also soft and melt in your mouth in the inside.\nThe restaurant is cute and cozy. Service can be slow, especially on a busy night but that's because the same guy bringing out your order is also the same guy bussing them and taking orders in the front. Poor guy was doing like 20 jobs at once! We were in line just waiting to order our food for probably a good hr before sitting down to wait for our food to come out.", "Came here a while back since I had never been to a sit-down Filipino restaurant before, and the pun on their name really drew me in! So glad we came by here because everything we ordered was so delicious! Will definitely be keeping an eye out for other Filipino restaurants to try moving forward.\n\nWhen we stopped by, the inside seating area was booked out for a private event/party, so only the outdoor dining area was available for seating. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long. I'd recommend any of the dishes I ordered below since they were all amazing.\n\nIt's a bit out of the way for me to come back, but if I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely want to stop by again.", "After seeing all the rave about this place on a couple food blogs, I was excited to try this place.\n\nI finally went when I had a day off on a Wednesday and got the adobo pork belly. Thoroughly enjoyed it! The pork belly was marinated well and was cooked perfectly. Enjoyed the combination of the fried egg, tomatoes, and some sprouts. Very hearty and delicious. Strangely enough, I was still a bit hungry after so wished the portions were a bit bigger.

For entrees, we got the char siu fried rice, short rib kare kare and the pork ragu and we got the Tom yum mushrooms and broccolini for sides.

That was something I've literally never encountered at any decent restaurant. Pleasantly surprised is an understatement!\n\nThe one caveat to the place is that it's WAY too small for my liking. Having lived in NYC for over 10 years, trust me when I say I've been in my fair share of small spaces...but this one was just a bit TOO cozy. For starters, you have to wait for your table outside. Since I came on a summer evening, this wasn't a problem. However, if it were raining, snowing or too cold to be outside my friends and I would have found another place.

If you like octopus, their octopus salad (a \"special\" but it always seems to be available) is simply the best.  Today I had their porchetta crostini and they were luscious.  And the shrimp pesto risotto (also a frequently offered special) was absolutely superb--so creamy, but not mushy.  Regularly offered pastas--the pappardelle with wild boar sauce and the fettucine with wild mushrooms especially--are all excellent. The place is small, but doesn't feel cramped, and the service is always warm and personable.  But most remarkable of all are the prices: all the small plates are $11 (and the word \"small\" is deceptive--the crostini were practically enough for lunch all by themselves), and all the pastas are $12.  They also have a great selection of wines by the glass at pretty reasonable prices.  I almost always have something critical to say, even about excellent restaurants, but I have nothing but praise for Cotenna.  It's a perfect little jewel on a lovely side street in the Village.", "Absolutely charming! I've been twice and I'll be back for more.\n\nThe ambiance is fantastic and the space is cozy.

Mid-priced (eg $30 pp in a group of 5). Pro tip: Cotenna has a sister restaurant called Codino which is the same food but less of a wait, so I'd recommend there if the elusive Cotenna rez escapes you.\n\nI've gone here multiple times with a big group of colleagues as well as well as with a friend. I'll say that big groups get way more attention, though service is overall not very attentive. On the other hand, our waiter barely acknowledged us when I came with just one friend, and we got virtually no attention after placing our order.\n\nThings that are delicious here:\n\n- Clam vongole: The clam to pasta ratio on this is amazing\n- Truffle mac and cheese: Heavy on oil, but deliciously cheesy and truffley\n- Carciofi e olive: So tender, a little oily but flavorful. But I'm biased bc I love artichokes.\n\nThings that are fine - mostly salads:\n- Beet and goat cheese salad - exactly what it sounds like, not particularly  innovative\n- Mozzarella pomodoro - same as above", "Food and price are excellent, but as in most restaurants crammed into a small space, the service is slow. Great choice if you're looking for a night of leisurely drinking and fairly priced, delicious pasta. Osso bucco for $14? Come on, that's crazy talk.\n\nAt 8pm on a Monday, the place is packed. Arrive early to get a seat if you're more than 1 or 2 people. Decor and ambiance are great and very intimate, and most of the light you'll get passed 8pm will be by candlelight. Only flaw I experienced (besides the cramped space and slow service) was that I was offered a taste of a glass of wine, and then charged for a glass. There's only two people working front of house so I'm giving them benefit of the doubt.\n\nBottom line, I would return if I needed an inexpensive but nice Italian spot in the West Village.", "The most reliable Italian restaurant I have found in the city. Looking for an intimate, affordable wine bar with memorable food? You've found it here.

Waiters are very knowledgeable about wine recommendations. On my most recent visit, we shared 3 pasta dishes.

I don't eat shellfish or pork so the menu was a little rough for me, but I got the half-chicken dish and it was SO GOOD. The chicken and the veggies it came with were delicious, and I ate every little bit. Just FYI, they have a vegetarian platter but it's not great for the price (almost twenty bucks for rice, beans, fried banana, and another vegetable or two...come on!).\n\nThe drinks were also really strong, and we all loved our caiparinhas.

Not somewhere I would go every night, but it was great for a birthday dinner!", "Typical West Village - small, impossible to get a table...bird d\u00e9cor on menu.  You may find that appearance-wise, this restaurant blends in with the other holes in the wall.  But I assure you, Casa's Brazilian menu satisfies!  \nEntrees are very filling - I got the lean Pork Chop with sauteed bananas and collard greens.  You can order some sopas, but you won't be able to eat your entree.  Don't expect to finish all the food on your plate in one sitting.\nAs for the wine list, amazing!  The Pinot Blanc from Alsace (2005) was extremely memorable - with that ever so slightly fizzy, mineral flavor.", "An amazing restaurant with exquisite food and a fantastic owner and staff. However, this small space is not conducive to loud voices. I have had two meals ruined by people scream/talking. It is bizarre as the music is never loud. There is nothing one was to shout over. My hard of hearing father had to pull out his hearing aid last night as the table next to him had one fool in particular who must have thought himself so witty that he should shout/talk loud enough for the whole place to hear him. This is the second time I have experienced this here. We finally asked a waiter towards the end of our meal to intervene which he kindly and professionally did. I just wish the near-perfect staff would police loud patrons without our having to ask (the entire dining room was glaring at this guy) The food: everything here is worth trying. Great wine. My fave: the shrimp cake and stroganoff. Feijaoda also UNREAL. Also lots of celebs come here so if u enjoy star gazing, this is a good spot...jst be sure to give them their privacy!", "Dinner with colleagues on a rainy summer evening.\n\nOne word of praise: fulfilling\nOne word of caution: heavy\n\n- Drinks: Caipirinhas for sure! I loved the passion fruit color, but went for a lime one instead, on the sweeter side.  \n\n- Appetizers: POR\u00c7\u00c3O DE PASTEIZINHOS (empanadas) and the croquettes. Both came in 3 flavors each so the table can choose their own favorites.\n\n- Main dish: MOQUECA DE FRUTOS DO MAR (Bahia's seafood stew) served with farofa (corn flour) and rice. The coconut sauce is memorable, rich and sweet, just the right amount to stand out itself yet not to cover up the original texture and flavor of the seafood mix. Portion of the seafood is a bit less than expected though.\n\n- Desserts: Our waiter recommended the coconut pudding, way too sweet for my taste but the texture is consistent and portion is exactly right.\n\nAbsolutely recommend making reservations in advance. Ambience and service impeccable.", "A really good friend of mine who happens to be Brazilian took me here a few years ago and I totally fell in love. One of those adorable, quaint village spots that happens to have fantastic food, reasonable prices, huge portions, good service, strong cocktails, and lace doily placemats. What else could you ask for?\n\nI have had tons of stuff here, but the recommendations are:\n\n-Lime and mint Caipirinhas\n-Little cheese bread ball things\n-the empananada type pasty appetizers\n-Pincanha steak with the ammmmazing farofa\n-Grilled fish with fried banana and zucchini\n-Fajouda (I think they used to have it just on weekends, now I think they have it all the time)-if you like meat and beans-you have to try this. Its essentially a huge bowl of black beans with chunks of all different types of meat (don't ask questions, just eat it) with rice, farofa, orange slices, etc. Amazing.\n\nI have yet to have something there that wasn't great or brought someone there that didn't love it. Go go go.", "cute little restaurant hidden in the middle of the west village, Casa is a small quaint restaurant that has pretty good service and descent food. Considering the area, the foo dis somewhat reasonable. We started off with some appetizers,\n\n*Yucca fries that were qutie tasty\n*Shrimp loaf thing that was very flavorful but looked like a frickin meatloaf\n*Calamari which was fried perfectly, without a lot of batter which was awesome\n\nFor dinner, most of us chose the safe route of Pichana, which was not bad, it was cooked perfectly and tender, however the spices were a little bit off. Not a bad piece of steak for $18.  The pico de gallo was too salty and there was too much of that bredcrumb/yucca dust crap. Not a fan. Tastes like bacon bits.... would have been better if they offered some plantains or somethin.\nAnyway, cute place, worth checking out, but not somehwere I would go often.", "First time having authentic Brazilian food aside from your commercialized Churrascarias.

The windowed room is mod and minimalist, allowing the artistry of the Mediterranean-influenced menu to shine brightly at each table. Italian elements too find their way into many seasonal dishes, thanks to this rather versatile kitchen team. Charred tomato cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche lends luxurious smokiness and a tart flavor to tender chicken Milanese resting on a roasted cipollini pur\u00e9e.

We enjoyed an impeccable potato puree soup, butternut squash ravioli with spicy sausage, and the divine chocolate semi-freddo with Spanish nougat and salted caramel.  All courses were light and perfectly portioned, providing the ideal energy for a tour of the galleries in the modern wing without the heaviness often associated with a restaurant meal.\n\nIn short, no visit to the Art Institute is complete without a visit to Terzo Piano.\n\nThe wine list is small, but well-chosen.  In addition to the lighter varietals (sparkling, white, and an excellent rose from Province), the selection is heavy on some excellent unusual choices -- earthy, old world varietals from the Rhone Valley and Spain, including, to my surprise, a Cote Rotie.  Whether you go on the high end or the low end, the choices, combined with the heartier dishes on the menu, makes Terzo Piano an excellent option for a dinner date, as well.", "We came for lunch on a Saturday and the food was delicious! The portions are small and a little pricy, but make sense for the area and quality of food you're getting. I had the spaghetti neri alla chitarra, so delicious! My boyfriend had the chicken and it was gone before I could try a bite; he had nothing but good things to say. We topped of lunch by splitting the gelato. I recommend this if you're in the area or exploring the museum, members also get 10% off.", "My partner and I visited Terzo Piano for lunch.\n\nWe decided to sit outside on their nicely covered patio overlooking Millennium Park, and the surrounding skyscrapers of downtown Chicago. There are so many eye catching vistas to take in given its top floor location in the new Modern Wing of the Art Institute of Chicago\n\nThe minimal restaurant design by Renzo Piano is really wonderfully done. A 'white on white on white' theme runs throughout the restaurant space that really shows off the surrounding blue sky.\n\nThe healthy, Mediterranean-influenced cuisine is really simple, the service the same, and there are many affordable bottles of wine to choose from. Great luncheon spot, that's for sure.", "This restaurant is fairly expensive. However, the room has a minimalist vibe and is surrounded in floor to ceiling windows that allow sunlight to flood the room. It is a classy place for a business lunch or to bring your parents. The menu uses Italian cuisine as a jumping off point. I tried the flatbread pizza with shrimp and bacon and the margherita pizza. Both were solid offerings. I also had a salad made with pea shoots and pea tendrils. The surprise of the meal was the freshly made bay leaf soda. It was sweet and the bay leaf flavor was not overpowering. I really enjoyed the entire experience.", "Holy moly, who would have thought food at a Cafe in a museum could be spectacular?\nMy wife and I had lunch here on Friday and food was amazing. I started with some of their pumpkin ginger soup, with a nice thick schmear of cranberry jam, it was over the top delicious. My wife enjoyed a nice light pear and endive salad with a citrus vinegarret, gorgonzola crumbles and toasted hazelnuts, also very tasty. For entr\u00e9es I had roasted chicken with acorn squash and pomegranate seeds. The chicken was plentiful, tender and juicy and the squash was perfectly cooked with a light maple glaze while the pomegranate added a nice tart counterpoint. My wife's safron papardelle pasta with lamb ragu was the most amazing thing though. The safron flavor in the pasta was crazylicious, and the lamb ragu was a nice simple lamb and sofrito sauce. A nice bottle or Oregon pinot noir tied it all together nicely. Service was great too. I highly recommend this place if you are at, or even in the area of the museum for a spectacular meal.", "I had the entree, seared duck breast with smoked eggplant, tomato and white bean pur\u00e9e. Great taste and balance. Beautifully plated.

So rich and savory, accompanied by a tasty salad generously topped with freshly shaved cheese.  Generously portioned and very filling.\n\nThe salmon was cooked rare as requested, a bit on the sparse side, but seasoned well.

I don't think I've ever met a honey walnut shrimp I didn't like.\n\nOur roommate got the vegetarian dumplings which were also good.

Sesame sauce bean noodles & cucumber cold dish - they put horseradish / wasabi in the sauce, so if you don't like the feeling of clearing your sinuses over and over, this isn't for you!\n4. Tofu, pork belly, clear noodle soup: lighter bone broth soup. In my opinion, the best soup option on the menu. Other options include hot & sour & egg drop tomato\n\nThe woman who owns the store is super sweet - she frequently throw in a free app for us when we go - usually the cold potato strips.

The dips, bread and vegetables were adequate.  We enjoyed the kampachi as well, however, a tiny portion.  The ravioli was good, but also a tiny portion.  The main entree and dessert were major disappointments.  The swordfish lacked flavor and interest which was served with a horrible cold broccolini.  The dessert was a joke.  If you're trying to elevate the SD dining experience, you have to do a much better job at quality of food for your feast and a la carte.  The food appearance was nice, but it has to taste good with complexity with spices and textures.   The service was attentive but the server needed to explain the feast in more detail.  It was not a feast.  (Take a look at Galit in Chicago and what they offer).  We travel the world and know great restaurants.  Sorry- this is not one of them.", "Let's just say I get the hype.

Exceptional preparation.  The clams were a bit chewy (Chef  Travis acknowledged it - no worries).\n\n- Aleppo Chicken:  ordering chicken at a restaurant can be an exercise in mediocrity.

A refreshing green ice tea with jalape\u00f1o, cucumbers, lemon and mint to cleanse the palate on a hot summer's day. For appetizers we had the bacon wrapped dates. I don't think I've had bad bacon wrapped dates. It just not possible! Perfect bite of sweetness and saltiness to get the engines going. For entrees, we split the braised short rib sandwich with fries on the side and the Spanish style chicken. Both dishes were excellent.

The experience was extremely disappointing and consistent with other recent visits. It begins with a hostess who is overly focused on multi-tasking and does not pause long enough to be at all welcoming. Next, one is seated at a cheap, faux wood table that is equally suited to a banquet hall or cafeteria. There is nothing on the table - candle, flower, etc. -- to distract from the plastic laminate. The service is pleasant but amateurish, having not an in-depth understanding of the menu, kitchen's capabilities, or wine list.  The food, which was laudable when the restaurant first opened at its former location, seems now tired, un-innovative and dated. Moreover, it is uniformly greasy. So enamored is the kitchen with oil (and grease) that in response to my request for any vegetable or grain that could be prepared without oil (a medical restriction), I was offered steamed carrots and steamed lettuce - that is apparently all \"chef\" (as the waitress generously referred to him) was capable of making.

The presentation gets two thumbs up -- the toppings were assembled neatly and the colors so vibrant and appetizing. The taste? Incredible! The crust was thin and crisp as a cracker. The tomato sauce tasted so fresh and rich! I'd be satisfied with a pie just with this sauce but the vodka sauce and pesto allowed for different pockets of explosive flavor with each bite. Mmmmm. They skimped on the mushrooms, though. Anyways, I'd order this pie again. I ate 3 slices but could honestly have eaten the whole thing by myself.

The ingredients are always fresh and flavorful.\n\nNot only does Rubirosa have gf pizza, but they have an entire gluten free menu. They offer some amazing pasta dishes, rice balls, and even mozzarella sticks.

Rubirosa serves up some great pizza and it's supposedly a 50 year old recipe. You won't find any creative and funky fusion type pizzas here. It's just good old fashioned NY style toppings like fresh mozzarella, basil, tomato and sausage.\n\nTheir handmade pasta is also very good. I highly recommend the carbonara - it's made with pancetta, onions, poached egg and tons of parmesan cheese. The pasta has a great bouncy texture that melts in your mouth.\n\nRubirosa is has a nice rustic environment. It's cozy and intimate - perfect for a date. Like most NY restaurants, it's small, so there can be a wait during peak dinner hours.", "Rubirosa is one of those long, narrow, dimly lit kind of NY restaurants, with a quaint historical feel to the building. It's a bit cramped between tables, so I'd recommend eating at the bar, where you get faster service anyway. At dinner time it takes at least 30 minutes for your pizza to appear on your table after being seated. I recommend the Tie Dye pizza, which has pesto and vodka sauce on it; super flavorful. This place also serves great lattes, although I may be the only person ever to pair a latte with pizza. We had a snippy hipster waitress the last time we dined here, but even her cold demeanor couldn't ruin a great meal. I'll definitely be back, albeit at the bar, though, to place my order with the friendly bartender.", "The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of how inefficiently they handle customers waiting to be seated. Bear in mind, we went in February, which was still pretty cold. The outside waiting area that's covered fits maybe about 10 people max without it feeling claustrophobic. Then, everyone starts to crowd inside and around the exit. I was practically leaning onto the customers sat around the bar, which I felt terrible for (both them and I). The customers next to the door also were surrounded by random people right next to and in front of their desks that I know I wouldn't have been able to enjoy my meal.\n\nAll that aside, I reserved a spot for 8 people on Resy prior. We still had to wait around 20 minutes upon arrival, but we were then taken to the back of the room and seated on a large table. Needless to say the food lived up to our expectations and more. The tie-dye pizza... I can understand the hype around it! There's something they add into their food here...\n\nTl;dr: food is amazing, waiting experience- not so much.", "We live in Maine but come to NYC every Christmas for the festivities.

For the mini rice bowl, you actually have a choice of the rice bowl with chicken, pork, or fish (Tuna or Salmon). The soup based or broth is really rich and the flavor is deep. I love it. The pork chasu is always the add on/topping that I personally need to have in any tonkotsu based ramen and their quality of chasu is very good.

It comes with a sesame miso broth, accompanied by artisan crafted noodles, then topped with broccolini, tofu, corn, bean sprouts, soy meat, baby kale, and chili oil.

Found a new place to take us together. Love it very much, your signature noodle bowl with black sesame is amazing. I'm in love with sesame and this confirms it even more so.\n\nFirst off this is near the airport and a lot of business buildings around the area. Parking is not very large in area but enough to get in where you want in this little plaza. Parking is limited to 90 minutes in this area so be careful and come when you know you won't have to wait too long.\n\nCustomer service is wonderful and easy going here. They have outdoor dining and are using precautions for the ongoing pandemic. Nobody goes inside and the outdoor area is smaller but able to have a good amount of customer space.\n\nPrice point is very good here, for all you get and eat. Amazing to find a space that has so many reviews and that has been around a while. For sure worth the prices they serve up with.\n\nWill be visiting once again and can't wait to come back to try more of your bowls, sides and noods.", "So. Stinkin'. Good!\n\nEverything was so delicious right down to the water they serve. I know what you're thinking, \"it's water... calm down...\" but no. It was lightly flavored with strawberry and mint. Crisp, cool, and immensely refreshing.\n\nThe pork buns were steamed to perfection. Light and fluffy bun with super yummy marinated pork belly inside.\n\nThe tonkotsu ramen was definitely the star of the meal. The rich and creamy pork bone broth was excellent. The grilled pork chashu was perfectly tender. Nothing was too salty. Not to mention they make their own artisan noodles. I had the house noodles, which are a little thicker than traditional ramen noodles but thinner than udon noodles, and they were truly excellent.\n\nService was fast and friendly.\n\nDefinitely a gem of Irvine."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/hironori-craft-ramen-irvine-3?hrid=OPESmvznFZkkC1YFa1djfA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hironori-craft-ramen-irvine-3?hrid=7sxIcb5Mfs19QSb3WIdkUg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hironori-craft-ramen-irvine-3?hrid=elYS1FfU71eQnNmElH82kw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hironori-craft-ramen-irvine-3?hrid=a5GOgyvSiEoSHlHJRdTvTg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hironori-craft-ramen-irvine-3?hrid=2v4GxIXG7mi0MFzJgdV7Ug&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hironori-craft-ramen-irvine-3?hrid=bQMX4JpWd_JPTH0bYWk3sA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Diavola", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/diavola-pizzeria-geyserville-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/geyserville/restaurant/diavola", "michelin_pov": "Its home in downtown Geyserville has a Wild West appeal, and the interior, festooned with statues of saints, boar tusks and stacks of cookbooks, has a playful yet smart vibe.

We shared the Cha Cha Cha pizza which was by far one of the best pizzas I've ever had. It has house smoked pork belly, roasted red peppers, goat cheese and scallions. Seriously good and we chowed down on this one. Also tried the Romana pizza which in theory should be my style, but missed the mark. This one has tomato, garlic, oregano, olives, capers, anchovies, Mozzarella di Bufala and Calabrian chiles. All things I LOVE, but the anchovy taste was super overwhelming and ruined this pizza for me. It had the right heat, but again, when you've got one ingredient that can overwhelm all other ingredients, that should be used sparingly.\n\nOverall, great service. Refills (and water!) were provided without asking and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I'll definitely be back!", "Without a doubt, 5 stars. Awesome, trendy yet casual vibe in the middle of wine country. The meat cured in house is phenomenal. And you cannot go wrong with the self-titled pizza. Topped with roasted red peppers, arugula, spicy Sicilian meatballs with pine nuts and raisins, this pizza is just insane! It gets even more ridiculous when paired with a glass of Acorn Sangiovese from a vineyard right down the street.

It's casual, yet cool and always a fun place to bring groups.\n\nHours - Open 7 days per week for lunch and dinner unlike a lot of places in Healdsburg/Sonoma.\n\nPrice - Pretty reasonable for the area as Pizzas and Pastas are $15-$18 while other entrees are more expensive. Again you get free corkage if you buy a bottle of wine at Diavola.\n\nI highly recommend this place especially if you're in the area.

But last time, we called in a to go pizza, we live next door so we walked down to pick it up. We stood in the crowded lobby for 20 minutes, and the girl on the phone said it would be 15. Our pizza was cold, and the meat was not cooked into the cheese, it was like nuked and thrown on there. And on top of it its 19$ for a simple pizza, which is about the size of a medium at most pizza places. We since moved to downtown and prefer papa murphy's take and bake over Diavola. I really think its the staff mostly, their understaffed and unorganized.\n\nI hope it improves because the idea is great..\n\nGood Luck, but we wont be back!", "I can't believe I forgot to write this review until now.\n\nCame the day after Thanksgiving when I went wine tasting with some friends.\n\nThe Wild Boar was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Ever.  I dreamt about it for the rest of the weekend.\n\nWe had several different apps, including a meat and cheese plate and the antipasti.  Others had the ravioli's and the Gnocchi which were loved as well as one of the pizza's.\n\nFriendly staff.  Great coffee as well!   Can't wait to come back. I'm a little sad to see that they've switched into a winter menu and don't have the boar right now, or the marrow app.  But look forward to trying their other delights!", "6 years later, and Diavola is still just as delightful as I remember! We love stopping here on the way up to Anderson Valley for pizza, salads and such. It's got big city hipster ambiance and an impressive artisanal menu, with a friendly small-town vibe.

With its hip, industrial d\u00e9cor, imposing exhaust fans over each table (a clear sign that there\u2019s a ton of grilling going on) and lively blend of sweet, spicy and sour flavors, dinner here promises to be a sensory explosion like no other.\nOne could feast on the abundant pre-meal banchan alone\u2014a stunning selection of kimchi, mirin-soaked fish cakes, sake-steamed black beans and more. But, that would mean missing out on delicate slices of sirloin bulgogi smothered in a sweet, gingery marinade; or restorative and spicy sundubu jjigae bubbling away in an iron pot.", "yelp_reviews": ["Was visiting Chicago with the family and wanted to take them for Korean BBQ- my teens haven't eaten a lot of Korean food. I was looking for a place that would be low stress after a long day of museums and walking, so I chose Gogi after reading about the great service. And because they had parking, that was a big plus for my spouse.\n\nWell, the service WAS great- so kind and helpful. And the galbi was SO good. Lots of banchan and all of it good- and a good variety. Spouse and I loved the kimchi and spicy pickled daikon. I loved the odeng... so tender and delicate flavor. We also loved the bean paste... they said it was one of their specialties.\n\nOne of my teens - not normally super adventurous - tried every single thing on the table and declared each thing somewhere between \"fine\" and \"delicious\" which is seriously high praise. My other teen was really exhausted and just quietly and happily chowed down on the galbi, bul go gi, japchae, and mandu.\n\nI wish we had ordered the seafood pajeon- another table had ordered it and it looked great. Also, it was HUGE!", "I don't usually make yelp reviews but Gogi has to be an exception. The food here is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, best Korean BBQ I've had in the city. They're the only place in chicago I know of that prepares pork BBQ (samgyupsal) in thick cuts versus thin slices. Their beef short ribs (kalbi) is juicy and marinated to perfection. The staff was extremely hospitable and gave us a soup and egg (gaeran jjim) dish on the house. You can tell their ox tail soup doesn't have exorbitant amounts of MSG added to the stew, it tasted so natural and refreshing. I would definitely come back here again, especially considering it's open til 4 am on Saturday nights and there's a karaoke place next door that also closes at 4 am. This place was absolute perfection!", "I'm not going to comment on the food, since my date and I are not familiar with Korean cooking. However I will say that we did not enjoy it.\n\nMy real concern with Gogi was that this place is a pigsty. I doubt if it has had a decent cleaning, in years. To make it worse, there is no decent air lock to separate the inside of the restaurant from the outside weather. At this time of year we could only tolerate this cold restaurant by wearing our coats while dining.\n\nThe men's room is filthy. There's a posted sign that says employees must wash their hands before returning to work. I say, \"Why bother. The restaurant is already a polluted mess.\n\nThe restaurant was highlighted on a local food show, last night. So they were busy all day today. Sometime, during the day, they ran out of soft drinks. So one might think, send someone over to the local grocery and pick up some more. But no, that was too much for management to deal with. Instead, they spent the night serving water, like it or not.\n\nI am ashamed of myself for having tolerated this place and for having stayed for the meal. I promise, I won't make this mistake again.\n\nM", "Stopped by in here on a whim, just me and my dad.  Just looking around, the place was busy, always a good sign.  Luckily there was an open table so we were seated right away(Apparently this is a rare occurrence and we were encouraged to call ahead next time).  We had the bulgogi and samgyeopsal, both of which were excellent, and came with a ton of banchan.  The servers were a little chaotic but very friendly, which was understandable as they haven't been open for very long and were still working on training staff.  All in all, a must repeat experience; I can't wait to go with a bunch of people.  Plus, we got a voucher for the bar/restaurant place next door, which apparently is their sister restaurant.", "This must be the best Korean BBQ in Chicago with respect to both value and quality! Their pork is very great unlike other BBQ uses pre-flavored pork to cover the bloody taste. They did their own way to produce the raw pork, which is fresh but not smelling. When they cook it, they use a large iron plate which dissipate the heat evenly to the pork. It definitely makes the pork less fat and more crispy. We also tried their beef slices. Due to the good cooking stuff, it's also amazing.\nAdditionally, if you order certain kinds of meat, you will get free kimchi fried rice. My GF likes it extremely,  because she is a huge fan of kimchi. I have to say when I checked, I was shocked by the bill. You get countless side dishes and good quality meat as two entries with only less than $50. Really good place for dating of young couples!", "Excellent dinner on a visit to Chicago. The thinly slides beef brisket and the spicy bulgogi pork were delicious as was the fried rice. Steamed dumplings also very good. Massive amount of small side accompaniments were nice such as the radishes, black beans were chewy good, kimchi, etc. wine prices seem a little high but can get 60 oz bottles of Korean beer for $13 so hard to beat that. Beer goes better with spicy Korean anyway. Service was friendly, on the spot and a nice touch of humor. It was not overly crowded on a Saturday evening but it was cold out and imagine a lot of holiday parties going on. I understand they are usually crowded. I only rated down a notch for the ambiance-lights were pretty bright and not very calming.", "Galbi barbeque -- sweet marinated beef that is grilled in front of you. Glorious.

The ambiance is nice, service is good, and if the veggie options were pretty tasty, I am sure the meat options are, as well.", "The extensive menu has its ups and downs, but the good ones are really good: for example, the oxtails are rich and flavorful, the spinach with pine nuts and raisins made me realize how good spinach can really be, the grilled pork sausage with white bean puree and parsley salad was good and the carpaccio was the best I've ever tasted (I had ordered \"gazpacho\" and the waiter thought I said \"carpaccio\", and I'm glad he did!), and I really enjoyed the agreeable smoky elote.  The \"tarta de queso\" has been better some times than others.  \n\nI did not care for the \"Canelon de Pollo Ahumado\" (smoked chicken cannelloni, foie gras sauce, and a sherry reduction) which tasted to me of truffle oil, nor did I especially like the gazpacho, my favorite soup but which here was a bit vinegary for my taste.  \n\nIf you sit at the bar, as I did once, you run into the possibility of sitting with celebrity chef Amar Santana, who'd been a runner-up on \"Top Chef\".  \n\nI love the \"Vaca Tonic\"!", "I do not visit SoCal often, but when I do, I definitely try to visit new places to dine and have cocktails.

We selected a multitude of tapas that included braised oxtail, pork belly, smoked chicken cannelloni, octopus, shrimp ceviche, and seared tuna.

The vibe was lively and romantic, with the dark lighting and amazing smells coming from the kitchen. Our server was fantastic, with excellent recommendations for tapas, wine pairings, and entrees. She gave us samples of the wines and a very generous pour of the ones we selected. For our starting tapas we had the Vieiras a la Plancha (seared scallops) and Canelon de Pollo which were both delicious. Then, for the main we had the aged rib eye steak (so worth it!) with more tapas of Bruselas and Patatas Bravas, paired with two different types of Spanish red wine. Such amazing flavor combinations!

My one complaint is they were a bit sparse with the basil, as I would've preferred more on my pie. Otherwise, a nearly perfect rendition.\n\nOverall, terrific service, great pie and a killer fried chicken app makes this one of the better places I've eaten at in SF.

Its good but I just like my pizza with more sauce than that.\n\nI loved the Pims punch- the punch bowl is HUGE.

The ambiance of this place was on a whole different level! This is perfect for a date night or even birthday dinner with friends. The food is FANTASTIC! I highly recommend getting their Elea chips. If you are a muncher you will love this on top of their hummus/spreads with their pita bread. I got the seafood orzotto (rice dish) and it was so fresh and filling.

After reading great reviews about the octopus dish here, I had to try it for myself. That ended up being a great choice, as the octopus was possibly the best I've ever had. While most octopus is rather chewy (in a bad way), this octopus was super tender and easy to bite into. Also, the shallots and capers complimented the octopus nicely, adding some sweetness to the dish. The fava (bean paste) underneath was a great way to round out the dish by adding a creamy texture. My one complaint about this dish was the somewhat small portion size for $24.\n\nThe restaurant itself is decorated to have a light, open Greek island kind of vibe while maintaining a classy atmosphere. There is a nice outdoor dining area in front of the restaurant in addition to the indoor seating. The staff are friendly and the service speed was pretty fast.\n\nOverall, El\u00e9a is one of the best Greek places that I've had, taking everything into account.

We had greek salad, fish, spinach, and lemon potatoes.  All very good with the exception of the fish which was not explained properly. It could have been cooked more and we did send it back but that wasn't my issue.\nWe asked if we can share a fish and was told \"yes, its large enough for two. However, the fish was way too large and we couldn't even finish it. It was also $140 for the fish which was not worth it. The server should have done a better job explaining how large this fish was going to be and gave us an estimate since $140 just for a fish for two seems high priced. I looked at the table next to us and they had just regular size branzino which I would have preferred and not wasted.

Of course, when I saw the piggy custard buns I had to get them - my snapchats got people asking me where I ate! The shrimp dumplings (har gao) weren't as fresh but the pork shu mai were pretty good!

Dim Sum is all about the carts, the crowd, sounds and smell and they certainly deliver it here in the vast 3 floors. The service is usually typical of Chinese restaurants with a slightly friendlier and accommodating staff. The Dim Sum is still of good quality, price and selection for the most part.\n\nI've also seen the place change over quite a lot. Before more locals but lately it is more tourist and non-Asian. This has affected and reflected the Dim Sum selection to more Plain Jane and Joe Six pack and less 'exotic' dishes like they had before. Thankfully, some staple like tripe with turnip and chicken feet remain but it seems more for the entertainment of the non Asian customers.  \n\nSo sadly my rule of thumb is I generally avoid Asian(Chinese) Restaurants with more blonde heads than black I avoid.

There's an \"Old School\" side of the menu, which offers American favorites, still creatively prepared (ie. crab cakes).  The \"New School\" side is extremely innovative fair- hard to even wrap your mind around some of the flavors.\nThis is a solid go-to restaurant when you're in the South Bay, just for the fact that  you can always try something new.

Can't wait to visit in person with a group so that I can order everything I like and not have to decide what I'm eating one evening!\n\nPlenty of veg options, and all of the as delicious as the next, even when packed to go. Have tried the roti (fluffier than most that I've had), the spicy noodles (pleasantly spicy, and I don't have a high tolerance), kale tea leaf salad (the only type of salad I'll profess to enjoying--super flavorful and filling, although it looks like it'll be not enough when it comes), and the chickpea tofu (was not expecting it to come with a coconut curry sauce, and it's taking all my willpower not to eat all of it when I know that'll be way too much for one meal).\n\nDefinitely worth going to, especially if your experience with Burmese food starts and ends at Ruby Rangoon (guilty as charged).", "Burma superstar is the obvious competition, I happened to like Burma a little bit more. Pea shoot salad was good, the tea leaf salad was a tad bit shy on the crunchy stuff, the shrimp was memorable, the noodles with veggies was a little bland but still edible. Chicken wings were delicious but it took a while for someone to acknowledge me when I walked in though. I wouldn't return simply based on that because it's not like the servers didn't see me. I ordered to go so I think they probably thought I was a door dasher or something. I would much rather wait for my table at Burma superstar than to not be acknowledged upon entry to the establishment. Qualms about the food are the coconut rice was a little over cooked, noodles lacked flavor and the garnish of crunchy stuff was minimal. Pros are great coconut milk sauce with the shrimp, decent portion size on the salads but only like 6 medium sized shrimp for like $14. I would recommend the food but wasn't drawn to return.", "It's hard to compete with Burma Superstar down the road, but Teni East has quickly become my go to restaurant in Temescal. Teni is just as delicious, there is no wait, it has easy street parking and there's always kind servers/staff. I've been here countless times and I haven't tried something I didn't like.

We ordered:\nRoti starter $8 the best thing on the menu - crispy, buttery goodness\nTea leaf kale salad $9 - Good, tea leaves weren't too overwhelming and the raw baby kale was a nice alternative to the usual all cabbage tea leaf salad.\nLamb curry $13 - taste wise good, meat was tender, but a small meat portion for that price.\nCumin pork belly $13 - okay, kinda bland tasting. The pork belly cut reminded me of bulgogli.\nCoconut veggie curry $12 - also on the bland side. Menu states it comes with okra which is why we ordered this, but we found one piece of okra in the entire dish. Really disappointed.\nCoconut rice $3 - a little too sweet for me. It was like eating mango sticky rice sans mango and with fried garlic sprinkled on top.\n\nWas hoping for more flavor in some dishes and would love to see lunch specials (ex. Curry that comes with rice and a side of stir-fried veggies) offered.", "Sooooooo.....this is a take on Burmese food.\nIt's been gentrifryed a bit.

After several visits, the one word that comes to mind is consistency.  Peasant constantly hits the mark on good food and great service.

From the Sarde Al Forno (Sardines oven roasted with olive oil and bread crumbs) to the Malloreddus Con Bottarga (A form of pappardelle pasta) that is packed with flavor, it warms the heart and feeds the soul. The Porchetta Arrosto, (a rotisserie suckling pig), another favorite of mine, is served in layers and is beyond mouth watering.  Layers of creamy potatoes, seconded with sweet moist pieces of pig and topped with a crisp layer of both meat and skin; all while enjoying a nice glass of wine selected from a wine list that accommodates all.  If you still have room for dessert, you have to try a sicilian classic, the cassata with pistachio ice cream.\n\nGreat for couples or friends looking to enjoy each others company.\n\nPeasant is truly inspiring and I give big props to Chef Frank Di Carlo.", "Peasant was a great (random) find while walking around Nolita, from the mouthwatering food and the friendly service, to the charming osteria spirit.

She was even more accommodating by letting our group do a family style meal.  In the end we ordered 2 apps and 4 entrees, which we all got to partake in and  I would say the entrees are a bit more creative and tasty than the pastas, but everything is still good.  My favs were the special salad with chicory and anchovy dressing (I wanted to lick the plate when we were done) and the Agnello Con Polenta which was this wonderfully medium rare lamb flavored with rosemary over creamy polenta.\n\nOh and I forgot to mention how much I loved the pre app of fresh bread and ricotta cheese in wooden bowls and olive oil from Di Palo's right down the street.\n\n*Technically Peasant isn't in Lita, but I think its the best Italian in the area, so its worth the walk up, to come here.", "NoLita is a neighborhood that I wouldn't have set foot in once upon a time.

Try the Octopus, or the Grilled Calamari. If I lived nearby I would become a regular. Outdoor seating is a plus.", "Peasant's food is all about rusticity, dishes are presented simply, and the main ingredient is often unadorned.\n\nThe spicy octopus appetizer is incredible - it's a small octopus in a spicy, rich, delicate sauce. The razor clams special arrives perfectly grilled and accompanied only with a light breading.\n\nWe ordered the sausage-and-chestnut-stuffed quail over polenta and the porchetta with fingerling potatoes - both dishes were excellent. The quail was roasted perfectly and the stuffing did not overpower the quail's subtle flavor. The crispy skin from the porchetta was a delicious contrast to the juicy meat and herby potatoes.\n\nWe also tried the burrata app, it was so-so. The cheese was great but the \"wood-roasted\" tomatoes didn't impress us.\n\nShould the service in a place serving rustic dishes be equally uhh...simple? Maybe, but not for $30 an entree.\n\nWe waited for quite a while before putting a drink order in and didn't really get much warmth from our waitress. I guess it's a small point, but it's noticeable nonetheless.\n\nThe pizzas at Peasant are good, but I'd say go for the slightly more exotic choices, you won't find sucking pig, sweetbreads, quail, squab, skate, and venison so simply-but-expertly prepared anywhere else.", "A comfortable spot for comforting Italian fare.\n\nThe mushroom special appetizer is a savory treat not to be missed, but still falls short of the baby octopus (polpi in purgatorio).  Absolutely tender and marvelously prepared, it is guaranteed to make you forget all the gummy rubbery excuses for octopus you've ever been served in the past.\n\nI was eager to try the tagliolini with sea urchin.  Overall a tasty dish, but the garlic and general seasoning of the pasta overpowered the subtle bitter notes of the sea urchin when eaten together.  I felt like it did the sea urchin a disservice, but I still left my plate clean and with a smile on my face.  \n\nBig fan of the ricotta cheese they give you at the beginning of the meal with the bread - a light, fluffy, subtle delight.", "The ambience and service was great, but I was not impressed by the food.\n\nThe lobster risotto and panna cotta were the standouts of the meal.

For starters we got:\n-Palak Chaat: THIS - I could've had a huge portion of this for the entire meal and been content with my meal. It's the perfect balance of crispy with a nice bite. The chutneys and yogurt drizzled on top give this dish a tangy/spicy/sweet taste all at the same time. It's seriously SOOO good.\n-Sev Bhatata Puri: yummy but pretty standard\nFor dinner:\n-Chicken Green Masala & Paneer Tikka Masala: both were very delicious. Definitely tastier than most Indian restaurants, could've been a little on the spicier side but they gave us a spicy chutney which helped\n\nDefinitely worth going to this restaurant if you're in DC! I will be back ESPECIALLY for that palak chaat", "Went here for a late lunch after a morning touring the National Gallery of Art.  They offer a four course tasting menu even during the day which we ordered.  The Palak Chaat appetizer was outstanding. Flash fried spinach with a light delicious dressing.   Far better than the usual heavily battered stuff you get in lots of places.  Scallops with a very different tomato sauce with tamarind, followed by a selection of four different Indian main dishes (small amounts of each, of course). Butter chicken, lamb, lentils and a sweet and sour eggplant and potato dish.  All were very delicious.   We also had a couple of house signature cocktails that were yummy.\n\nThe food here is outstanding and the service matches. They even accommodated us arriving 30 minutes early even though they were very busy. If you like Indian cuisine, are a foodie, or want to impress a date, this is a great choice.", "I am about to gush over this place.  I tried it's six-course tasting menu.  It's famous palak chaat sent me to the moon upon first bite.  By the time the perfect black cod came out as the fourth course, I think I had blasted out of the solar system already.  Essentially I was full already by this time and perfectly content.  Then the HUGE main course came out with tasting bites of 5 entrees with basmati rice and naan.  Are you kidding me?  I just had to giggle.  I am a big eater.  This is crazy amount of food.  Packed most to go in order to anticipate dessert tasting plate.   Oddly, their chicken tikka Masala was a let down and a bit salty.  The grand slam of Indian desserts did not disappoint but lacked originality and one fried portion was absolutely grease drenched.   And so, the first four courses were full on incredible.  The last 2 courses really could be another meal on its own and didn't live up to the first four.  May Rasika consider the concept to the 5th and 6th courses and make them more focused.  Still, that palak chaat and black cod were epic.  EPIC.  I shall dream of them till I fly back to DC.", "crispy palak chaat was by far the highlight of the meal.. service could have been better .. our server did not inform us that the kitchen was going to close soon so we did not order all the food we needed only to later realise that the kitchen was *not* taking any more tickets... whatever we had was flavorful though .. the spicy reshmi kebab indeed lived upto its name almost to the extent that it became increasingly difficult to finish it thanks to the heavy spice and heat. We were glad we ordered the lassi to cut the spice of the kebab which was quite tasty (proper consistency and flavor). For the entree we could only taste the baingan bharta and tandoori chicken tikka, both were delectable. When we notified the manager about the service they at least had the courtesy to offer us complimentary desserts. We ordered the date and toffee pudding and blueberry kulfi with strawberry rabdi both of which were interesting desserts. I wish we had more time here to try out their menu .. it just felt very rushed given that we had arrived pretty late for lunch .. Definitely a place worth visiting again .. hopefully the next time I pay a visit to DC !", "Great experience overall. Most of the dishes were good but spicy and salty. The sauces were really rich.

For dinner, our server recommended the Sirloin Culotte, Wagyu, Coal Roasted Carrots, Mac & Cheese, all of which were amazing and would definitely order again (Carrots are a must-order).  We were very impressed with the server's knowledge of the menu and the recommendations were on point. The food came out very fast, at the same time as our cocktails. Next time, we would order cocktails first.\n\nFor cocktails, Posie's Mescal was fantastic. The only issues we had were at brunch with a new server who brought us the Smoked Salmon Board instead of the House Smoked Salmon, and brought us a side of caramel for our takeout container instead of frosting. The salmon board was still very good, though, so we were not disappointed with that mistake. Highly recommend this restaurant, it is our favorite in Runway and we plan to return often.", "We live in Playa Vista and are always excited to see new spots opening up that are more about the ambiance and food.\n\nWe ordered the meatballs - def has a good flavor and a kick to them, would order them again.\n\nCheese biscuits are good, wish they had a honey butter to go with them.\n\nFried oysters - this was our first time ordering them anywhere. Honestly, I thought they were gross... we are big oyster fans so wanted to give them a try. Totally ruined them in my opinion.\n\nRib eye steak - was cooked perfectly. Would def come back for this one.\n\nMac and cheese was good but nothing over the top.\n\nCocktails - think they are still working out the kinks on this one. We typically like sweeter drinks and most on the menu seemed to be more whiskey based.\n\nAnd the service is great! Everyone was so friendly!", "I had dinner on Saturday here with some good friends.\nThe food was delicious.\nWe had:\nThe Oregon shrimp on toast that was floating in a tasty lobster bisque, was really really good. though the shrimp while billed as Oregon bay shrimp were  much larger than any Oregon bay shrimp i've ever had.\nWe had the jalepeno mac and cheese.  also super good.\nThe Mushrooms in the dell or forest or whatever it is, but pretty good.\nWe ordered the big 20 oz steak and split it among the three of us.  Our waiter should have anticipated that we were going to ask the kitchen to slice it, so it did come back a bit cooled off, but was still pretty tasty after getting sliced.\nI would sit outside when I come back as that atmosphere in the main dining area seems a bit off, or at the bar which had a nice vibe.", "I regrettably had dinner here with my girlfriend and her family. We ordered three plates of Spanish fried rice, a pan-roasted seabass, and two other dishes. After waiting half an hour, we were informed that the Spanish fried rice and the seabass were suddenly unavailable. I literally thought it was a joke. It was not. Our waitress then stood right next to our table expecting everyone to instantly locate their second choices. We told her we needed a bit more time, so she left us alone for another 30 minutes. By then everyone was hungry and extremely annoyed.\n\nAt the end of the dinner, our waitress apologized and offered a discount on the bill. I appreciate the nice gesture, but it does not make up for the train wreck that came before it.\n\nTo be sure, the restaurant has potential. Their location is great and their outdoor seating is tasteful. But if they do not have adequate supplies or staff, they should not be open.", "Amazing food, excellent service; hands down the best trendy restaurant without all of the bad parts! We had 6 items on the menu for dinner and all were pieces of art and super tasty! The Chiken entree is something high-end meets your grandma's comfort food, sauce is the best! Highly recommend ribs appetizer and key lime pie -- both sensational. That butter lettuce salad was out of this world! Seafood bouillabaisse is nice, but needs bread for dipping possibly?  I only had a mock-tail, no alcohol, but it was nice too. Ambiance is super trendy but not overly done. Art Deco meets modern relaxed Cali vibe. Our servers were attentive and knowledgeable, five stars on service! Loved it! A rare find! Do try it!", "Great ambiance and food presentation with a lot of potential.  Similar to the other reviews, service is definitely amiss and very lacking considering the prices.  Limited menu for brunch and not very kid friendly despite the location.  For brunch, the sandwiches are large but messy.  The blue crab with asparagus was delicious (but portion is small). In regards to the service, the server could not recommend a specific drink when asked.  Took forever to take our orders, follow up regarding a certain dish and provide an extra water cup.  In the end he gave us a stained takeout bag!!  Very disappointing especially when celebrating Mother's Day brunch.", "They did a great job during Covid.  Food was fantastic as was ambience and servers.  Just a pleasure to eat with playful cuisine.  The pastrami steak and ribeye cap was out of this world.

Appropriate modern alternative design to the Carmel Valley \"Lodge\" style.\n\nFood:  A+.

Both of us have a taste for fine dining but with 3 young children, meals like these are few and far between. Our server was attentive but knowing it was a special occasion, was not intrusive. We had the tasting menu and it was just as great as it could be. Each course seamlessly melded into the next with ingredients that weren't repetitive and explored the bounty of central California and the classical French preparations that we are used to.\nThe wine list was relatively concise but had all the hard hitters with a good amount of old world selections which is often a breath of fresh air coming from California wine country.\nA 2.5 hour long meal isn't for everyone so for those who want a quicker more low key bite, there is a lounge right there as well with live entertainment and TVs that play sports contests.\nIt's not cheap, but you're also at a resort that is hopefully paying its staff a living wage. And to be fair, you should be spending good amounts of money to nourish yourself anyway.\nA delightful meal! We will be back for my birthday.", "My husband and I dined at Marinus (the previous version of Lucia) about 3 years ago and absolutely loved it. The new restaurant, Lucia, did not disappoint. The decor still gives an aura of an upscale restaurant without being too stuffy. But the food is what will make you smile and come back for more. We came back to Lucia on Monday, Jan 18, and I wished I came back the next day after a disappointing dinner in Carmel. Don't miss the Monterey Bay abalone appetizer: the best spaghetti you'll ever have paired with a perfectly seared abalone. The special item on the menu was seared rock fish on a bed of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and greens. Delicious as always. Chef Cal is a culinary master, and we can't wait to come back. Lucia is by far the best restaurant in the Carmel and Monterey region.", "Newly renovated, Lucia Restaurant offers elegant white tablecloth indoor dining as well as a casual outdoor patio with heated floors. I had an abalone over spaghetti as a starter. There were two small bites of delicious farmed abalone. The spaghetti was cold upon arrival, but our server quickly had it warmed. The wild mushroom soup was richly textured, and the cassoulet was layered with several slices of juicy duck, and the rabbit with English peas and potato puree was full of flavor.  For dessert our server recommended the figs with sour cream ice cream and shortbread cookies. Fantastic. Very convenient to eat at Lucia when staying at Bernardus Lodge and Spa, but a restaurant that does stand on its own.", "My husband and I had the privilege of dining at the Chef's Table at Lucia for his birthday dinner. It was such a cool experience and like nothing we have done before. We were escorted to our booth right in the middle of the kitchen! Being people who enjoy food and like to dine at different restaurants around the world, getting a VIP view into the kitchen was awesome for us. To make everything even more pleasant we were immediately greeted by our waitress who was lovely and informative, our Sommelier was extremely educated and provided us some of the best wines we have ever had. The food itself was incredible and we enjoyed so many amazing plates including caviar, oysters, lamb, and a fabulous tea at the end. That was a truly enjoyable and delicious dinner. Thank you all at Lucia! We also had breakfast and lunch at Lucia the next day and enjoyed their salmon bagel plate, french toast etc. everything was tasty.", "We aren't frequent guests to Bernardus, but we've always been huge fans of Marinus and have eaten there on a couple of occasions. We found the food inspired, hyper-local/seasonal, and delicious. To sum it up, Lucia is none of these things - it's the kind of standard fare you'd find in any upscale-ish hotel/spa, which I suppose somewhat makes sense, but was such a huge disappointment. I can only hope that the lack of creativity and inspiration are temporary and in response to COVID-19 because while the resort it is great, the primary draw for us has always been Cal's tasting menu.\n\nIf you're into tuna tartare, caesar salad, grilled chicken breast, filet mignon, etc, this is the spot for you.

I did not even need to read the inscriptions to recognize some of my boyhood cricket heroes - Viv Richards, Joel Garner, Gordon Greenidge - from the golden era of WI cricket in the 1970s and 80s.\n\nWe ordered the jerk hen special and the curry puffs, and both were excellent. The jerk rub on the perfectly cooked hen was spicy hot as it is supposed to be, and the accompanying potato salad and arugula greens did a nice job tempering the heat.

The service was good. Our waiter asked us how we liked our food and we both told him the chicken and potato salad are good but the greens are way, way under-seasoned (as in no seasoning, just slightly smoked in pork, making them way too bitter). I then asked him to please give the chef my feedback. I did mention I'm West Indian and that's not the way our greens are usually served. He told me that the owner (Sarah) is from Barbados and he thinks she knows a little about West Indian food. I told him I admire him being protective of her, but there are already some Yelp reviews with people complaining about her flavor-free greens. Later, he said it could be the chef who's serving the greens that night.

The tacos were not served to the people that ordered them...it's not tapas, just serve people what they ordered.

I was expecting a similar experience to these places: somewhat overpriced American fare, not too adventurous of flavors, well crafted cocktails. However, I was surprised to find a menu that was more accessible than their other ventures and packed with flavor. We had the Al Pastor and Baja fish taco ($3-$4 each) and each were solid and super flavorful. The shells are made in house, and the fact they were slightly burnt made it feel truly home made. For cocktails, I think Paul McGee is behind the drink menu, as the drinks are on point. I had the old fashioned with pecan bitters which smelled amazing and was perfectly balanced.\n\nService was pretty good - these guys don't take reservations, but there's ample seating where you might get by without waiting. The only downside was the incredibly loud music - which serves the bar area well, but seemed unnecessarily loud for the dining area.

Located right in the heart of Little Italy, it offers a great mix between a terrific room and ambiance along with really well-prepared food.

It's almost too cheesy, but if you just take it all in and embrace it you understand the vibe they are trying to create.\n\nI typically head to the left and straight up the stairs because they feature an unbelievably cool open air bar area that is the perfect place to get a cocktail before sitting down to eat. Speaking of the upstairs... it's actually the best place in my opinion to enjoy your meal as it offers again great ambiance and style along with an that San Diego view to go with it.

My wife chose the 8 oz filet with dungeness crab and bernaise sauce. I had the 20oz dry aged bone in ribeye. Both came out perfectly cooked right on point. Our side dish was \"dirty\" hash browns with creme fraiche and caviar, so rich and decadent. Trevor gave me a brief cool short tour of where they dry age in building as well as the amazing kitchen. I kinda geeked out at the detail end planning they did to make this happen. Loved this steak house. Now my favorite . I want to take my family here. Thanks to Jonas the GM for stopping by he has an amazingly tight well trained staff.

It's a small place only encompassing a sushi bar with 3 sushi chefs. They specialize in torched sushi here. Service was attentive and explained every piece of fish and specials they had tonight. WIsh i had more stomach room as i would of ordered the special grilled fish collar. The omakase comes with a few items that stood out. The monkfish, seared salmon, seared tuna, uni, and eel.

The main chef is right in front of you in a very intimate setting. Authentically Japanese to the point that there's no soy sauce. Omakase at $125 for 16 pieces if not bad at all. Downside: again, very intimate setting. It's a little L-shaped restaurant. The whole restaurant is just the bar portion of what most sushi restaurant have. So forget intimate dining with a date. You'll be squished with strangers and it's tight. Also with the chef literally right in front of you there's that slight awkward intimidation factor. That said, these may be the exact reasons you like this place. It came highly recommended and the service was truly exceptional. The staff were super attentive. The sushi was good. Not to die for. I've had some places that it melts in your mouth and you dream about it. Not here. The only unique thing is some sushi they flame torch in front of you to give it a sear. I guess that's kind of cool. Overall a good place, worth trying especially if you're into super authentic Japanese. The omakase is plenty to eat and you will be stuffed. It's a solid place but didn't leave such an impression that I'm gaga over it.", "kura is pretty great, not easy to find if you don't know where to look (the wooden door next to the glass apartment building that is numbered 130), but definitely worth the visit. it's not cheap at around 65 dollars for a meal, but they can customize your meal according to your price range, and the quality and amount of food you get (around 6 courses) is definitely priced accordingly. the chef is super sweet and cute and the staff are learning but attentive. great for a date or dinner with friends who love japanese food, trying new things, customers/clients, etc. also a good selection of sake and beer. check it out before lines start out the door...", "My favorite omakase place by far. The whole omakase experience, vibe, temperature, level of noise and food quality was flawless.\n\nI've been to Sushi Noz, Nakazawa, Shoji 69, Cagen and many other omakase places in NYC, Kura stayed on top of my list.\n\nSushi was amazing, what makes the omakase special is that you get to try not your everyday fish and some seasonal fish as well. Kura offers this experience and they have delivered it.\n\nHighly recommended!", "Absolutely delicious sushi in the East Village. Kura feels like a hole in the wall spot with its unmarked entrance, and once you go inside it feels like you've been transported to a sushi oasis. The space has a counter and one table for larger parties. I've sat at both and they are equally great experiences. At the table they will still bring you sushi piece by piece.\n\nI also love Kura for their great prices. The menu is tiered and ranges from $100 to $200 depending on how many pieces you want. Their fish is fresh and most pieces are simple with just some soy sauce to let the fish itself shine. They also finish with a nice dessert.\n\nTheir chefs and staff are also so nice and friendly.

They had 3 chefs serving about 15 guests, so each guest had chances to interact with their chef a little.\n\nThe quality of this omakase was great. Fresh and with right amount of sauce (not too salty). The only thing I like to see is having the uni from Japan instead of Santa Barbara.

Same goes with Esterhazy slice.\nSabarsky torte is also a favorite of mine. It has alcohol, so not for kids.

Then came my Sachertorte served in a traditionalist style with a dollop of schlagober(whipped cream), looking very luscious! Voila my ultimate delectable layered chocolate cake!! Although I personally prefer the Sachertorte I had in Japan which was richer and more flavorful, it was still delicious. Espresso was good, by the way. Since it's a Viennese cafe, the coffee better be good, right?  I'm going to try the real Sachertorte at Hotel Sacher this summer!", "This place is quite elegant as it is in the Neue Gallerie, my favourite museum in all new york as being the only place that you can see authentic german and austrian art and pieces from Nolde, Kandinsky, Klimt, Klee etc. And the cafe is quite refreshing and suitable after a nice tour in this exquisite collection.\nYou should try the Mozarttorte if you like chocolate and a fan of pistachio, There are other stuff as well like Kirschtorte and Sachertorte but this one is actually something you can not find elsewhere in the city and an authentic example of what you will call the german sweet tooth. Also their Kaiser Melange is amazing with the added flavor of whipped cream and a perfect amount of tart coffee flavor.\nThe food menu is also very nice, maybe not as quite advanced as Wallse but still. You might enjoy the pretzels, a perfect spatzle and some bratwurst to cite a few.\nNice Job. - Again, Wallse and Blaue Gans are recommended if you are interested in german & austrian cuisine and actually know that there is more to that area than perfect beer and wurst.", "Came here with my partner before we went to the Klimt exhibition at the Neue Galerie - he had told me it's his favourite place to hang out in New York, so I simply had to see it. The restaurant is like something out of late 19th century Vienna, with wood panelling, tortes and strudels on display, and a more European approach to dining (as a English tourist, not having a glass of icy water thrust at me as soon as I sat down was appreciated, and I felt much more relaxed - I hasten to add, there was still drinking water on offer!).\n\nThe wiener schnitzel was delightful - light and tender - and my partner's meal (nicked a bite - couldn't resist!) was also very good.

I'm hoping this is due to the staff still working out the kinks as they are a brand new brick and mortar, but they are not brand new to preparing as they did pop-ups before opening.

Tried the frito pie and washed it down with a Topo Chico. The frito pie was great!

Not only are this chef's versions myriad, his approach is personal and especially slurpable.\nDiners may opt for the hot or cold ramen. The former (Chaplin A.S.S.) arrives with gloriously tender slabs of chicken and a sweltering broth; while the latter, with springy noodles, zesty ginger, and cool cucumber, is equally gratifying.

The restaurant is not far from the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. As soon as you enter, they have a popcorn machine available to munch on while you wait for a table. There's also a glass of dog treats for the fuzzy ones. The two leveled restaurant had a theatrical 1930's feel to it! The second floor had a projection screen playing black and white Charlie Chaplin movies.\n\nWhen I opened the menu, I wanted to order everything! I read about the Whiskey pork goyza but opted to try the fried chicken and shrimp shumai for starters. I normally get the steamed version but the fried had a nice crunch to it. The server recommended the Chaplin A.S.S. and it was delicious! Creamy, flavorful, and glorious are the words to describe it. The ramen had a little kick to it with the red peppers but the bowl was out of this world. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth hit the spot. It tasted similar to a Tom Yum soup so if you're a fan of Thai cooking, this is the ramen for you. Overall a solid place for your ramen fix and I'll definitely be back!", "I LOVED CHAPLIN'S!!!\n\nDefinitely the best ramen I've had in DC, and it's tied for first place with old school Ippudo up in NYC.  Not only is their ramen PHENOMENAL, but their cocktails are, too! Their bartender (I can't remember his name) is 10000% spot on all the time and a genius with a shaker.  \n\nWhat really put the place over the top for us is the fact that my wife, who has Celiac's disease (severe gluten allergy), was so well accommodated it was actually, like, touching.  The chef came out personally and explained that there was only one dish they could do and graciously took the extra time to make her ramen both a possibility but also DELICIOUS. We will be going back as often as possible!", "Our waiter was everything! I really, really, wish I remembered his name because he was just the best. However he did have to come over and tell us ten minutes after ordering our ramen that they were out of their house ramen the Chaplin. I was sad about this since I was so looking forward to it. I ended up going with the veggie ramen and adding in some egg. We ordered quite a few apps and lets just say they all went down easy. The pork buns were great as well as the shumai and classic edamame. My ramen was really delicious, the broth was flavorful and the vegetables had a nice bite to them. But I really could just not get that Chaplin ramen out of my head, will have to just head back in I guess. Lets talk about those tasty, tasty dessert sundaes. My favorite was the strawberry mochi sundae, but my table also loved the green tea mochi sundae. There was a bit of a debate when they arrived at the table on why we didn't order more. If you can save some room for dessert you won't be disappointed.", "oh my stars!! the ramen is sooooooooooo delicious.\nI ordered the Chicken A.S.S. It did not disappoint. I added bock choy and an egg because there wasn't as much stuff in it as I'd like. Oh my goodness. It was so delicious and spicy and hot. The perfect meal on a cold DC night. The drinks were equally as delicious. I would have wanted to try more of their specialty cocktails. The fried dumplings were also crazy delicious, fresh, hot and flavorful.\nThe service was pretty good. There was about a 40 minute wait on a Thursday night. There is popcorn for while you wait but we just grabbed a drink around the corner first. They text you when your table is waiting and in the summer there is outdoor seating.\nThe vibe was definitely alive and vibrant. The Charlie Chaplin theme was kind go cool although I don't know what he has to do with ramen.\nI would definitely be back when I need a ramen fix! We were talking all night about how freaking good our dinner was. It was sooooooooooo good!!!", "I went here with some friends on Saturday. I got the vagabond cocktail, which was great and not too strong. For appetizers we ordered the karaage and gyoza, both of which were great. Heads up that the fried gyoza doesn't mean \"pan-fried\" as I had assumed, but that the whole thing is fried, leaving a crispy exterior. I really enjoyed it, and was just pleasantly surprised at my misunderstanding. I also ordered the Chaplin A.S.S. ramen, which tasted great and wasn't too spicy. If anything, I wished that the flavor was a little stronger. For desert we had the chocolate cake, which was standard, and that came with ice cream. Overall pretty good, though I do wish our waiter had been a little more attentive, he seemed a bit MIA throughout the night.", "Flawless happy hour with amazing deals. I only had one drink and it strong, big and beautiful! (See \"the Cure\") Complete with rosemary blow-torched right in front of you. That cocktail was an experience, and I will definitely be coming back for another, also because it was only $6!!!\n\nThis was my first ramen bar ever, so granted I do not have a standard for it, but I loved it! I enjoyed eating it with chop sticks and cutting the soft egg was fun as well. The Stamina Spicy wasn't crazy spicy, so next time I may order a different meal or a side of some hot sauce to add an extra punch.\n\nService was excellent. The ambiance was quirky and fun. A little too noisy for normal conversation, but that doesn't bother me.

Yummy! So when I heard about Korean Duck BBQ I got to try it!\n\nI went for lunch on Friday to Koreatown which is the best time to come to this restaurant because there is no traffic and ample amounts of parking. Actually theres approximately 8 parking spots so make sure to not go when it's busy. This place to me feels like a hole in a wall with old outdated 1980s decor and the restroom feels like it's long overdue for an upgrade. But let's ignore all that and concentrate on the food.\n\nThe side dishes were really fresh which accommodates well with the duck. The actual meat is very flavorful and the best part of it is the fat. I love picking up each piece of meat with a piece of fried onion, then dipping it in the salt and pepper. Also don't come here yourself because they require a minimum of 2 orders. So my wife an I order 2 plates of seasoned duck for $27 each. After eating the BBQ they surprised us with a hot bowl of fried rice and a hot spicy soup. I was very satisfied with the meal and will definitely come again.", "I read about the clay oven duck at this restaurant in a foodie newsletter (Tasting Table?).  Immediately bookmarked and sent to my friends.\n\nWhen I think of Korean food, AYCE kbbq first comes to mind.  The clay oven duck at Dha Rae Ok is a nice change from that.  It's not that big considering it's $60, but it can feed maybe 3-4 people and it's worth a try!  Roasted for maybe 4 hours (you have to call ahead of time to order), the duck is stuffed with rice, veggies, and I don't remember what else, but some bits were bitter!  The meat is very tender, and it also comes with sides, soup and salad.\n\nI got props from the Korean friend for finding this restaurant...  you WILL need a Korean person if you come here.  The staff did not speak English.  By the way, same thing when you order the duck over the phone.  I had to talk to 3 different people before someone finally figured out that I wanted to order a duck haha.", "My family came here for a Father's Day dinner on Sunday at around 6PM. We had two of their most popular dishes, the smoked duck and the roasted duck along with the bbq duck.\n\nThe smoked duck was alright. It was pretty pricey for $70. It was a good amount for two people, but we shared it among five people because we also ordered other dishes. It tasted a lot like ham, and for the same price, we wouldn't get it again.\nThe roasted duck was something my mom enjoyed a lot. To get this, you have to call exactly four hours in advance. It was very healthy and its contents were filled with lots of sticky rice, nuts, and herbs. It comes with a spicy soup kalgooksoo with the soup tasting a lot like ramen powder, something a lot of Koreans add to make things taste better.\nThe BBQ duck was our favorite. While there is a minimum order of two servings because we had already ordered a lot, they allowed to order just one. It was savory and tasty, and there was a lot for one serving.\nFor dessert, they gave us a plate of watermelon, which was very refreshing. Overall, their service was excellent, and food was overall good, but a little bit on the pricier side.", "Dha Rae Ok is more than \"OK,\" it's delicious!\n\nOkay, so enough with the cheesiness, but Korean duck BBQ is bomb. I had no idea it could taste so darn good. I've had duck cooked Chinese style (Peking, etc.) but it's I always felt that the duck takes on a different taste than what it actually is.\n\nSmoked Duck: it tastes like bacon! I LOVE bacon, and let me tell you the smokiness is just melt-in-your-mouth goodness. When they serve it to you, they're just warming it up on the pot since it's already cooked.\n\nSliced Duck: still bomb, it's great. I think I may love it more than brisket *gasps.*\n\nI'm not sure why the place has poopy reviews! The waitress was friendly and provided great customer service for our large party (group was about 12 people total). She even threw in a spicy soup for us at the end (for free)! What more could I ask for?! Hoping I didn't creep her out too much since I kept saying, \"I'm so happy right now!\" the whole time... Anyway, thanks Dha Rae Ok!

The kimchi was delicious. Legit delicious.\n\nIt was almost too much food for the three of us, but in hindsight, it was perfect. Even moreso with what I assume was kalgooksu at the end, though the gentleman told us it was jjigae.\n\nWell, is was great. The kalgooksu had just enough spice and it was a wonderful end to a filling meal.\n\nI think the gentleman that helped us the most was the owner. He was super sweet. I felt very welcome there and having awesome food certainly helped.\n\nMust bring more people here!", "Had an all around great dining experience last night. The servers are very friendly.  None of us are fans of duck but their duck was great! Tasty, tender, not gamy. The order came with spicy duck stew with noodles, also delicious.  Can't wait to go back.

Absolutely amazing, I wasn't about to let any of that go to waste!\n\nThen came the duck breast. It's prepared with baby beets, barley, and brooks cherries. The duck breast was cooked rare, but it was perfection. I could not get enough of the delicious - what seemed to be a cherry/beet reduction sauce!

Very crispy and perfect as a side dish to the meats.\n\nThis time I got the steak with peppercorn sauce. The only downside is another person ordered the same thing at my table but I ordered it medium rare and he ordered medium. They served us both the wrong temp- me getting the medium. Luckily, the sauce was so food it masked the overcooked meat but now I'm wondering how much better it would have been with the temp I ordered.\n\nThe short ribs are fantastic but heavy. I also tried the tuna which is perfect and my go to is the green salad. The menu is simple but they really do perfect the simple things.\n\nWe will be regulars.

One suggestion for them would be to revisit the music playlist...I understand that a eclectic playlist of rock, classic hip hop, and 70s makes for a more trendy environment but perhaps a more cafe, bistro French assortment of music might be more suitable for the environment that you're trying to recreate??\n\nThe stand out dishes were the soft egg w Kaluga Caviar!! Burgundy Escargots en Croute (I recall Republique had served this at one time), Mary's Chicken Viennoise, Carmelized Onion Tarte Tatin...we had several other dishes that were good but it didn't stand out as much as these specific dishes.\n\nService was spot on.

When you would mop up the broth with it you would get a very satiating soft juicy bread by with a crispy layered to pop it off.\n\nThe entrees were delicious but pretty taxed for what they were.

We also had the Cajun Gumbo. Spicy and delicious. The andouille sausage was cut small so you could get some with every bite. I saw they had churros on the dessert menu and ordered the immediately because my wife loves them. We usually share dessert but when Frank recommended the bourbon glazed donuts, I ordered them too. The churros were great but the donuts were one of the best things I've ever eaten. Large and fluffy. The glaze was incredible.\n\nWe love finding great restaurants like this but it's frustrating when they are over an hour away. We're going to find a reason to go back to Southern Table soon. I'm working on tomorrow.", "A restaurant to definitely go back to & try everything!  Absolutely delicious!!!   I love the open kitchen concept as you can see all the food coming out & looks like a magazine cover.\nAs appetizers, we had the Corn (tasty tasty) and also the Watermelon Salad (was like summer on a plate), a great sharing dish & so so refreshing!    Dinner was Chicken & Waffles and I ordered the Ribs.  Very tasty BBQ sauce & meat fell off the bone.  Chicken had a great crunch & super tender - done perfectly.  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes.  Mike's Hot Honey (on table) was the bees knees!  Very full & happy happy!!!  :)", "A great addition to Pleasantville with outdoor seating.  We chose to eat outside because the noise level in the modern warehouse restaurant was quite loud.  Personally I would not go there if I had to eat inside, I think it would be hard to have a conversation.Eating outside on a nice night was enjoyable. We started off with a Sparkle Honey cocktail & Kolasch beer with the Potato Cheese potstickers. . They were crispy and creamy inside an very light & delicious.  Then we had the Hush Puppies, lightly fried and crisp on the outside but dense on the inside, a little disappointing. Next , my daughter had the Shrimp & Grits Bowl, the shrimps were cooked perfectly and the grits were herb seasoned and creamy. She enjoyed the dish. I had a taste of the grits & they were perfect. I had the Blackened Salmon topped with cucumbers on a ranch dressing with shredded mixed vegetables .  The salmon was perfectly cooked but very salty,as was the cucumbers & dressing.  Even after removing the cucumbers, the top of the salmon and dressing, the salmon was still salty but edible. The vegetables were perfectly seasoned and enjoyable. Our servicwas very attentive and answered our questions on certain dishes.  I will definitely be back to try other dishes. service a little slow.", "I am not particularly a lover of fried food, but they do have decent fried chicken. It's not too greesy. But I do absolutely love their biscuits. I think one of the best I have had, especially when they are warm. I think the only thing I don't like on their menu is their Avocado toast, there is barely any Avocado on it. Great ambiance and would highly recommend anyone who is looking for local food and would support the community! The reason for four stars is the service is a hit or miss.

The potato pancakes, golden brown and soul satisfying, would make any oma proud.

The inside tables inside was a mixture of regular tables, bar tables and tables with benches by the window with a nice view of the Estuary and Coast Guard Island.\n\nThere is a decent selection of German and domestic beers.  Checking out the menu, our order consisted of:\nJager Schnitzel - pork cutlet with mushroom gravy, sp\u00e4tzle, rotkohl and sauerkraut. The pork cutlet was tender but mushroom gravy needed more mushrooms and the amount of gravy overwhelmed the cutlet.\nLeberkase - veal meatloaf with spatzel and rotkohl. Had a taste and the meatloaf reminded me of a pressed loaf than a typical meatloaf.\n\nOverall, service was friendly and attentive.  Nice view from the restaurant. Compared to the German restaurant in Alameda, the beer selection does not come close and the food, though good, is not as good as the other restaurant.", "Been here twice now, both times for lunch.

Finally, the inside reminds me of so many beer halls I went to in Germany I had to send pics to Munich.\n\nI read some reviews about slow service and high prices. So far I have had nothing but great service and I feel like you get what you pay for with the prices. It's yummy handmade food and top quality beer...not Pabst and a frozen burger.\n\nThis place is a current fave and now I'm hungry....", "This place has an amazing view right over the Oakland Estuary.

Had the mussels that came in a tasty white brew.   Also had potato pancakes which were not bad.   Service was super slow.

So, I decided to come back during the week. Made it before the rush and had a great lunch.\n\nI love that I can tie my dinghy up to their docks. While Jack London Square is another place, this little cafe by the water brings with it, its own feel. That they have both indoor and outdoor seating is great, as well.\n\nI do agree with the posters regarding animals. While I get that they're animal friendly, I urge the management to set up a completely separate area. While I love animals, I don't want them around my food. And esp don't want them begging.

I tried a dish off the brunch menu since I saw that the spaetzle was house made, but the result was a little uneven.  The poached eggs of the Autumn Benedict were supposed to be resting on cheese spaetzle but the pasta was left off the dish entirely.  I requested it on the side, but once I received it the dish was half gone since cold poached eggs are not appealing.  Also, one egg was beautifully poached and the second was over.  The winner dish is the sausage plate which featured a venison sausage that was slap yo mama good and came out with a piping hot pretzel big enough to share.  I would have dipped it in the cheese of the spaetzle if I had had it.  \n\nI would return on a beautiful day and hang out on the large outdoor deck.

The sausages are pretty good (not the best & not the worst I've had).  Wish they offered better quality mustard to go with them.  I usually share a sausage platter because it's a good value for 2.  We each get 1 sausage & share the spaetzle & a pretzel.  I usually give them all of the sauerkraut because I'm not a fan.  On the last visit, the spaetzle was too salty.\n\nIt's a welcome treat to sit outside on a patio with a water view.  There is shade from the umbrellas if you don't want to sit in direct sun.

Omurice is a modern Japanese dish that consists of fried rice wrapped in omelette and topped with sauce. The sausage sauce that this dish came with was amazing and the eggs were so soft!

The shakshuka did not come with bread, which is pretty unusual, but the merguez did come with pita and a salad dumped on top and it felt like it was missing something because it looked basic. to add insult to injury, the music was horrible and not in line with a restaurant at this price point (think top 40 early 2010's).\n\nWe definitely won't be returning because of the horrible food poisoning experience but if you do decide to dine here I would stick strictly to the vegetarian fare.", "Saturday brunch res made via Resy.\n\nRes for 3 so we got cute round table in corner.  High chairs available.\n\nStarted with the house made labne - not as creamy as most I've had but the zatar, harissa, and pomegranate seeds on top are def a nice and unique touch. Gives a little spicy kick!  The fried halloumi is battered and fried thus is denser, a tad too salty for me but still delish!\n\nHubby got the shakshuka which is perfectly done - cauliflower is a nice twist. I got a new menu item - mushroom lamahjon which had hen of the wood mushrooms, labne, garlic on flatbread. It also had a wonderful lemon oil all over that was amazing!\n\nThe trifecta pastry platter had olive oil cake, baklava cinnamon rolls and pastry twists - all indulgent and delicious!  Service was excellent also!", "I'm a sucker for middle eastern food, especially when a place makes it unique and interesting.\n\nThe place is open and bright. The walls have bright blue & white tiles. Chairs are woven, benches comfy. Overall, very fun, relaxing ambiance.\n\nWe did brunch. For starters, we split the Whipped Feta + Pistachio (whipped feta is a nice, spreadable take on feta cheese), Beet Tzatziki (gotta love beets), and Tahini. The Tahini fell a little flat, but the rest was great.\n\nFor the table, we also split:\nShakshuka - the namesake. really well done. The okra were a nice touch.\nTunisian Breakfast - less imaginative, but solid lamb merguez. And I always like muhammara.\nChicken Shawarma - for brunch?! Yes, please. Loved the chicken's flavors. And the red cabbage.\nChocolate Babka French Toast - babka is an interesting take on french toast. Plus it was a much needed sweet foil to all our salty dishes.\n\nSolid cocktails, though they didn't necessarily blow me away. Refreshing, though.\n\nA really strong brunch spot that is great for groups!", "Shuka offers up such a delicious spread.\n\nTry the the taramasalata. It's a smoked fish dip, which you're going to want to dip all things in.  It's also a pretty sizable portion, so great for sharing and enjoying throughout the meal.\n\nThe kebabs are spiced and well seasoned. They come with a yogurt sauce, which you're also going to want to pour over everything. The brussel sprouts are a nice addition to bring some additional brightness to the meal. Of course, ordering a side of fries is always a good idea. And, if you like spicy smoky cocktails, go for the Ankara.\n\nTheir outdoor dining set up is nice and heated.  \n\nGreat overall!", "I've been to this place for both brunch and dinner and food overall has been good (some outstanding dishes but a few mediocre ones).\n\nDishes that I liked:\n- Crispy squash flowers - this was so good! The batter is crispy but slightly chewy on the inside too. It tasted quite light, and flavorful!\n- Whipped feta with pistachio - this spread was so good! Very nutty and slightly savory. This went so well with the warm pita served\n- Taramasalata - very fresh and quite light\n- Chocolate babka french toast (brunch) - So fluffy and decadent! Think chocolate babka from Breads Bakery dipped in egg wash, seared in butter and drizzled in warm chocolate sauce. Mmmm so good.\n- Mediterranean plate (brunch) - this had a nice variety of protein/veggies and the eggs were perfectly cooked.\n\nDishes that could be skipped:\n- Kebabs - this was just ok, and portions were small\n- Hummus - this was just ok also, similar to store bought hummus in my opinion", "Lovely place, lovely service very busy for a Sunday breakfast. I showed up at 10:26 and when they open at 10:30 lots of people strolled in (I assume w reservations) I couldn't decide on a dish so I left two options for my waiter to surprise me....I got the green shakshuka and it was EXCELLENT.\nThere's a tang of lime?! W the garlicky yogurt?! And the mint, dill, little mustard seeds, spinach and poached eggs... UGH, delicious. I wanted to lick the little bowl at the end. Very tasty dish. I'm into this garlicky tangy flavor movement right now and this has it. All you need after is a handy tic tac....hehe...", "The food is absolutely delicious!\nI'd highly recommend the pistachio dip and fattoush salad.\nThe halloumi cheese in the salad is so fluffy and crispy - amazing!\n\nI suggest making a reservation if you plan to go for dinner.

It\u2019s only the most darling backyard patio and garden, of course.Chef Tomer Blechman puts his own stamp on the ancient cuisine of the Middle East. Whipped ricotta with brown butter, sage, and honey may just convince you to set aside the flatbread and pick up a spoon, while smoky octopus is ramped up with grassy Castelvetrano olives. Hanger steak, bathed in a charred onion tahini, will have you begging for more.

All the dishes that other reviewers have praised are spot on, so I just want to reaffirm the greatness of the whipped ricotta (with brown butter, sage and honey!!) the baba ganoush, and the salmon that is so perfectly crusted and melts in your mouth. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu though.\n\nThe patio is wonderful, especially as summer is starting up, and the staff are so friendly and helpful. Chef Tomer even came out at one point and checked in with the diners. Awesome hospitality.\n\nFrom the cozy decor to the warm ambience to the delicious and exciting food, this place is not to be missed.", "Always in search of interesting new Mediterranean spots, we decided to make the trip to Fort Greene to try Miss Ada last Saturday after reading about it in the NY Times.  Definitely worth the trip:\n\nWe took our chances coming without a reservation and when we arrived at 8:30pm it was packed; however, they have a great outdoor seating area for you to wait for your table while you enjoy your drink so the wait went quickly.  Cocktails were perfectly executed.\n\nOnce seated we ordered the labneh, falafel, baba ganoush, stracciatella, octopus, market salad and hummus to start and the salmon and hanger steak for entrees.  The falafel, in particular, was standout, as was the octopus.  The hummus was also excellent and next time we want to try some of the other varieties such as lamb shawarma.  I usually view salmon as a boring order but the za'atar crusted one here was anything but.  We finished with the chocolate mousse, malabi and sufganiyot--hard to pick a favorite there.  \n\nService was overall excellent; they're going for friendly neighborhood vibe and succeeding.  Already excited to go back.", "This is one of my new favorite restaurants. Yes, in New York, decent middle eastern food is everywhere, street carts, holes in walls, restaurants....and it's usually pretty good. This place place is 10 steps up, the food (and drinks) are the kind that you eat and make your dining partner have a bite of. It's a \"You have GOT to try this\" place. So, you've had baba ghanoush? Doesn't matter. You have got to try this one...and on & on. Even the pita is many steps above the regular.\n\nA bit cool fabulous (crowd & location spawns that). Great for sharing plates. My friend & I ordered 6 small plates / apps and several drinks and it was perfect.\n\nI'm a vegetarian and my friend is a major carnivore. We shared everything but the short rib skewer. So, there's something for everyone. See, we can all get along...despite our differences.\n\nIt was crowded, with an hour wait on a Thurs eve so we sat at the bar, which is great if it's just two.\n\nService is brusk but food is so worth it.", "My experience here was top notch. I emailed the restaurant to request a reservation for 5 people since parties over 4 aren't available to request on Resy. The woman who responded to my email greeted me personally and remembered all the details I wrote in the email - she was incredibly sweet. The service overall was wonderful. And the food - there have been many Israeli/Mediterranean restaurants popping up around the city lately, and as someone who has lived in the Middle East for a number of years, I have to say Miss Ada might be my favorite. Do not miss out on the haloumi skewers and the labne. The lamb hummus was unbelievable. And order the babka for dessert! Can't wait to try the brunch. Super authentic and super recommended!!", "Believe the hype! Came here for a date night finally after convincing my partner (who, like clockwork, will always choose Mexican or Italian food) that it could potentially be our \"new spot\" based on friend recs and general reviews. It was pretty busy but not crowded and the service was attentive and knowledgeable, especially about the interesting wine list and extensive cocktails, which are seasonal and unpretentious. Back area was cute and open with big tables for big groups.\n\nThey had yummy off-menu selections like a steak skewer as well as salmon. Opted for the lamb shawarma as recommended by the server as well as carrots and whole fish. Just the right amount of toasty pita to go with the hefty sized dips like babaganoush and hummus.....they'll give you more if you want. The flavors are all so balanced and warming, as if mamma cooked for you- regardless of your background or where you're from! Just the right amount of seasoning and an experienced touch made the food stand out.\n\nTiming and pace of the meal was thoughtful. Left full but not bloated and the check made sense for what we ordered. Would go back to try other things.", "Wow. I have eaten here several times and this review is long overdue. The atmosphere at Miss Ada is warm and fun. The garden is enchanting. The food is incredible, so flavorful and special. You can really feel the love that was cooked into every dish. The sweet potato hummus and the ricotta with brown butter are the stuff dreams are made of. I could eat all the mezze straight with a spoon, but the pita is fluffy and dangerously irresistible (don't eat too much or you won't have room for what's to come!). The octopus is delicious, the falafel is unexpected, the Jerusalem artichoke soup is SO FREAKIN' GOOD. The salmon is delightful, perfectly cooked, and so unlike any salmon dish I've ever had. I don't eat meat, but this place makes me want to, and my carnivorous friends have always had rave reviews. I've never eaten at a restaurant where I have been so consistently in love with the food. There is nothing on the menu that I have not relished. The neighborhood has been blessed with a food heaven. Make reservations.", "Amazing food and great price.

The bar in the front is charming and quiet.  The same servers have been there the entire time I've gone, and seeing a familiar face is comforting.

Maybe I've mellowed out with age, but I value that consistency more now.\n\nRecently, I've had the below:\n- Warm chicken salad: My favorite dish!!

Very refreshing and tasty\n- Country Salad with poached egg\n- Charcuterie & p\u00e2t\u00e9s selection\n- Cassoulet (a ton of beans and a bunch of different kinds of meat.

Yes, they brought the paintings and the waiters, but it quickly lost it's mojo and food tates changed.  Benoit is an ok bisto not unlike the lackluster places you will find in Paris.  It's namesake is not much better.  If you really want something special and old style, save your money (don't even consider the wine list!) and go to La Grenouille.

It was beautifully plated, with some good colour and texture. But there was pretty much just one big piece of octopus for the entire dish. It was tasty but not really a great value at $25. And that was one of the lower price items on the menu.\n\nWhat was terrible: the worst pommes frites I think I have ever had. My friend thought they might have been the bottom of the batch. They were thin and flavourless. I tried to improve the taste with salt, pepper and condiments but I should have just sent them back. I said something to the waiter about the fries at the end of the meal when he collected the only partially eaten fries but he had no response.  \n\nBe prepared for a pricey meal.

The heavy-flavored Foie mignon aux poivers, peppercorn sauce is well done. The taste of Sauce and the side dishes cover the smell of beef liver and it is very tender. It is topped with their beef bone soup and seasoned.  Those who didn't like this dish before thought it was good .  Their desserts are not sloppy, we tried their Our Baba, Armagnac& whipped cream, which is very distinctive and fragrant and soft and moderately sweet, but the wine is too strong, it's best not to order if you don't drink , and Escargots  It is also a must order -- feeling wonderful at Benoit Bistro.", "A friend recommended Benoit, a classic French restaurant and we were not disappointed!

In fact, get two or three and share them with the table!!! We tried the mussels and clams in a soup-like presentation which was pretty tasty as well. The schnitzel was impeccably flavorful in all its deep-fried goodness. The sp\u00e4tzle was not as cheesy as I had hoped, but was very good.

First of all, the ambiance walking up is so romantic and inviting. It's got the modern, rustic, chic vibes...not to mention a pretty funky playlist (hello Curtis Mayfield) and fresh flowers on each table.\n\nWe went in and picked a table near the open garage door to be partial outdoor.

Long tables remind you of the German/Austrian influence, and then some bizarre unexpected dishes are on the menu (Tiramisu?) because it is technically Austrian and Mediterranean.  That's a lot!\nBut the menu is not overwhelming; it is relatively limited but varied and interesting .  The brussel sprouts were amazing.  Really, better than most anywhere.  My schnitzel was great--a nice, thin piece of meat and fried to perfection. If only it were Jaegar instead of Weiner....it needs sauce desperately, a sauce to equal the schnitzel would elevate this dish to unforgettable.  Right now, as is, it's just good.  As was my companion's bratwurst.  The beans it was atop were really good....but...what else could that dish have....can't put my finger on it.  Another brat would be a good start, since it comes with only one and a small one, at that.\n Happy hour wine choices were somewhat limited, IM(very)HO.  \nGreat atmosphere.

I turned to my trusty Chef friend and he recommended Carlitos Gardel.  \n\nWe ordered the Shrimp in a white wine and garlic sauce app.  Is was a special of the evening.  The shrimps were cooked very well but they could have used more flavor. I also ordered a beef empanada that was fantastic.\n\nOn to the main course we both ordered Steak. I had the special 18oz Prime NY smothered in Peppercorn and Mushroom Sauce.  It was accompanied by Mash and Mixed Veg.  The steak was wonderful and the Mash were amazing.  The recommended wine went with the food perfectly.  They recommended a \"Domingo Hermanos\" Malbec.  Very Tasty.\n\nI capped off the meal by having an espresso  and a slice of there Chocolate Cake.  I don't remember the exact name since I was a bottle of wine in, all I know is that the dessert was heaven.\n\nThe prices were moderate but with the white table cloths it feels like you are spending alot more.  \n\nGreat for Dates.  Piano Player, Mood Lighting and Nice \"Corner\" Tables.  \nThe 2 girls who were making out at the table next to us seemed to enjoy it!!", "I thought this was just average.  For a place with such a good repuatation for steaks, I would have expected much better.  I think the service was slow.  We called and were told that they had plenty of space and could seat us right away, but when we arrived, it was clear that wasn't entirely true.  Then they made us wait next to a \"bar\" which was about the size of one of those portable home bars on wheels.  Nowhere to stand or sit without being bumped around in this tiny place.  I get suspect of restaurants that have gigantic proportions - the amount of french fries should be a crime of gluttony.  Again, not spectacular.\n\nI would only return if they had live music there and could therefore appreciate a more Argentine-cultural experience.", "Our waiter had the personality of a door knob. His attitude was so bad it made half the restaurant feel uncomfortable, that's what I observed in the other diners faces. It's always shocking to me what people consider good food. This place has 4.5 stars and the food was terrible!! The two bests things we had were the Italian beer and the Argentinian rose.  I'm a fan of salt but i have to say everything we ordered was over salted even for me.  We started with a couple of appetizers. The sweetbreads, the mista and empanadas were just salty, as well as the chimichurri. Next, I had the pasta and the ragu  was horrible!!  there was so much sugar in  the sauce, it tasted like dessert. The raviolis themselves were good.  My wife had the cap of the ribeye which was the reason we went to this restaurant. Served cold and tough. She makes tastier rib eyes that are so much more tender and we get them at Ralph's.  The only other thing that was good here besides our drinks was the manager. He gave us excellent service and was very knowledgeable. Pass on this place. Save your money and don't waste your time .", "The food is very good. We ordered papas fritas, spinach empanada and lengua a la vinegreta for appetizers.

Lastly we ordered two types of dessert, one is postre gardel and I forgot the name of the other one because it was ok and not so memorable.\nThe ambiance is warm and quiet, the restroom is disappointing because it's a portable one exactly like the ones in an airplane, very small and cramped, the wash area is outside close to the portable restroom.  They did made it private though by putting curtains.\nOur server is okay, nothing special about his service and he's hard to hear.\nI recommend the papas fritas, very tasty for French fries but eat it with your meal not as an appetizer coz its pretty heavy. I also recommend the Lengua for appetizer and the Parrillada, however it cost $110  but comes with ribs, steak, veal, and 2 types of sausages.\nWould I come back again?  Maybe not just because theres so many more restaurants around there that i would like to try specially Im not from LA.", "Top notch service (they remembered me after only one previous visit!), excellent chorizo, fries, steak, mashed potatoes... but the BEST part is dessert.

The HUSO Dog, which looks like a hot dog, but it is actually a king crab leg prepared like a lobster roll style, topped with caviar. I also could eat ten of this.

The prosciutto on the charcuterie board added the perfect salty bite to their crisp bread. But the real star was the Huso Dog. This Alaskan king crab upon a fluffy bun with caviar and slivers of avocado is one of the best things I've eaten in my life.

What you do is get in line and order your food and pay for it. Then you sit down at a table and wait until it is delivered to your table. Everyone who works there was very friendly and extremely nice. I found the prices to be fair considering the quality of what you're getting.\n\nMy friend had a 3 lb Lobster and it was huge. I had the combination plate which was really really good. The cole slaw and soup was fantastic!\n\nThe one other thing that I really liked was the water station.

The Chicken and Eggnog Waffles came with strawberry butter, which is so so sweet and better than strawberry jam! It made the thick golden waffles taste even more amazing!  Their fried chicken was extra crisp and not dry. However there wasn't much flavor, hence the 4 stars. But for 14.95 I was satisfied and left with a happy tummy!\n\nThe country catfish comes with two sides, I chose candied yams and their tres macaroni and cheese. Their Mac and cheese is very tasty and cheesy, not overly salty! The candied yams are sweet and cooked until perfectly tender. The catfish is one of the best I have eveer tried! It's fresh and tasty and with the aioli, it's even more delicious. This was worth 14.95! It was a lot to eat, and I ate it all!\n\nMake a reservation unless you want to wait for an hour! It's a loud swanky place with great comfort food and worth the trip!", "I literally live right around the corner from this place, so this place is pretty much my default date spot.  The restaurant boasts southern comfort food for its cuisine, but the food is more inventive than that name would suggest.  As a lineup I would certainly recommend the Soul Food Spring Rolls, Short Ribs, Mac & Cheese, and one of the vegetable sides, none of which particularly stand out.  While all of the food is good, there is better soul food to be had, but for an overall experience and for the innovation in some of the dishes, Melba's is one of the best.\nAs far as the ambiance goes, the place is small, but quaint and has a quasi-church pew setup inside.  All of that makes for a very comfortable eating experience, and I've never had an issue with the service.  My only complaint would be the live music that is sometimes offered.  For my taste, the restaurant is far too small to support live music, unless your into struggling to keep food on your vibrating fork. Overall, avoid the live music and you're guaranteed to have a good time.", "I tried Melba's for dinner on Saturday after my friend (who lives in Harlem and is from the south) recommended it to me. So glad I came in-- We had such a great meal. The service was great-- friendly and attentive.\n\nWe started with the spring rolls -- I have never had a spring roll like this before- it comes with rice, black eyed peas, collard greens and cheddar cheese- but it was so tasty.\n\nFor the entrees, I got the catfish with mac & cheese and collard greens on the side. The catfish was great and I enjoyed my sides equally as much. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles-- He said he couldn't really taste the eggnog in the waffle, but enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, this was a good meal and I would definitely recommend if you are in the area.", "Recently moved to Brooklyn and was told about this restaurant by my mother who had heard so many good things about it. Wellll she wasn't wrong! Met up with some friends in Harlem and when you walk in you are immediately greeted! The music choices of the night were lovely, and I was singing the whole night. A lot of birthdays that night so we sung Happy Birthday to others, Harlem Style of course, and everyone was just overall very friendly and welcoming.\n\nNow the food was exceptional! I started the night with a Rum Punch (not pictured) and it was really good, strong but still tasty! I got the Southern Fried Chicken and you have the choice of dark meat, white meat, or wings. I opted in for the wings. Crispy, well seasoned and perfect paired with some hot sauce. Now the Mac was probably the highlight of the meal. Very creamy and cheesy, and tasty!! I've never had anything like it. Greens were good, just how my mom makes them. Overall Melba's is a great spot to receive a nice southern home cooked meal, with great vibes and a fun time!", "Ooooooh chile!!!! Let me tell you about MELBA'S. Heaven on a plate that's what it is. All joke aside... Melba's is an awesome brunch spot! If you're looking for quality soul food, look no more. The smothered chicken and waffles is my personal favorite. The fried chicken and waffles is also amazing. The next time I go I think I'll try the French toast. My friend had it and said it was fantastic. The food is tasty, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere screams elegance and black excellence. Sunday brunch gets really crowded so make sure you get there early. It can also be a little loud during peak brunch times so keep that in mind as well.\n\nThe prices are fair but this place is not cheap!! However, the food is worth every single penny. After brunch at Melba's I find myself stuffed and unable to eat for the rest of the day!!! Keep blessing our stomachs!!!", "Melba's is a requirement on almost every trip to Harlem to visit my boyfriend. It's a neighborhood favorite, the food is DELICIOUS, the staff is super friendly, and I've even made new friends as the patrons are just as friendly and in great spirits, all b/c of the food I'm sure. The beef shorts ribs, mac and cheese and greens are to die for. Pretty much everything in the menu is great, but do yourself a favor and order the mac and cheese as a side.

We started with an talong (eggplant) salad, lech\u00f3n kawali (crispy pork belly), Shanghai lumpia, and Janice's ribs. These appetizers were delicious! Some might say the ribs are too sweet but I think they are a good example of all the different flavors of Filipino cuisine - sweet and salty and more. For the mains, we had the Pork Adobo (more of a vinegar-y taste), the grilled Branzino fish (which was cooked to Perfection) and the pancit sotanghon. The sotanghon didn't really stand out to me, as I've had better elsewhere, but overall a SUPERB meal. Be sure to reserve a table in advance, taste their house hot sauce, and try one of their signature cocktails. The \"Fresh off the Boat\" with hints of coconut and rum went very well with the dishes served.", "Came across this place by accident and I was not disappointed. It's good to see a restaurant that is busy; the only down side was that we waited 45 minutes for a table for 2. I came during brunch but would definitely like to come again to try their dinner.\n\nOn our table we had the tocino silog and the tortang talong. It came with a decent portion of garlic rice, a salad with a sesame dressing and a piece of pineapple (I was lucky enough to get 2 pieces). The food was delicious and I would stop by again for brunch, maybe right when they open next time instead of 1:00pm on a Sunday.\n\nThe reason I couldn't give this 5 out of 5 is the price. Check came out to over $50 for two plates and 2 drinks but then again everything out here is getting more expensive so my complaint is felt all around. I also might be a little biased since I'm Filipino and the price of the brunch dishes are higher than what'cha get. But the food still tasted good.\n\nSadly, the only photo I took was of the drinks we ordered.", "I have been meaning to try this place as soon as they opened. I finally got to go this past weekend and it was everything I wanted it to be. Remember I am saying this as a non--filipino person so I do not mean to offend. The decor was tasteful and their drink menu was extensive. Their cocktails cost anywhere from 11-13 dollars depending on what is in it. The use a lot of dried fruit in their drinks which is great because those flavors slowly infuse into your drink giving you different levels as time goes by. Here are the food items you MUST TRY.\n\n1. Pork Adobo (the second kind with coconut milk) it is different and super flavorful. you will not get that much pork in it so its perfect for 2-3 people to share and have a taste.\n2. Shangai lumpia- SO CRUNCHY, SO GOOD, with actual filling you can taste\n3. RIBS- this is under the apps list, but theres quite a few ribs on there for you to try\n4.

I've been a fan since you we're at the pop up on Mission. Finally got the chance to enjoy their amazing Filipino food!\n\nLet me preface this review with the fact that I love the food so much, I rented a car just to eat here! The new FOB Kitchen space is pretty cool, but mister importantly the food hasn't changed! I would describe their food as Elevated Filipino, everything was cooked perfect, the flavors were deep & rich but stayed true to Filipino taste but with better cuts of meat, proper cooking techniques and carefully curated salad & side dishes.  We loved everything we ordered!

This place is cute inside and out! Very thoughtful decor and island vibes. Music was jammin'. Menu is limited but I think it changes weekly? Although we came for brunch, if they had sinigang or kare-kare on there, I would've fasho ordered those. Instead, I opted for the adobo fried rice. My friends ordered pork belly silog and tocino. Granted every province cooks Filipino food differently so it's hard to be too critical. The most important part is that the flavor was there. Their chicken skin (or chicharron) was fire too, whatever seasoning they sprinkle on it is magic. The halo halo was satisfying but it didn't have the red bean or ube concentrate like usual. Their drinks are hella good though!\nOne thing I wish they had was fish sauce. HAHA. They do have their homemade sauce but nothing beats some fish sauce to add to a Filipino dish!\n\nI would definitely come back and revisit. Maybe this time for dinner when I can try a few different items on their menu.", "A new take on Filipino food and it seems to be becoming more popular. Last night was their first night of service and it couldn't have gone better. Service was on point and very friendly.\n\nA lot of shareable dishes on the menu. The shanghai lumpia were good and different than your usual at home lumpia.\n\nJanice's ribs were a hit around the table. A bit messy to eat by hand but that's the best way.\n\nThe pancit was tasty and was devoured by everyone. It was light and not too greasy like some other places that I've had it.\n\nThe pork adobo was the first time I've had it with pork was a bit too tangy for me. The sinigang baboy was a bit too tart for my tastes.\n\nI didn't have any drinks but they looked good.

I went back and only ordered mussels this time. I was dying to try the Bisque and I was not disappointed.

Dipping with their perfectly crusty french bread, I made sure I got all of it.  This was by far the best thing on the menu, even better than the Funghi which I raved about last time. (I ordered that again as well)\n We ordered a special that night that was similar to the Parma, the mussels were broiled instead of steamed (so it was dry, no broth) with melted parmesan cheese, basil, and tomatoes. It was a little heavy for my taste, but I could see how others would like it. We also ordered the Acadian with the gumbo sauce, shrimp, and andouille and it was delicious as well.  The sauce was creamy and they are not shy with the shrimp and sausage.\n The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. And with prices like these I can't wait to go back and try the Maine and Italiano!", "Tried the UES outpost of Flex last night and really enjoyed it.  The place was packed, but managed to land an 8pm reservation with only a couple hours notice.  Vibrant, lively scene with people crowded around the bar up front and a full, well mixed crowd filling the dining room tables in back.  Complimentary sparkling water is a nice touch and a cost saver.  Service was extremely nice and helpful, though a bit spacey at times--forgot that he had already taken our order and came back ten minutes later to explain/suggest different mussels plates, brought our bottle of wine but took away our wine glasses, etc.--I think he was just a little slammed with tables though.  The food was all excellent:  Thai Mussels lived up to the hype, perfectly cooked in an absolutely amazing broth that put each and every last piece of bread to use.  East/West Coast oysters were fresh, briny and delicious.  I had the Swordfish special which was cooked perfectly and still juicy served over an ethereal crab-potato hash.  My GF had the whole grilled Dorade with asparagus and spinach--also excellent.  Double espressos in lieu of dessert (though the table next to us got the homemade donuts, which looked AMAZING!).  Really a great dinner, fun atmosphere and pleasant service.  Will definitely go back.", "flex mussels was a lot of fun.\n\nbest parts: mussels are ENORMOUS. huge, genetically modified maybe, enormous lil guys. this is a big plus. also - the beer was fabulous. i had a special canadian beer on tap  - they have a lot of specialty canadian options as well as the fresh white wines you might want to pair with your seafood, as well as whatever else.\n\ni had the 'classic' - garlic, butter, white wine. it was fabulous and an ample portion. my friends got the thai which was also delicious and flavorful. they keep the bread coming for sopping purposes and the service was attentive but not claustrophobic - keeps it more casual than the stylish interior might initially make you think.  im still going to check dressy bc the crowd was decidedly more post-work than down home casual.\n\nthey are very croweded but do opentable so its no sweat to get  a res, which you'll need.", "Heaven in a little shell.\n\nI'd been wanting to try Flex Mussels for ages simply because of the name. When I finally convinced my boyfriend to take me there, we were blown away. Both of us are seafood maniacs, so I was skeptical, but the food was nothing short of amazing. We had a starter but I don't recall which. Clearly, the superstar of the evening was the mussels. And they have a gazillion different sauces that compliment the mussely goodness, not to mention the fact that they bring you the mussels in a pot. I love it! I had the parma mussels, which were quite rich and straight up my alley.  The french fries were a delight as well, hand cut and perfectly salted. The portions were incredibly generous. For dessert, we had the house made dough nuts and an additional dessert that had been added to the menu that night....baked alaska with watermelon sorbet! YUM!!!\n\nI was so thrilled to find this place that I took my mom (a mussel virgin at the time) when she came to visit, and she loved it too, of course! Wonderful service, a relaxed setting, and the best damn mussels I've ever had in my life. What could be better than that?", "Very solid neighborhood spot.  If you're a mussels fan, you certainly can't go wrong as the variety is pretty outrageous.  I'm boring...tend to stick to classic but when I'm feeling 'wild' I'll get the Italiano for some red sauce and calamari.  Always good service and kudos to the nice wine list.

Located in the San Francisco Ferry building, with an awesome view of the bay.  There is always a long wait, since many of the tourists and business people from the Financial district will be fighting for their fresh assortment of oysters.  Hog Island features some of the freshest and highest quality seafood, served with their own dipping sauce (vinegar, pesto).  The assortment and choices of oyster species, clearly differentiates them from anywhere else.  If this is your first trip, be sure to try at least three different types of oysters and refrain from cocktail sauce!  This place is pricey(I spent $36 for lunch), but worth every penny.  \nBe sure to save room for their clam chowder, which best described as a huge bowl of steamed clams in broth.  The amount of fresh clams (in the shell) is enough to share with 3 people(if you are feeling generous).", "As an SF native, there are not a lot of super touristy places that are worth going to if you're a local. Hog Island is one of few exceptions to this rule. The line moves pretty quickly and the guy who manages it is super efficient. Street parking is easy and the view of the bay can't be beat.\n\nOysters are always fresh and delicious (we love the Sweetwater and Kumamoto), clam chowder is the best I've had (love that theirs is a lot less thick than every other clam chowder out there), and the patio seating is perfect for our dog, especially when it's not freezing and foggy here in the city. If you don't know about the grilled oysters, especially the chipotle bourbon one...you need to know! We order that every time and it never disappoints (Tip: dip the complimentary bread into the sauce and I promise your life will change). Tip for the tourists: pack for dressing in layers when you visit SF and always bring a jacket with you no matter the season. You'll thank me later.\n\nWhenever we have friends visiting from out of town, this is one of the places we take them. They all say it's cold, but they go home happy.", "As intimidating as the line might look at this place, it actually lives up to the hype. Everything is so tasty, so fresh, so delicious! Between my bf and I, we ordered clam chowder, the rustic seafood stew, and a dozen oysters. Sometimes,  I look back at the pictures of the food here, and I start salivating immediately.\n\nThe clam chowder here is not your typical goopy thick chowder; it is more of a milky soup. Nevertheless, the portions of clams in it was very generous, and the soup itself was so sweat from the clams, and mildly but not overpoweringly sweet.\n\nThe rustic seafood stew is one of their signature dishes, and for good reason. The portions are very generous, and there was not a single drop of edible food left in that bowl once we were done. Don't forget to dip some bread in there. It's a great way to soak up the yummy soup.\n\nThis place is called Hog Island Oyster Co, so I don't think there's much need to explain the oysters. The waiting staff are super friendly, and will explain the many variety of oysters to you. The restaurant seems better suited for smaller groups, as opposed to bigger groups. Despite the queue outside, they are very efficient in getting people seated.", "Surprisingly great seafood.\n\nWith its location, this could just be a tourist trap, but the food was legit. Wait was only about 15 minutes on a Monday, however it probably gets quite busy on the weekend.\n\nThe raw oysters were some of the best I've had in the West Coast. The sampler had an awesome assortment  of flavors and sizes. The oysters were perfectly shucked and ridiculously fresh tasting. Even the tiny oysters packed quite a punch.  I also really enjoyed their mussels with pesto cream sauce and a side of fries. The fries were perfectly crispy and very flavorful and the mussels were delicious and once again, super fresh tasting. The cream sauce was quite good and a nice change of pace from more typical flavors used with shellfish. Plenty of bread was ordered to consume it all up.\n\nNice view, convenient location, great food. The only knock against it is that it is a bit on the pricey side, but food was good enough to feel the experience overall was worth the premium.", "Came to the Ferry building amidst COVID and there's definitely fewer stores open and less people walking around. On the positive side most people are wearing masks when they're not eating!\n\nI put my name on the waitlist through Resy once you're less than a mile or two away and it gave me an estimated time of 2 hour wait on a Saturday morning for a table of 5. The waits are pretty long as they're seating fewer parties in order to maintain proper social distancing measure with all parties more than 6 feet apart. They seem very attentive to staying clean and give all guests hand sanitizer as you wall in, and they wipe down the tables very thoroughly with cleaning spray between parties.\n\nThe clam chowder here is absolutely amazing and uses fresh clams in a broth that is on the lighter/thinner side vs some of the heavier clam chowders I have tried that have lots of heavy cream. The chowder includes Manila clams, potatoes, and bacon. The oysters here are very fresh and tasty and I would highly recommend the chipotle bourbon grilled oysters as well which is topped with a butter, bourbon, brown sugar, garlic, and chipotle sauce.

Temaki is a style of hand roll sushi in which Nami Nori specializes in. Located in NYC West Village on Carmine St, Nami Nori is a must try spot if you're looking for a new type of sushi experience. We were fortunate enough to snag a same day reservation for 5 people and when we arrived, we were promptly seated at the chef's table (recommended). At the table, you are given the option to select from a pre determined set or order a la carte. Personally, I recommend selecting a set and then adding on a piece or two that appeals to you. We opted for the Signature Set which included:\n\n- Tuna Poke, Crispy Shallot\n- X.O. Scallop, Tobiko, Lemon\n- Coconut Shrimp, Green Curry, Lime, Cilantro\n- Spicy Sea Bass, Daikon, Perilla, Chojang\n- Cucumber Black Sesame, Shiso, Plum\n\nAdditionally, we added on a few rolls including:\n\n- Toro, Caviar, Scallion\n- Lobster Tempura, Yuzu Ailoi, Fris\u00e9e\n- Salmon, Cucumber\n- Spicy Crab Dynamite\n\nEvery piece was so delicately prepared and beautiful and when you take a bite, an absolute flavor explosion.

Seating wise, it is mostly bar seating along with just a few small tables in there but the turn around time seemed pretty fast so we were ok with waiting at dinner time. Everyone was super friendly from as soon as you walk in. The hostess was nice and attentive and the chefs behind the bar were cool. Everyone seemed pretty happy in there!\n\nAs soon as we sat, our server explained the menu quickly and we were ready to order. They are known for the house made temaki crispy nori shells but I like my traditional nori so we ordered the shishito peppers to share and I had the Salmon & tomato, XO scallop, uni+caviar, baby shrimp temakis. Every single bit was a small bite of sushi heaven! The raw sushi was fresh with great flavor and same goes with the toppings. I really enjoyed every bite and can't wait to go back!", "Food 2/5\nI like the presentation of the so called hand rolls with little wooden piece. But since it's not fully wrapped so when you take a small bite it will fall apart immediately. Kinda made it hard to eat. But what disappointed me the most is the taste. We got all the signature rolls, uni, lobster tempura and toro. The quality of the fish was very mediocre and the sauce was way too strong and didn't really go well with other garnish. The combination wasn't that innovative after all.\n\nEnvironment/Service 4/5\nGood vibe and nice decor. Feels more like a boutique store than a restaurant. The service was really nice.

We were sat outdoors and the staff was very attentive, cordial, and explained everything. Ordering was easy(just had to google some names to know what it was) and the wait for food was very little.\n\nThe quality of the food was great, as well as the presentation.

If you don't want to get a predetermined set, you can make your own combination.\n\nOverall, great experience. Some may say it is pricey, but the quality of the food, the presentation, and the attention of the staff make it definitely worth it. Worth visiting, it's a unique experience! I'd just recommend reserving as space is limited and walk-ins are subject to a wait.", "As a vegetarian with a meat-eating partner, sushi is something we rarely, if ever, get to do. We started with apps: shishito peppers and the furikake fries. The sauces were AMAZING- I will be trying to recreate the miso honey at home and strongly recommend the getting the mayo alongside the fries. I got the vegan takami set (naturally) and was glad to have more variety than just cucumber and avocado - the tofu chimichurri was a surprise hit (but really, they were all good).\n\nService was seamless.

The calamari was very hot and there were five pieces. The batter was crispy while the squid was soft and chewy. The yuzu sauce is really good but slightly spicy. The chef's set was decent. We had 5 hand rolls and none of them really stood out to me. My boyfriend liked the salmon with onion, cream and chives the best. I feel like all of the handrolls tasted the same or similar. However, I really liked the ice cream, but I wish they used matcha ice cream and then added the tiny bit of vanilla cream instead of the other way around. Overall, good experience, but I wouldn't go back.", "This spot is fantastic. Came here and felt very safe with the level of health precautions in place.

For meals, I really liked my cinnamon apple ravioli with duck ragu and my brother-in-law really liked his housemade tonnarelli with prawns and olives.

If my review was based on food and atmosphere alone, I would have given 4 stars. But while the busboys were great -- kept our water filled and served our plates formally -- the waiter was pretty indifferent about our presence, had us sit there for 15 minutes before he brought us our menus, and if we needed anything we had to get his attention while he was standing (not working) behind the bar.", "First of all I have to give a huge thank you to the entire staff, our group came for a birthday and after 6/8 glasses of wine each we completely lost track of time.

Meat quality has always been great here, and the servings are large portions in fact. I  had a great time dining, its was my first Korean BBQ of the year.   The service we got was great and our host was attentive, even gave us refill on the banchan(side dish) when asked.  Meat was very well marinated and was very flavorful didn't need much dipping sauce that they provide.\n\nGalbi- Must have.  \nBulgogi-Cant go wrong with this ever!\nChadol- I love the marbles slices it was amazing.\nKimchi Dolsot Bibim-Bap- yes get this it was really delicious, highly recommend.  \nJapchae- was really delicious\n\nGenwa is one of my top list for KBBQ, always bookmarked and often recommend to friends/family from out of town.", "This place doesn't disappoint!\n\nGenwa is definitely not your traditional Korean bbq restaurant. It is very nice, a bit upscale, and their meats are of high quality.\n\nTheir banchan are my favorite!! They have at least 20 sides that they give you (which is a lot) and they're all great. Whenever you ask for more they give you a bigger side of it as well. Course A is perfect for two people! It comes with two meats, sundubu soup, japchae noodles, and bibimbap. So much food and all so good!!\n\nService is great ! Even when they're extremely busy they are attentive and cook your meat. They have valet parking for $3.50 and you can try finding street parking as well.", "So many side dishes!! So small and cute, it was amazing to see all the different varieties! I love trying and tasting a small bite of each kind and it's perfect to share with the table.\n\nThe ambiance and decor inside is really nice and fancy. The parking was easy, there was a parking structure and we walked in from behind the restaurant. The wait wasn't too long since we made a reservation but it was a pretty popular place to dine on a Friday night. I saw that they have a separate room for larger parties, looked like someone was celebrating for a rehearsal dinner or engagement party.\n\nWe had a party of four and we were seated in a nice booth. We ordered a combo and the staff helped us cook all the meat perfectly. They were very attentive and helpful. It's not always the same person cooking but there was always some one preparing our meat for us. Everything was delicious!\n\nThis is not a regular Korean barbecue place, it's not smoky inside and you won't need to worry about your hair and clothes smelling like kbbq. Highly recommend!", "$$$ Be ready to fork out some money when dining here. Pay for parking AND a premium price for their food. I spent $63 (before gratuity & parking fee) just for myself. All I ordered was bulgogi, bowl of rice, & a hot tea. Granted, they do give you an abundant assortment of bonchon.\nThe meat was marinated with a tasty house marinade and most of the bonchon were good. I appreciated the bowl of salad they gave me. I did not appreciate how the server dumped all of the meat onto the grill as soon as it arrived. I don't like overcrowding my grill as the meat doesn't cook with an even char. Honestly, I felt that by her doing so...she was rushing me to hurry and finish my meal so she could turn the table around more quickly for a potentially larger party.\nOverall, I would probably only come back during their weekday lunch hours as the prices seem a bit more reasonable and I'd request a different server. There are just so many other decent Korean BBQ restaurants to choose from where their food as well as service far surpasses Genwa's. Upon finishing my meal, my server never even came out to thank me nor say bye. I believe all these seemingly minor details go into the makings of a 5-star restaurant.", "One of the larger polished KBBQ spots in L.A., Genwa has a lively, fun atmosphere. One of the first things you'll notice is the aroma of delicious marinated meats sizzling over live fire. The place is no frills in terms of design, but it's clean, and delicious.\n\nBefore covid, Genwa always had a celebratory vibe. Great for celebration and large groups. Just be aware that you will leave this spot smelling like.... BBQ.\n\nGenwa has higher quality selections of meat than many other Korean BBQ spots.  Also good selection of Soju.\n\nA very good spot for anyone who is hesitant or hasn't tried Korean BBQ. Quality of meats will make this a pretty universally great choice. Sides are pretty decent too.\n\nAs for service, staff is attentive and there to help to ensure that the meat is grilled properly.", "There are so many Korean bbq places in LA it's overwhelming.  We chose this one because I saw a picture of the 17 banchan.  Note - the banchan is in small bowls the size of my tiny hand.  However, I'm a light eater so it suffice for me but for hungry people it won't be enough.  \n\nWe ordered course A for 2 people - the kalbi was delicately soft and marinated well but the pork belly was tough.  Loved the tofu soup and salad  and japchae.  I agree with other reviews that it was not spicy which again was fine with me because I don't have a high tolerance for spicyness.  \n\nWe didn't experience the long wait time because we went on a Tuesday at 5:30pm and self parked in the covered lot behind the building on S. Mansfield Avenue.  It was very quiet - only 5 other parties at that time., I agree to make a reservation with them online for the busy weekends and times.", "always a wonderful experience...

The space is small and there are maybe 5-6 tables, with the kitchen right across the way.\n\nWe shared a few things, all of which were the bomb.\nShredded potatoes and peppers - simple stir fried potatoes with peppers, cut in long strands. With their house chili oil it was amazing\nLaphing - hard to describe what this tastes like, but imagine a savory jelly soaked in garlic, soy sauce, onion and vinegar. Slippery and very umami delicious with their house chili oil.\nYak butter tea - an acquired taste that wasn't for us. It's like drinking salty cream, but is wonderful for cutting through heat.\n\nWe didn't get their momos, but if you do (and even if you order any other food), SLATHER IT WITH THEIR HOUSE CHILI OIL!! Aside from Hwa Yuan in Chinatown, their chili oil is probably one of the best I've had. Really smoky and has lots of depth.", "My hubby and I stumbled upon this place after our friends last minutes cancelled the homemade pizza night on us. We were really bumped about the last minutes plan change because we spent two days planning for this!! But...... We changed our mind after we had our first bite of the Beef Shak Trak!!! The balance of the spiciness and saltiness, and the amounts of beef and veggies are just perfect!! The beef were so tender and melt in your mouth!\n\nWe also ordered Lhasa Fried Noodle with beef. Omg.....I never knew that lomein noodle can be made in such delicious blend with this unique Tibetan spice!!!\n\nThe hand drawn noodle soup, Thenthuk is a must try!!! I have never seen a flat noodle like this soft, tender and chewy. The taste is light but is a perfect match for the spicy Beef Shak Trak!! My hubby usually does not like soup noodle but even he had two bowls!!!\n\nIn the end, we are so happy how the night has turned out! We spent average $8 per dish and found our new favorite restaurant in JH!!!\n\n:)", "I love this restaurant so much, I'm not exaggerating when I say I come here once or twice every week!! My top 3 favorite dishes are: Phaksha Gotsel Ngoema (garlic shredded pork), Phaksha Siphen Ngoenma (mildly spicy sliced pork), and the Lhasa Fried Noodle. They are each flavorful and filling, and really great comfort foods after long days at work.\n\nI have also tried their vegetable and beef Momos which are good but not something I crave for. The Momos are filling as well so I tend to not order them to save room for the other dishes. Their Tsak Sha Dang Ka Sha Ngoe Ma (beef with mushrooms) is also worth a try, although my boyfriend mentions that their beef tastes a little different.\n\nOverall, very affordable for such delicious food and the staff is also friendly!", "A restaurant like Phayul makes me feel so grateful to live in NYC.  (What I think is) authentic Tibetan cuisine just within a 10 min subway ride from Manhattan.  We picked Phayul based on the NYT critics pick in Jackson Heights which were very few to my surprise.  Two of us got so excited and went overboard and ordered beef tongue (extremely tender, one of the best beef tongues around), beef dumpling (again one of the best dumplings I've had with abundant peppercorns), friend noodle (excellent), and tripe.  Tripe was very tasty but as expected it's a bit acquired taste in such as large portion.  For a party of two, 2-3 dishes is more than plenty.  I'd recommend to go with a group of 4 to be able to try different dishes.  I can't wait to go back.", "Delicious momos! The texture of the filling and the skin were so perfect. Definitely will get again! I had the steamed beef momos and I can't wait to try different fillings, steamed and fried! Delicious.\nI also 100% recommend the Shak Trak (stir fried beef ) it was so delicious with a healthy serving of saut\u00e9ed veggies. And the sauce was perfect for dipping the plain bun.", "Phayul is a wild experience. From going up sketchy steps covered in crumpled newspapers to sitting in the actual kitchen it's definitely a fun time. Tables are limited. Food is very cheap for the price. Quality of food varies though. Some stuff like the homemade pork momo to the spicy beef appetizer is off the charts good. Don't order anything that remotely seems Americanized. Phayul is what makes the diversity of Queens so great.", "I would never expect a little gem in the wall would taste as good as this place. The food was seasoned very well and the one woman show of a waitress did an amazing job tending to all the tables she had.\n\nWe ordered their baby bok choy, half portion of fried meat momo's and another half portion of the veggie fried momo's.

To start, the Guinness brown bread with salted Kerrygold butter is a must; the Mangalitsa pork belly is tender and decadent; and the pillowy potato dumplings are a carb lover's dream. For the main course, we went with the cracked pepper bucatini (incredible) and the bone-in shortrib (a hearty portion that's worth the price and incredibly flavorful).

For dessert, the Meyer lemon bread pudding impresses (seriously I can't wait to go back for it again).\n\nOverall, this spot is chic, delicious and in a great location.

My favorite recommendation was the Orange wine. I had never tried it before but our server highly recommended it when I ordered the muscles. I was so pleasantly surprised with it, perfect pairing.\nMy BF ordered the Fable Burger which he could not stop bragging about and even commented to the staff that it was one of the best burgers in OC, trust me he knows his burgers.\nOur server was fantastic!

Beet agnolotti was light, perfect appetizer, made me want to order several more portions. \"Boxy dumplings\" were similar to gnocchi, but lighter, sauce was heavy, creamy delicious, the kind you want to sop up with bread at the end. Definitely order a solid glass of red wine to go with that. Finally duck confit flatbread, just because it's round doesn't make it a pizza!

They use locally grown Liberty Duck that is also used in the top end restaurants of the Bay area.  They have excellent vegetarian dishes also.  The wine list is also over the top excellent!!!  The house white is perfect.  But if you want to try a very wide range of unusual and very well selected wines from around the world, this is the place.  Can't say enough about this very fine restaurant.  There is a touch of genius happening at Khom Loi.", "Incredibly delicious and artful food, wonderful staff and ambience. Highly recommend the Massaman Curry with short ribs and squash (pro tip: get the sticky rice and shape it into little balls and drop them in to the delicious ambrosia of the sauce). I also love the fried whole rock cod though it is very spicy, be warned. After eating my fill of the fish I end up taking enough home for at least 2 more meals. Pad thai and the lemongrass chicken appetizer really yummy too.

This careful process and that almighty oven shipped from Italy can be observed with longing through the glass-walled kitchen. The dining room also conjures the homeland through Mediterranean-blue murals and furnishings.\nTo top that crust, many pizzas go on to include premium ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes and fior di latte, which arrives several times a week from Italy. Alternatively, deck your pie with a more creative and locally minded blend of embellishments. A choice of appetizers, gourmet salads and luscious desserts round out the menu.", "yelp_reviews": ["Pizzana was so booked on a week-end night that I gave up trying to go to stand and wait for 1 or 2 hours, so one week day evening while driving past, I took a chance and asked at the valet how long the wait was before handing over the car keys. It turned out that 7pm on a Tuesday night is a great time to go, with barely a 10 minute wait for a patio table. The $16 chop salad was full of flavor, Italian salami, and provolone. It was a very hearty savory salad, with chickpeas, avocado, and olives that could easily be a meal for one or is perfect to share with a pizza.\n\nThe classic margherita for $19 was worth every penny for their use of authentic quality ingredients like fio di latte and san marzano dop polpa. The crust was magnificently crisp, with nice chew, and served on a metal tray with holes to allow the hot steam to escape rather than make the crust soggy. The flavors were clean and needed no additions to perk up the pizza. It was large enough for 2 to share and if you had a monster appetite, you would be very full if you could finish it.", "Just stopped by for a quick bite at Pizzana. Featured on \"The Chef Show\" with Chef Roy Choi and Director Jon Favearu--Pizzana offers a true taste of Italian pizza on the Westside. True to Roy Choi's own reviews, Pizzana's combination of high quality pizza dough and whole, simple ingredients makes for a mouth-watering indulgence known as pizza.\n\nTo begin, we were given seats at the Chef's bar--a front row view of the kitchen and wood-fire oven behind glass. Offerings of still and sparkling water were made--just a note, I accepted sparkling, but was charged $7, without a preface of cost from our server.\n\nAside from that, our server was enthusiastic when discussing the different pizzas and attentive to our questions.\n\nWhat I Got: We ordered the Neo Margherita which arrived within 15 minutes. We saw the entire process of assembly, cooking, and preparation for service.\n\nThe pizza was delicate, savory, and a perfect blend\nof creamy and light (from the tomato sauce).\n\nWorth Your Money? $19 for a pizza is a bit steep. But a quality pizza is a quality pizza. Each pizza has 6 slices and can be shared between two--it won't make you too full, but worth a try!", "We started out with the Broccolo Romano. Simple appetizer with broccoli, tomatoes, olives, capers, chilis and breadcrumbs. It's a nice combination.\n\nFor pizza we chose the Cacio E Pepe. I liked the burnt crust and the mozzarella cheese known as Fior di Latte, that's apparently imported from Italy every few days. The rest was ok. I wish there had been more fior di latte on the pizza.\n\nDessert we had the olive chocolate cake and the apple tort. I didn't love the chocolate cake. It tasted a bit generic. The appletort was not bad. I liked it but I wouldn't come back here just for that cake. It was covered in pieces of baked apples and caramels. A little salt on top that sort of worked with the ice cream.\n\nSince the owner is the owner of Sprinkles cupcakes I had higher expectations for the dessert. I wouldn't drive across town to get here but if I'm in the area it's a solid choice.", "Yeah, that was some goooood pizza! I love that they import their stone ground Italian flour, San Marzano tomatoes, and fior di latte (mozzarella) from Italy!\n\nI tried the funghi pizza. It was umami deliciousness. The crust was chewy, tasty, and perfect. Cold leftover slices were even scrumptious. All the pizzas on the menu sound and look tantalizing! Can't wait to try others, and also their salads!\n\nMy one complaint is I wish that they served their wine in proper stemware. It would just elevate the experience. I'm fine with the casual cool ambiance they're going for (denim napkins, jeans, placemat menus), but I really wasn't a fan of the cheap drinkware. I had a sparkling wine, iced tea, water, and espresso. I didn't care for any of the vessels they came in. Don't mess with my beverage experience.\n\nValet is available during lunch for $8.", "This was such a cute little place for a date night. We were seated at the bar (without a reservation on a Wednesday evening) overlooking the kitchen where you can see all the pizzas being made and baked. It was very cool to be able to see the pizza we ordered being baked right in front of our eyes.\n\nWe ordered the fried artichoke for appetizer and the Margherita Al Crudo for our pizza and shared both items. The fried artichoke was very French-fry-like. It tasted like a lot of oil, to be honest, and neither of us could finish that appetizer.\n\nOur pizza was delicious. It was very heavily topped with arugula and prosciutto (almost too heavily topped, but I shouldn't complain about extra toppings ;) ).\n\nThe crust was delicious, but it was fairly soggy and thin in the middle and each slice fell apart as we were eating due to the weight of the toppings.\n\nHowever, the tomato sauce was perfectly seasoned and not too heavy. If the crust had been a bit sturdier and maybe the toppings not as heavy, it would have been a perfect pizza.", "Recently tried Pizzana in Brentwood and would go back again!!

Sure, it's one of those quintessential SF restaurants, it's always on Zagat's top 50 most popular restaurants in SF, and people gush over it like vodka on Britney Spears.  I tried to like this place, I really did, but it just didn't float my boat.\n\nOther than the nice view of the bay bridge, I didn't get that special \"razzle-dazzle\" feeling in my loins that really special restraunts (and cheap underwear) provide.  Make no mistake, the food is well prepared and tastes fine, but I was not impressed by the complexity of the dishes or the level of service... especially at this price point.  Boulevard's a busy place and I felt like a leper during most of my visit as waitstaff seemed too preoccupied catering to the older gentlemen in suits or to the private dining room.  Well dammit!  Lepers have feelings too!!!  To be fair, one of the kindly busboys took pity on me and offered me bread and water...\n\nAnyway, I left Boulevard somewhat disappointed and insecure.

Some people just can't handle alcohol at lunch.\n\nBad behavior aside, our holiday lunch was glorious.  The restaurant is so beautifully decorated in art nouveau and was tricked out for the holidays in a spectacular fashion.\n\nGiven that we were such a large group, we managed to try everything on the menu, with the crab/grapefruit salad and the lobster bisque as standouts.  The bavette steak was the clear favorite of the entree choices but I stuck with the wonderful sole which was cooked perfectly and napped with a delicious sauce.  I loved the crumble dessert as well as the pot de creme.  \n\nThanks again to Boulevard for a wonderful event.

The pork chop (Berkshire Kurobuta Pork Prime Rib Chop Wood Oven Roasted - Calvados mutsu apple fritto, cold pressed apple miel, poppy seed spaetzle, half moon bay brussel sprouts & Edwards Virginia bacon.

Very nice.\n\nThe weather outside was liquid, it was raining very hard. Still, the place was on a roar.\n\nThey have a variety of seating arrangements.

A 20 minute wait for the appetizers we ordered, then 1 in 4 of the appetizers was cold. We sent it back.  Later, 2 of the 4 entrees were cold to the point you could see the sauce congealed on the fish dish. We sent them back. In the meantime, our dining companions finished their meals. For the second attempt, husband's pork chop came back perfect but my fish was very obviously just reheated.  The fish was way overcooked.  I did not return it only because I was so hungry by that time and the sad meal was dragging on.\n\nWait person was friendly but not attentive. We had to flag down others to get our dishes returned.\n\nManager gave perfunctory apologies with no explanation even though he did discount the total bill for us and gave us free dessert.

Of course they also gave us 2 loaf of bread with a healthy drizzling of garlic and olive oil.  A carafe of the house red was not disappointing either.  Then the main courses of grilled sardines and pork on skewers.  Perfectly done with the right amount of char.

Reservations are a must and likely need to be made weeks in advance. I absolutely love the six seat chefs counter where you get to watch the magic.\n\nAnd the food is magic. It's a mix of comfort food with homemade pasta. It was hard to just pick 4 dishes. All of it was delicious and you kept going back for more. The uni shooter was one perfect bite to start off the meal. The king crab tagliatelle and scallops were fan favorites. The tri-tip steak, with spicy well balanced red and green sauces, was also a hit. We've always been too full for dessert, but I'll plan more ahead next time.

We really loved the pastas (which were perfectly al dente -- no small feat), and I thought the eggplant was absolutely outstanding as well. If there was anything we wouldn't order again, it might be the onion rings (which were very good onion rings, but there's probably an upper limit there) and the involtini (which was very good, but less unique than the other pastas). The hot mess also wasn't my thing, but the rest of the table loved it.

They're on the smaller side, but they're delicious and definitely worth the $3. Next, we got the Garlic Buttermilk Potatoes and Brussel Sprouts. Both were awesome, but the brussel sprouts were a little too salty. Next up was the Twice Cooked Pork. This was noted on the menu as a chef's special but actually ended up being my least favorite item. It was on the spicier side, and the flavor didn't wow the both of us. The shrimp chips were also very hard and almost stale-tasting! Last up was Pici, With Chew. This was definitely delicious, but we were disappointed at the portion size. Giant definitely has smaller, shared plates, but we both got about 2-3 bites from this pasta.\n\nService was good from everyone, and our bill ended up being only $61 for everything listed above.

We shared the little biscuit with jalape\u00f1o butter, marinated zucchini, Jonah crab salad, and crab tagliatelle. I enjoyed the biscuit and the crab salad.

There is no choice, besides large or small, bone in or bone out. Its nice to just eat and not think. The hot salsa was amazing. The tomatoes and smoke were a perfect combination. The goat feel off the bone, great seasoning.  The tortillas were yummy but I wish they were a bit thinner as I got full right away.

I am salivating at the memory. So their menu is pretty simple...and honestly, I don't really see any reason anyone would come here and not just get a plate of birria. The birria is awesome. The meat is so tender it falls apart on your fork. And it's flavored remarkably well. I can't confess to possessing deep knowledge about how birria is made, but the one here is served with goat meat and a vegetable consomme rather than actual goat stew. I don't know if this is traditional or not, but it works and holy moly I don't care what implications that might hold. This is amaaaaazing.\n\nTo further the amaaaaazing, the birria comes with a variety of toppings (I like to crumple the dried peppers for some spice, add onions, and squeeze in a bit of lime) and fresh tortillas. These fresh tortillas, which you can watch them make as you eat, are very possibly the most delicious fresh tortillas I've ever had and I'm a native Angeleno--no stranger to Mexican cuisine. This place is an all-around shining star in the Chicago food scene.", "I'll be honest and admit I didn't realize the only protein on the menu is goat when I headed to Birrieria Zaragoza. Clearly my Spanish is lacking, lol. I've had goat a few times, so not an unpleasant surprise. The look on my face as I stared at the menu must've called me out as a first timer.\n\nThe young lady at the register offered to assist by making a few suggestions. We opted for a small plate of birria, quesadillas and salsa de molcajete. The salsa has deep rich flavor, but is HOT! Be sure to choose the appropriate spice level. As for the birria, I really enjoyed it. No gaminess, perfectly tender and robust flavor. I now understand the menu is limited because they've mastered the goat and they know it. Check them out if you're in the area or are up for traveling to try something a little different.", "Hands down the best birria in the city! This place is a gem, I've been going there for years since it's in the neighborhood, it is family owned and you will find the whole family working there on a daily basis.

The goat is so tasty and tender that it's almost a crime. The sauce/stew that it is cooked in is so flavorful and the meat just soaks all of that up. It's simple dining, as the goat is just about all they have on the menu, but the goat is all that matters. We had the boneless, but next time I think I will go for the bone-in to get even more flavor. The dining room is small, but the staff is super friendly. We met the owner and she was so sweet. She gave us a sample of their roasted chiles to take home. I just recently used them in some enchiladas that I made and the taste of the chiles was right on point.", "This place is a treasure.  A goddamn national treasure.  \n\nThe goat exceeds the hype and makes the journey worthwhile.  It is so tender and savory.  Get it in a bowl of consomme so you can enjoy the soup, too.

I think it's presented in such a way that one may savor each bite, and that is very enjoyable. The French onion soup may not have had much onion in it, but was satisfying on the cheese side. HG's Monkfish special tasted meaty - highest praise from a carnivorous couple. Our waiter sold me on the lamb as a \"winter entree\"... then maybe it should have included some stick-to-your-bones starch instead of an odd chestnut pairing... well, it is California in the winter.\nWe were full enough not to want dessert, but our waiter still brought out a little bag of Bouchon Bakery brownies with a candle for my birthday - very sweet since it seems to be the policy in the area just to warmly congratulate you.\nI'm including this bad photo of me because it really does look like I'm in France - nice job Bouchon!", "Stunned to report that Thomas Keller's Bouchon was a huge disappointment.  While we didn't expect French Laundry, we thought this would be an above average French bistro, with unique flavors, creatively made sauces, unusual pairings and more.  Instead, EVERY course was thoroughly unoriginal -- and soaked in butter, no less!  Even dessert failed the grade; despite the outstanding Bouchon Bakery next door, our lemon tart was truly unmemorable and no better than average. While our experience was pleasant enough thanks to an outstanding waiter, we were sorely disappointed with each new dish, and frankly fear our next cholesterol checks as a result.  Our respect for Thomas Keller has declined dramatically because of Bouchon, and we'll likely avoid the majority of his restaurants in the future.", "After having a great experience at Bouchon Las Vegas a few years ago, decided to make a special trip to try out Bouchon Yountville!

The salmon was very smokey and fresh. It was presented in a jar with a layer of butter on top. It was served over some toasted baguette. The head waiter even brought us some extra toast and the staff helped us remove the butter on top!\n\nThe main course was the croque madame and it was tasty. Croque madame is a ham and cheese sandwich with a sunny-side up egg on top served with a side of steak frites. The sandwich was decent with a piece of cheese in between the ham.\n\nThe steak frites tasted best hot!\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the pot de creme.

I could live in the bakery and never get tired of eating their finely crafted desserts.\n\nThe menu here is never constant, but a few of my to-die-for items are the filet mignon and fresh oysters from British Columbia (the freshest!

Sorry, no photos -- I was too busy enjoying my dessert.\n\nObviously, I give the tart a solid 5 stars. The sandwich? Maybe a 3.5? The egg salad was tasty enough -- in particular, I enjoyed the mustardy flavor and consistency -- and the presentation was super cute; however, my slices of bread were dry and a bit flavorless. The sandwich definitely has potential but ended up looking better than it tasted and at $10 a pop, my expectations were higher.

Sweet, but subtle. The toasted bread added a wonderful touch to the fluffiness of the egg. (Apparently they've stopped toasting their bread, which I do find weird and will have to revisit.)\n- Pork Katsu - Delicious. Bulldog sauce definitely rivals those of Japan. The katsu itself is juicy, crispy, and satisfies each craving.\n\nOverall, you should try this place at least once. It's a perfect place for a morning snack and coffee. Don't go expecting to fulfill a serious appetite. However, if you do, be willing to drop a few bucks  cause each sandwich is about ~ 10 bucks.", "I used to love this place and I can feel the passion of these chefs from their small plates. Now they decided to turn the restaurant into a very expensive McDonald's. It opens until 4pm but only sells food via takeout window after 2pm. That means no more dining in the restaurant after 2, and you wouldn't see the beautiful plating of their food any more. Instead, their sell you food in paper cups and boxes and you have to wait quite a long time on a very windy street. It is good for the owners to save money on labor, and time on food preparation but where is the passion and love guys? Using paper cups and boxes are also bad for the environment. Success only belongs to hardworking people who don't cut corners and I will never eat a $15 sandwich in my car any more.", "Konbi is one of those LA spots that you should probably expect an hour (plus) wait for. I am not one for waiting, so I defiantly said no to my partner while waiting in line and came back early the next day.\n\nThe space is tiny and adorable. About 10 seats at a low bar overlooks the kitchen area. There are probably just as many cooks as there are guests. This place is known for there sandwiches and croissants, so we tried a little bit of both.\n\nThe egg salad sandwich was pretty good. Crusts cut off and whole soft boiled eggs cut into the egg-salad make this sandwich a little bit more special than your typical egg salad. It was a tad bit heavy on the vinegar for my taste, but great nonetheless. The croissants were moist and tasty. Usually I think croissants taste like paper, but these were the real deal. Apparently they only make a few batches per day, and once they are gone - that's it!\n\nOverall this spot is a cute cafe with some nice menu items. If there were no line, I would certainly stop by for a croissant and one of their tasty sandwiches. I would just have to learn how to wake up in time!", "Came here after I got swept up with the hype of these Japanese sandwiches.\n\nOmelette Sandwich- basically like a piece of fluffy tamago sandwiched between bread. Bread itself was buttery but wish they had taken off the crust of the end pieces of the bread. This one was flavorful and definitely a unique flavor that I would say, was worth the time and price to try.\n\nEgg salad- this was tasted like a really good egg salad sandwich. Nothing too special, and honestly not that memorable...but I guess, how memorable could an egg salad be? I would pass on this sandwich\n\nEggplant Katsu- eggplant breaded with bread crumbs, with a cabbage salad. This one was unique and well, and tasted really good!

Mel has been talking about opening Kubeh for as long as I've known her, and to see this dream turn into reality, fills my heart with so much joy. Although the menu is inspired from places I've never been, Melanie has outed years of research and training into keeping it uniquely simple.

So good and fresh. We had fresh melon surbe for dessert, also amazing. So, don't miss this place.", "Truly one of the best meals and dining experiences ever.

Distinct flavors and textures popping in one simple dish of pork belly, beans, eggs, and cabbage.  It is worth the visit simply for this appetizer!  \n\nEverything else was of a very high quality, the kind of thing I always find when in a restaurant headed by a talented successful chef.  I ended with sweet potato doughnuts, which I cannot adequately describe; suffice it to say that I felt that each element of that dish was perfectly executed.  \n\nTake the time to go to the Red Rooster!", "This joint will knock your socks off!!! Upon arrival the vibe and tunes get you groovin' and ready for an incredible take on some Harlem staple eats. The decor and ambiance  is spot on; however the service is on a completely other level!

We were a party of four on Saturday and ordered Uptown guacamole, cornbread, chicken and waffles, Crispy bird sandwich, Lennox burger, Shrimp and grits, Mac & greens.

For starters, diners can enjoy a delicious bread basket served with olive oil and/or balsamic vinaigrette. The menu contains many different options for guests of all varieties. I ordered the penne alla vodka and was very satisfied. The sauce was flavorful and the pasta a good texture--al dente.

My favorite dish is the rigatoni but I believe they change up the dish during different seasons. Usually it was in a white sauce with mushrooms and sausage but most recently they had mushrooms, spinach, garlic and olive oil, still delicious but light. I would also suggest the mussels and penne with vodka.\n\nThe prices are reasonable and quality is consistent but not somewhere I would go out of the way for unless I had friends from out of town.", "The draw to Gigino is definitely the view. In warmer months, sitting outside is surely your best bet, and I can see how this would be a great spot to bring out of town guests. I stopped by here for lunch recently and tried their prix-fix menu. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't revolutionary either. The purgatory soup was pretty tasty but a little too heavy on onions. Meanwhile, my risotto was in desperate need of salt/more cheese. Adding it after the fact wouldn't have helped, as the flavor really needed to be absorbed into the rice.\n\nMy favorite part, believe it or not, was the marinara-topped potato chips that arrived with my bread. I wonder if the food on their regular menu is better than what they offer for prix-fix. If that's true, that isn't the way to draw customers back after an initial visit.

The ikura don was so comforting, TONS of nutrient-dense, \"gold star\" nutrition esp. if you're on a journey for sacred (yet local) foods.  \n\nAlthough I live in Marin, getting to Village Sake would be well-worth crossing a bridge, etc. We were able to be sat immediately outside under heat lamps, staff was very conscientious given we were gluten-free (swapped soy sauce for GF tamari immediately). Were I hosting anyone from Japan (or anywhere else for that matter), Village Sake would be a \"must visit\" on the local tour. Because we were next to the street (it was raining), there was a moment of second-hand smoke from the outside, but it did not detract much from the meal. Plus a fun, diverse, hip playlist of music.", "Love this place in Fairfax. If you're looking for Sushi only I wouldn't come here since their selection (although tasty) consist of more basic rolls and not large elaborate rolls like you might find at a sushi spot.  What they specialize in is small plates and appetizers that are all amazing. You can't go wrong with any of them but a few of my favorites are the Japanese pancake, takoyaki and the Hamachi Kama. The wait list can be a bit scary on the weekends but the food is worth it.", "Tried this place after hearing rave reviews from others and was terribly disappointed. Arrived at ~5:15, got a seat outside immediately.\n\nOrdered:\nDaishichi sake - Good flavor, not warm enough (3/5)\nShima aji nigiri - awful. Not fresh, has that weird fishy flavor, unpleasant texture (1/5)\nAji nigiri - Not good but not as bad as the shima aji. Fishy flavor returns (2/5)\nMaguro nigiri - The most passable thing we had besides the sake. Still not good for the price. Weird texture. (3/5)\nSmoked hamachi tataki - Tasted and felt like thick slices of smoked ham or bologna or something. Came with 3 pieces, ate 1 each, sent the third back. The sauce was the only decent part of this, and it was still thin and unimpressive. (1/5)\nKaisen futo - who knows? Tastes like a lox and shmear. Had lettuce or something on it? Came with 5 pieces, couldn't finish it. (1/5)\n\nI would hope that this was just an off night for this place but I wouldn't return here after this meal.", "Hands down, the best Japanese restaurant in Marin now.\n\nIt's super popular, so use their website and get in line for a table before coming. Otherwise, you will be waiting -- possibly hours -- unless you arrive right before 5pm when they open. Even then, there will be a line, but you should get a seat.\n\nThe asparagus in black sesame sauce is fantastic. We also especially love the black cod,  the maki rolls, and the sake collection. If you saw The Birth of Sake on Netflix, and want to try Tedorigawa sake, this is the place.\n\nThey just opened up a sake bar next door, which has a smaller menu. It's a cool space with great service, and a good option if the main restaurant is full.", "Sigh.  As much as I would love to say STAY AWAY!  These guys deserve all the love they are getting...the food is fantastic (as one might expect given the pedigree of the chef) and the staff is absolutely first rate -- friendly, funny, and efficient.  Everything that should be hot arrives piping hot, the fish is superb, and every bite is delicious.  It's also almost shockingly affordable for what you're getting.  If there is a drawback, it can take a while to get in, but hey, if it was really easy to get in, that would probably be a bad sign...congratulations to Scott, Scott, and the rest of the team for bringing their vision to life so spectacularly...Fairfax is a much happier place for it!", "Looks like the kinks in service have been worked out and after two additional meals here I'm happy to give Village Sake 5 stars. The meal tonight was absolutely incredible - skirt steak skewers - amazing, miso black code - incredible, burdock root tempura - out of this world. I think what made tonight especially amazing was that we ordered dessert. Three of us sampled the donut holes, sticky coffee cake and mochi and they were all exquisite.

The ambiance was hip and upscale. I really did enjoy the decor. The staff was friendly but can be a bit slow at times.\n\nThe food: For appetizer we shared the Tamarine Taste which gave a sampler of shrimp spring rolls, taro root rolls, tea leaf beef and papaya salad. The tea leaf beef was probably the best of the bunch and quite flavorful. Both the rolls were ok but I think I can find equally good ones in an Asian super market. The papaya salad was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nAs for the entrees,  I'm a big steak fan so I wanted to try the Shaking Beef. The beef cubes were well cooked and I did like the flavor of the sauce that it came with. However I felt that the dish fits more in a Chinese restaurant. The watercress and mizuna salad was also a bit on the bitter side. The same thing goes for the Wok Pho Beef Noodles. My friend really liked the Ha Long Bay soup.\n\nI think overall the dishes were good but I just felt that they didn't resemble any of the food I've had in many authentic Vietnamese places in Little Saigon by LA. While I appreciate a bit of fusion, sticking to the roots is still important.", "I recently visited Tamarine in Palo Alto. This Vietnamese place has been on my \"To Try\" list for a long time, so I thought I should check it out.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nBanh Mi Roti --Really amazing, soft roti with a great panang curry dipping sauce. Could have used a bit more spice in the sauce, but it was scrumptious as is.\nChili-Lime Aubergine -- I really love eggplant, so I had high hopes for this dish. It was just ok. I felt that the temperature was a little off and scallion shreds on top had a weird texture.\nPanko Crusted Pressed Tofu --Wow! This dish was absolutely amazing. It was crispy without being oily and came with a great bell paper & eggplant stew.\nCoconut rice -- average.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal. The bartender was really knowledgeable about the food and friendly. I had a great ginger and lemongrass cocktail that was really well-made (but unfortunately the menu online doesn't seem to list it)\n\nI will probably come back. Happy hour ends at 6 pm and its half off all appetizers. The crowd was a little more working professional than I usually hang around, but it was still a nice change.\n\nRating: 3.5 out of 5", "Yelpers are complaining about Tamarine being overpriced, but everything I've gotten here has been so incredible that I don't think it merits that label. Also, there are some good sized dishes on the menu that are labeled as sides or starters that can definitely substitute one of the entrees, and are much less expensive.\n\nYou HAVE to at least start with the Roti. It and its sauce is the tastiest combination of buttery, flaky bread and curry that it really is unavoidable.The Garlic noodles are so simple yet so tasty, and often serve as main dish. The long beans are an incredible addition to any of the menu's meal. The empress rice is delicious, the starter calamari is always fresh and the cilantro sauce is great too. Tartare would be the one thing I would probably not order again - it just didn't stick out in comparison to the rest of this incredible menu.\n\nAs for the mains - Clay Pot Cod and Shaking Beef are amazing. The Cod has this glaze that you just never want to go away, and the Shaking Beef is super tender and is accompanied by some refreshing greens with cherry tomatoes and sliced red onion.\n\nThe service doesn't stand out as incredible, but I haven't found it to be distracting either.\n\nYUM!", "On first impression, this place feels uber-fancy!  But after a few minutes I felt less conscientious in jeans.  We were meeting up with a group of 10.  My friend called ahead for a reservation, and created a 3 course set menu based on their lunch menu.  Many of us were on a budget, and they were nice enough to accommodate us! We did it family style, so we got to taste a bunch of their dishes.  My faves were the Wakame Salad and Salt & Pepper Calamari as starters; Madras Curry Chicken and Curried Long Beans as entrees, and coconut rice.  For desert, we had the chef's choice of a seasonal platter for dessert.  The platter included coconut ice cream, fried bananas fritters and chocolate cake with a berry sauce.\n\nThe company was great, the food was delicious, and the Tamarine mojito was perfect! (Regular mojito recipe but with mango puree twist. YUM!)  I would definitely recommend reservations for a big party!", "5 Stars for this Trendy Resto!

I also liked their tres moles enchiladas, chicken enchiladas smothered in three different types of mole sauces (pablano, royo and verde).

Even in modern Mexico, this is a prized seasonal dish. Usually served during the Fall, when pomegranates and Poblano peppers are at their peak.The \"Nogada\" or walnut sauce is a rich creamy softly sweet concoction that pairs surprisingly well with the deep spicy bite of the poblano pepper. The whole affair is stuffed with ground beef, seasoned with cinnamon, various other spices, and fruits like pears, apples.  Casita's Nogada strays from the traditiion in that it has a decidedly citrusy bent, making the dish that much more magical.\n\nTry their mini-churros too! Made to order and fried to perfection. There's no better in L.A.!", "One of the best Mole I have ever had in my life. The flavor's are great and it compliments the perfectly cooked chicken. This is family style Mexican cooking that taste like my grandma made it. The enchiladas are just like my Mom's. Simple yet full of flavor. Just a tortilla, great sauce, some onions, and cheese.

The Kimchi fried rice and Bibimbap had no options for protein.  I can't believe a vegetable Bibimbap was $17.  The Korean fried chicken wasn't even hot when it came out and we had two orders that came out at different times.  The Kimchi fried rice was the last dish that made it to table.  Everyone was almost done eating by that time.  What was the hold up?  That's the easiest dish to make that we ordered.  \n\nSummary, prices too high, portions too small, food is decent, but I feel like what you're paying for is not the food but the ambiance and presentation.\n\nSorry won't be coming back.", "So glad this place got renovated and a new Korean place replaced what was there before. They have a nice hang out spot with couches and tables in the back patio where you can hang out while waiting to be seated and get some drinks!\n\nThis place is popular and wait is LONG. Get there early and put your name on their waiting list by the door. Also, the place is tiny, so don't expect your parties of 6+ to be seated quickly or together. When I went, it was mostly parties of 2-3.\n\nThey have some unique banchan that I haven't seen before-- quail eggs, sesame oil flavored green onions (?), and tiny shrimps, in additional to the usual kimchi and cucumbers. I love quail eggs and we ate them all pretty quickly. The servers noticed and offered to bring more! A+ service. More quail eggs for me.\n\nI don't think entrees come with rice, as I had to ask them for rice. They have purple rice, which I had never seen in a San Francisco Korean restaurant. I got the kimchi tofu soup, which was deliciously spicy with a LOT of kimchi!\n\nI had to tell my friends about this place (and it's quail eggs!) and will definitely come back.", "The quail egg banchan alone is worth the wait.\n\nOk...so I didn't actually wait because my party arrived promptly at 5:30pm on Saturday and we were seated quickly. But! I woulda waited for dat quail egg.\n\nAnyways, a great early bird dinner was had by all.\nWe ordered:\n-seafood pancake: super brilliant--they add the seafood on top so the pancake stays crispy!\n-fried chicken wings: too sweet for me, but if you like San Tung you'll like these\n-soon dubu: excellent! They only make it at one spice level (read: Asian) but it's perfect. A ton of pork belly and tofu. Really generous portion IMO.\n-kimchi chigae: sour and delicious if that's your jam. I appreciated the freshness.\n\nThey also give you delicious purple rice. So we skipped the bibimbap.\n\nSurrounded by portraits of the great moms out there (Ali Wong, Marge Simpson, lots of Korean Empresses) I felt like I was eating delicious home cooked food whilst enveloped in a clean bougeois hug from my own Asian mom.", "The food at Um Ma was incredible and the place had a fun vibe. Made a reservation via Tock and got a table at the back patio, definitely recommend making a reservation.  We went with the served all day menu and ordered three dishes.\n\n1. Kimchi Fried Rice with Bulgogi - do yourself a favor and try this dish here. They use red rice which added added another dimension to the dish. The meat was very well cooked, the soft poached egg on top added for nice sauce.\n2. LA Style Kalbi - The short ribs were cooked SO well, the sweet garlic soy added a deep umami flavor.\n3. Kimchi Scallion Pancake - very crisp and fresh. The dipping sauce could have used some more seasoning but still a good dish.\n\nAll the staff was super friendly, helpful, cheerful. Overall, a 5/5 experience and we will be dining again, maybe getting the table top KBBQ this time.", "Um.ma is what you would expect for a trendy SF spot serving Korean- smaller portions, higher price tag, cute plating. And shoot, they delivered on all three. And I can't speak of the authenticity of the food, but it seemed like a modern take on classics and most importantly, it was tasty.\n\nFor just two, we ordered quite a lot, but we wanted to try a lot of different things. We had the seafood pancake, veggie bibimbap, grilled pork belly, and chicken wings (we tried all 3 flavors). Plus the food comes with banchan (marinated quail eggs are my favorite and this is the first restaurant I've been to that serves this) and purple rice. Everything was delicious, but my favorite was the grilled pork belly. It was juicy and tender, but not overly fatty. It was served with some sliced plum which served as a great palate cleanser. At the end of dinner, we were stuffed and had enough leftovers for 3 meals. Even our server said she though we ordered way too much but she liked our style (and she was great too). No complaints!", "This spot is incredible!! My friend and I went on a Saturday for lunch (make sure you call ahead for a reservation). The outdoor patio is spacious and charming; the picnic tables were far apart and there were heat lamps. The proximity to GG park is a plus too.\n\nWe got the kimchi fried rice with bulgogi, the fried tofu sandwich, and the KBBQ Cheetos. Everything was incredible, and the portions were massive. We had more than half of the kimchi rice left over! The tofu in the sandwich was super crispy and had the perfect level of spice. I highly recommend it for vegetarians and meat lovers alike.\n\nThe service was quick and friendly. Great vibes overall. We will definitely be back!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/um-ma-san-francisco-3?hrid=uTAwo-VTCKWD2l6Lx10Nnw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/um-ma-san-francisco-3?hrid=byPIojXH0pUKaloRaVtblw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/um-ma-san-francisco-3?hrid=XR8G1ReASgPdeKnsE5KBng&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/um-ma-san-francisco-3?hrid=xt_VnJmOwFQT5u_VCB9j9g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/um-ma-san-francisco-3?hrid=MCPJDc0uOd2mxhnt6sWxQw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/um-ma-san-francisco-3?hrid=nSUB6RmBMbjJrWWLg78eVw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Thip Khao", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/thip-khao-washington/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/district-of-columbia/washington-dc/restaurant/thip-khao", "michelin_pov": "Having earned herself a loyal following at Bangkok Golden in Falls Church, Chef Seng Luangrath continues to wow crowds in ever-transforming Columbia Heights.Thip Khao\u2019s menu tempts with its sheer variety, from snacks and salads to soups, curries and a panoply of entr\u00e9es.

I must get the pig ear in it. It adds a layer of texture which just makes it out of this world.\n\nThe first time that I ever tried beef tongue was this restaurant. I am glad I got it here because it was amazing. I have always thought that beef tongue would be chewy and bland but it might be one of the most tender pieces of meat if cooked correctly.\n\nFinally, I have been waiting for some of the more exotic features including ant eggs.

I've never had Laotian before, so I can't speak to its authenticity, but I've never had such interesting and delightful arrays of herbs in savory dishes.\n\nAlthough it didn't detract from our experience, I do feel that the restaurant had a crowded and rushed feel--perhaps they're just too popular for their own good, haha (it was a Saturday night at the head of dinner rush)-- if you want a weekend night without waiting at least an hour, make a reservation for sure. And to its credit, despite the harried atmosphere, our service was admirable.", "There are very few places I am comfortable waiting over an hour for a table: Thip Khao is one such restaurant. Thip Khao has quickly abandoned its 'neighborhood gem' moniker, becoming a true destination in Cleveland Park. Reservations are beyond recommended, particularly on weekends.\n\nThe menus--regular dining and the fiery 'Jungle Menu'--offer both traditional Laotian dishes and inventive delicacies boasting ingredients like alligator, duck heads, or cow tongue. Be advised that the Jungle Menu is spicy, liberally tossed with chili peppers and spicy oils. Keep a libation close at hand.\n\nTo that note, the restaurant has an underrated cocktail menu, an impressive cider selection (including an ANXO collaboration cider) and a simple, but apt, wine list. The bartenders are deft and talented, even happily recreating house cocktails from previous menus.\n\nThip Khao also has an interest in the sustainability of the regions' wildlife, offering specials on invasive species.

The Hunan pork is a good dish, with tender crispy green beans and pork belly slices perfectly seasoned.

Served on the bone and in a thick spicy sauce, it's pulled apart slightly table-side in a large bowl (tender enough to be done so with two spoons). This pork shoulder was amazing.

To contrast with the chicken. Had the signature five spice flavor and was actually good mixed in with the lo mein.\nThe patron next to us ordered the house special braised pork shank over garlic noodles. It looked good as well.\n\nService was friendly and professional. The only criticism I have is the appetizers were served with main course.

I went on a Saturday night which was a big mistake since there were graduation parties taking place here. Some of the dishes we chose were hit-or-miss. I ordered 2 appetizers: cold pork w/spicy sauce and jellyfish. The spicy sauce was good but the pork was like sandwich meat and half of it looked like bacon fat. The jellyfish was even more disappointing because they were cut in huge thick strips. Maybe it is a different style of cooking b/c I usually eat the thin cut kind.\nThe appetizers sucked but the main dishes were excellent. We ordered two authentic Szechuan dishes. Not sure of the names but one of them was cumin lamb  which was my favorite. The cumin made the lamb less greasy. The other dish was beef that was stewed in a red chili oil hot pot. It is supposed to be one of spiciest Chinese foods but I think they toned down the spicy-ness for the white peeps The chili oil was still numbing despite not being spicy for me.\nChina Village is very clean and the hostess is nice.

I think they have fallbacks standards like chow mein and mushu but these are off-cuisine and probably could be had a bit cheaper.\n\nYou seem some comments on ambiance and friendliness.

No biggie...it was kinda generous before.\n\nBut the service. Oh boy. They seem to hire college students rather than professional bar staff. It took ten minutes of me sitting at the bar before they even thought to offer me a menu. There's \"fleabag lookalike\" who spent ten minutes polishing a glass while she was watching the movie they were playing. They play the same movie every night, so who knows what she was getting out of it. Then there's \"blonde gormless dude\". He spent most of the evening staring into space, or talking to his co-workers. And then there's \"hoop earrings\" who managed to forget our order as she walked the two yards from the bar to the POS.

The Dungeness crab really shown and I like the sauce paired. El Clasico is perfect for people who are a fan of mild cheese and beef. The manchego flavour was strong and this happens to be one of my favourite cheeses. Beef patty had great flavour and texture. Loved the buns for both burgers.\n\nBimi was just okay.

Everyone paid close attention to detail and you could easily see this restaurant is a family, working together as a unit.\n\nWe left feeling as though we pulled a chair up to a kitchen table and ate and drank with our closest friends. ...I mean who else would send us home with homemade chocolate chip zucchini bread?!\n\nHey, Michelin Guide! It's time to get back to Sac and revisit this restaurant!", "This restaurant is phenomenal! An absolute pleasure to dine in and learn about food. Eating the perfectly prepared and presented food almost felt like a divine experience (it was that amazing!). We scored by not making reservations way in advance and getting seated at the counter. Don't be fooled by thinking this is a \"less than\" situation. We whole heartedly enjoyed learning and seeing how the food was prepared as well as getting personal interaction with chef/owner during almost every course. There's a story behind every food that is carefully crafted like his, and we got to hear some of it! We felt like VIPs at Localis! The support staff and support chefs all looked like they were actually enjoying what they do too. The whole vibe was awesome, and everyone there seemed to genuinely care about the food and folks dining. The music was also great. The chef Christopher really pours his heart into the food, and you can taste the love and art that goes into it. Each meal was totally different yet somehow felt complimentary to the next meal. The meals hit every food flavor, acidity, heat, texture, etc you could imagine.\nI cannot wait to go back and tantalize my tastebuds again. I'd give 100 stars if I could. Thanks chef Christopher!", "Insanely excellent!  Went with the family for a birthday dinner. Two of us split the five course tasting menu, one had the surf and turf (Bay Halibut and chorizo) and one had the eggs and serrano bacon.\n\nEvery course was outstanding. The produce was so fresh we agreed one could order a bowl of their greens and be happy with just those. The top items for us were the wagyu beef (totally orgasmic), the quail eggs and duck yolk, sous vide rabbit with crust, and raw scallops.\n\nDesserts were brought out, i think we had three or four samplings. Everything first rate. Service was unparalled, chef came out several times to check on us. Food is top, top quality and the prices are reasonable, considering the food quality and output.

Got seated right away and the waitstaff was so great and attentive! The menu is all local and farm to fork! Everything, let me say that again, EVERYTHING, was impeccable! We started with the Octopus and we could eat this over and over. It was cooked perfectly and the papas bravas and romaneso pur\u00e9e with it was fantastic. We also had the asparagus and strawberry salad. This was simply delicious. The pink peppercorn vinaigrette was such a perfect pairing. I ordered the Emigh Lamb and without a doubt the best lamb I have ever had and the whole dish was out of this world delicious and not to mention beautiful to look at. It was served with farro and carrot pur\u00e9e. Damn is all I can say. Still drooling. My bf got the Llano Seco Pork and again perfection. Pork was seasoned perfectly and cooked to show the quality of the pork. Served with an outstanding polenta cake and asparagus! We ended he night with the strawberries done hella ways. We dug in so quick we forgot to take a picture of that one. But if it is one the menu when you go, get it!! Can't wait to go back and now an recommending this as top restaurant in Sac!", "Reservations can be made easily on OpenTable. There are three different seating options: chef's counter, high top, and standard which is in the covered patio.\n\nThe Chef's Tasting Menu in January 2019 is the \"Celebration of Citrus\"\n\nFood:\n+ fire roasted octopus - the highlight of our meal. Supposedly this dish is what put them on the map and it didn't disappoint! The octopus was tender and flavorful. Definitely order this as an accompaniment to the tasting menu.\n+ I opted for the 5 course meal, which included the following as highlights - winter citrus garden (citrus fennel deconstructed salad) and the chocolate orange. The pork and beans and the filet mignon had so much potential. The pork was a little salty and the crust was a bit soggy. The filet had a brownish color on the inside, wasn't as flavorful, and was not as soft. I'm pretty bummed about the filet as it's usually always the highlight of my meals when doing a tasting menu.\n\nService was prompt, wonderful, and friendly. The host who seats you is absolutely welcoming and warm. Kudos to her (wish I remembered her name)! Overall, for the price that I paid for the meal, I definitely expected more creativity and precision with the execution of some of the dishes.", "The chef prepares delightful food. Every time I eat the chefs tasting menu I set upon an amazing journey filled with great memories. The wine pairings compliment the food well. If you have any issue with the wine or the food the chef is more than happy to change something up to your liking.

We went on a Friday and ordered the fish of the day special.  $28, tiny piece of a white filet with skin on, with a tablespoon of pureed lentils, a vegetable that was literally half a fork full and tasted like shredded lemon rinds, fish was so bland and a little fishy smelling, was over baked as if it had been pre-cooked and then heated.  Decor is very worn out.  They offer odd dishes not to everyones liking.  Cheap ingredients like bone marrow.  The fried calamari was a small long octopus tentacle, (looked like a carrot?) Gross! You only get one tiny one.  No left overs no sharing there is not even enough for one.  What is more larger portions is the cheap stuff, PASTA. and POTATOES.  Will not go back.  Parking is on street you pay a meter.  We went home starving and had to eat our leftovers at home.  That was a waste $100.  Totally thrown away.  Let the waiter know of our experience and he said \"well when you come back next time, I'll order for you?\"", "Just moved to the neighborhood. This restaurant came highly reccomended and has received high ratings. I was disappointed. I had dinner there last Thursday 1/11/18 after a workout at the gym. $6 for bread and butter, so  nothing to snack on while waiting for our appetizers. We ordered 3 appetizers, the  octopus was great,  cold eggplant was disappointing  and mozzarella was average.    Forget about the Branzino en croute, which is in a thick flavorless pastry,ugh.  It's still sitting in my fridge. I should have sent it back and ordered something else.  Have the half chicken instead.  Can't go wrong with chicken.

Not only that, but their atmosphere is as welcoming as their service. Since it was my first time here the server gave me the fancy on everything. The dishes are creatively made, making the food taste even better. I felt as if I were dining in an elegant setting with the white line tablecloths and dimmed lighting. The restaurant is not big, but in turn, provides an intimate dining experience.\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to share our selections so that we could try different dishes. The Spicy Dan Dan Noodles had just the right spices and a delectable aroma. The Peruvian Potatoes' aji Amarillo gave it a tolerable spicy kick to it. The namesake Fancy Radishes had a combination of smoke and citrus that provided a tasty pairing. For dessert, we tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding that was more of an oatmeal raisin crisp and ice cream mixture that was out of this world. Everything we tried was amazing, as with the prices. We both are excited to return to try more of the menu's offerings.", "We had a fantastic dinner at the Fancy Radish and it is completely worth the hype! Every single dish was creative, made with care, and extremely flavorful. I'm not sure I can pick a favorite. We split five dishes and a dessert between two people. The rutabaga fondue with pretzel bread, the avocado, the fancy radish, Peruvian potatoes, and a new dish, the ramen carbonara. I absolutely loved the fondue - it was delightfully savory and tangy. All of the dishes were popping with flavor and consistently excellent. The ramen carbonara in particular was surprisingly good. I was a little hesitant at first because of the unusual combo, but it was amazingly creamy and rich. My dining partner couldn't believe there was no cheese or butter used in the dish. The sauce is incredibly rich and creamy, and the ramen noodles are cooked perfectly with the perfect spring. They soaked up the sauce nicely. I enjoyed experiencing a carbonara as a pescatarian! For dessert, we got the sour cherries, which comes in an enormous bowl with two fried donuts and ice cream. It didn't disappoint either. The meal was a little pricey but completely worth it, and I hope to come back soon to try some of the other dishes we didn't get to try this time.", "If you are skeptical about veggies tasting as good as and being as filling as meat, this place will change your mind!\n\nTo start, we had the Smoked chioggia beet toast. It literally tasted like smoked salmon and cream cheese on toast. It was amazing!\n\nThen, we had the Seared maitake mushroom which was so yummy and the celery fritter that came with it was incredibleeee.\n\nWe then had the Trumpet mushrooms which is served almost like a noodle with broth. Really yummy!\n\nNext, the Singapore noodles and the Spicy dan Dan noodles. Both were awesome (and very spicy, even for me who is a spice lover and Asian!) but I would have to say the Dan dan noodles were our favorite. Love the sesame on top!\n\nTo finish it off, we had the Sticky toffee pudding, the Pumpkin spice ice cream (which was seasonal for fall), And the Mud pie which is basically deconstructed bananas foster with brownies. All of it was so good! I will def be back.", "This is probably the best food I've had...ever. Came here for a date night and was really excited because it had taken a while to get a reservation. Fancy Radish did not disappoint. We got the stuffed avocado to start and it was amazing. There was a spicy sauce on it which I usually don't like but it was really well done. Next we got the trumpet mushrooms. It was thin mushrooms as \"pasta\" in an oil sauce with tomatoes. It sounds weird but it was unbelievably good. We only planned on getting two dishes to try and dessert, but we liked the first two dishes so much we decided to get a third one. The Peruvian potatoes by far were my favorite. The potatoes were well done and came slathered in a sauce that was just amazing. Finished off with s'mores. I love dessert and this lived up to my excited. The best part was the burbon pecan topping with the marshmallow fluff. Thank you for a great meal, we plan to come back for the fondue!", "I'd heard about how popular this place was, but I took my chances without a reservation by showing up with a friend on a Tuesday night at around 8:30pm..  There was plenty of space at the bar, and we were welcome to sit there and order drinks and dinner.  The bartender was friendly and helpful when it came to picking from the menu. My coffee and rum-based cocktail was served in a fun pineapple glass. (Note: It was a lot easier to drink with a straw, which was available by request).   Our most interesting small plate was the smoked carrots. This is a plate of 5 carrots coated with pastrami spice, some miniature pumpernickel toast and sauerkraut.  It was an interesting play on pastrami - the spices were certainly the same ones you'd taste with a real pastrami sandwich.  Every dish had that same idea - several components artfully combined to make this small plate of food interesting and unique.   I'd be interested in returning and sampling more of the menu.  (We had 4 dishes between us and would have ordered more if this had been an earlier dinner).", "I don't have enough superlatives for this review. If you are wondering if you should go to this restaurant, just stop reading and make a reservation. Everything we ate was spectacular, the service was warm and truly friendly, and the space is comfortable and attractive.\n\nWe ordered the grilled beets, trumpet mushroom fazzoletti, ramen carbonara, and tofu chermoula.

The Hunan pork is a good dish, with tender crispy green beans and pork belly slices perfectly seasoned. The Chili prawns were also good, with a PILE of dried chili peppers making it for a spicy, flavorful bite. The Pork Shoulder was impressive and delicious. Served on the bone and in a thick spicy sauce, it's pulled apart slightly table-side in a large bowl (tender enough to be done so with two spoons). This pork shoulder was amazing. I wanted to order another so i could take it home, honestly.

To contrast with the chicken. Had the signature five spice flavor and was actually good mixed in with the lo mein.\nThe patron next to us ordered the house special braised pork shank over garlic noodles. It looked good as well.\n\nService was friendly and professional. The only criticism I have is the appetizers were served with main course. We were warned about this up front and maybe that's just sitting at the bar, not sure.\n\nEither way, food was excellent, plentiful and service was polite and prompt.", "I have mixed feelings about this place. I went on a Saturday night which was a big mistake since there were graduation parties taking place here. Some of the dishes we chose were hit-or-miss. I ordered 2 appetizers: cold pork w/spicy sauce and jellyfish. The spicy sauce was good but the pork was like sandwich meat and half of it looked like bacon fat. The jellyfish was even more disappointing because they were cut in huge thick strips. Maybe it is a different style of cooking b/c I usually eat the thin cut kind.\nThe appetizers sucked but the main dishes were excellent. We ordered two authentic Szechuan dishes. Not sure of the names but one of them was cumin lamb  which was my favorite. The cumin made the lamb less greasy. The other dish was beef that was stewed in a red chili oil hot pot. It is supposed to be one of spiciest Chinese foods but I think they toned down the spicy-ness for the white peeps The chili oil was still numbing despite not being spicy for me.\nChina Village is very clean and the hostess is nice.

Good portion size but not huge.\n\nThe front end is efficient but miss the past friendliness. They try to move the tables so just short of pushing you out the door. Didn't even offer us the dessert menu.\n\nWill think twice before coming back. Even with liking the food and the owner.\n\nFood is 4 stars but service was 2 or less.", "We live nearby, and it is a pleasure to get a great, specialized, fresh Chinese meal right on Solano. Tonight is our second trip in two days. The pork shoulder is amazing, the West Lake spicy fish is fiery, the bitter melon is bitter. As close as we can, we concentrate on the Sichuan specialties (salty spices, Szechuan style peppercorns, pickles, spicy dishes).\n\nI've gone with different friends on different occasions with mixed results on the authentic dishes (which is a lot of the menu). I think they have fallbacks standards like chow mein and mushu but these are off-cuisine and probably could be had a bit cheaper.\n\nYou seem some comments on ambiance and friendliness. My experience has been just fine. If you are scouting an intimate candlelit location to propose... I agree this probably isn't it. On the other hand, it is pleasant and I thought it was clean enough for the sort of place that it is.\n\nTry it!", "Really lovely setting to have a family-style dinner. Saturday night wait was about half an hour, and the restaurant was packed with families.\nThe food came out quickly and had a lovely presentation. The 1000 pepper fish soup has a rich broth, and the five spice pork shoulder falls right off the bone. Get some rice to go with it, and the green beans are a favorite, too.\nService was courteous and efficient, allowing everyone to eat in peace without interruption.

The classic osetra had the strongest \"fishy\" flavour and I was pleased that he found the golden osetra to be his favourite as well.  The yukon gold potato discs were a little too bold in my opinion but I very much enjoyed the blinis and the toast points with a delicate dollop of creme fraiche.  It ended up being quite a bit of caviar so we only ordered two other dishes to share.  \n\nThe uni was fantastic - the dashi complemented the richness and peculiarly unique loveliness of the sea urchin.

The place is SMALL, I think I counted 8 tables..very elegant and serene, with a second-floor view overlooking Madison Ave. Obviously, they have caviar, and it is very very expensive. However, the bet of their french-influenced menu is very reasonable. We had a caviar sampler, which I regret getting, as I should have just ordered 50 grams of one caviar. I ordered the sweetbreads for an appetizer, and I foie gras-stuffed quail breat wrapped in puff pastry, which were two of the best thing I have ever eaten...the quail was extremely rich, the sweetbreads pan-seared with a red wine sauce and chanterelles...unbelievable...and my first time trying sweetbreads.

This is my favorite restaurant in the city. I've probably been there 5 or 6 times at least even though it's 40 min trek from our apartment. When family visit we bring them here. Tonight we came and they were having their two year celebration and had a ridiculous amount of free gourmet delicious food including appetizers main course and dessert. It was like we won the lottery. We also ordered our favorites from the menu. The chickpea noodles, ginger spinach, and beef medallions. The people here are so nice and accommodating. The first couple times I visited, I was on a super strict medical diet, and they were one of the only restaurants that was able to make food without garlic or onion for example. The food here is so unique. You will not find such a rich variety of upscale Chinese cuisine from different regions at such a high quality anywhere else in the city. The menu is both approachable and adventurous. The staff are friendly. The ambiance is uniquely beautiful as well. But most importantly the food is unforgettably awesomely I can't say enough about this place.", "I'm going to keep it short and simple. Great food but extremely frustrating operation. I've tried to eat here 3x and all 3x there was an issue. First time they said they were closing early (9 pm) and that we were the last customers and had to hurry up and order. Ok fine. 2nd time there was a reservation and tasting event and they were quoting everyone a hour plus wait even though they had open tables. They turned away at least 30 customers- I finally got in when the manager saw me waiting, simply moved an open table. Asked me to tell my friends - that they need business- how can I tell my friends when you NEVER can seat anyone without issue. Last time I went they had open tables but had a private party and quoted me again an hour wait.\n\nHao noodle and tea, forget it!!\n\nGet your act right and then open for business.", "The physical atmosphere is lovely- sort of urban farmhouse if you will. However, the ambiance was ruined by the chef in the kitchen yelling \"SERVICE!\" every few moments into the dining area.  We had Dan Dan noodles, and a Cauliflower dish that were both complex and deliciously spectacular.  Dishes run on the HOT side so be forewarned. We also tried the chicken noodle soup but it was just okay.  It had none of the complexities or development of flavor that the other two dishes had.

Everything was absolutely on-point.\n\nCame back again to try the dining room with friends so we could try more of the menu, and again, ambiance, service, and food were perfect. The Scallop Crudo (one of my favorites) was creamy and delicate - seriously could've ordered 5 more to myself. The Kanpachi was also executed beautifully, though, a little difficult to eat since there are bones. My favorite of the night, by far, was the Roast Duck. The crust of spices and flavor packed such an amazing bite. Seriously, so so so worth. Honestly, both the dishes under the shared section of the mneu, were group pleasers. The Ribeye with lardo was definitely a new experience, but also incredibly flavorful.\n\nIf this review hasn't sent you to Reverie's reservation page, I haven't done a good enough job raving about our experience.

Service is always fantastic with everyone from the server, food runner, chef and even hostess ensuring you have a full glass or fresh utensils at all times.

I had the 16-course chef's counter menu, which was all-around excellent and inventive.\n\nI especially enjoyed the seafood courses: the tuna, razor clam, scallop, and skate dishes were delicate yet complex in flavor and beautiful in presentation.\n\nAny restaurant with 4 courses of dessert will win my heart. Loved the pistachio meringue tart and the petit fours! The beverage menu was fantastic as well. I hardly drink alcohol so I always order a mocktail when I'm dining out. \"Into the Woods\" was by far the best mocktail that I've ever had; it consists of a coffee base, non-alcoholic bourbon, and black walnut bitters. I also tried a delicious non-alcoholic wine that was not glorified fruit juice.\n\nService was great and unpretentious!

You can really observe the talent, detail and thought that goes into every dish. And ever single thing we observed and ordered over delivered!! This food is good - damn good. We ordered the Txuleta, which was inarguably the best steak I have ever had in my life. That said, the mushrooms and scallops were just as decadent.\n\nI think it's also worth noting that the staff was super approachable and unpretentious.

The whole head of cauliflower with tahini and almonds was perfectly roasted and so flavorful. The brussel sprouts are served with a hearty portion of brown sugar bacon. The potato dish was cheesy and delicious.\n\nOur table also split a sourdough with cheese appetizer, the tomato cream pie pizza, and the mint pesto lamb pasta.

It's nice to see the chefs preparing your dishes in the open kitchen. Prices are okay for Napa, service was personal and attentive. We liked most of the food ordered (we chose 3 of the roasted vegetables from the menu) - tasty, especially the Brussels sprouts with bacon. The cauliflower did not really convince us. Definitely go for the home made ice cream in the end. Unfortunate, we had a group of extremely annoying people sitting next to us and shouting so loud that we had to stop speaking at some point since we could hear our own word.

Bones slid right out and clean. The plate itself didn't have the most on it but eating it together with the romano beans and eggplant was perfect.\n\nDesserts are only ice cream.

This is to be followed by the main course: a large plate of basmati rice topped with safron soaked rice and long skewer of any type of kabob you can wish for.

I have Been to dozens of Iranian restaurants and this is by far the best. And when I ask Iranians I meet to recommend a place, this is the one they always agree on is the best. One of the fabulous things about this place, is they have an oven where they bake bread on the premises. No other restaurant can have this, but it has been grandfathered in by the fire department.

It used to be a pretty good restaurant, among the top 2-3 in Westwood. The first thing I noticed was a new decor, which is not only nothing to write home about but also has seemingly caused all prices to increase, some as much as 40% compared to today's prices of the best restaurant in Westwood, Shamshiri (e.g., lunch special Ghormeh Sanzi is $13.99 at Shahrzad vs. $9.99 at Shamshiri -- both include salad and bread. Shamshiri serves complimentary herbs too!). This price increase (probably combined with the quality of the food), has made Shahrzad a quiet place (due to fewer people and reasonably low volume if the music). The quiet ambience is not bad  at all and might be worth 10% more on the prices, if it weren't for the inferior quality of the food. I tried one dish but the quality of that, Ghormeh Sabzi, was well below average. I won't come back to try any of their other dishes at the prices the charge. Shamshiri is only a 200 yard walk away.\n\nOn the positive side, the service was good. The manager (new owner?) seems to be a pleasant and friendly person.", "My friend Danny, who is Persian, says this is the best place for Persian food in the neighborhood. That's a hefty endorsement right there!\n\nFrom my own experience, I can honestly back up his five-star rave... Let's begin with the bread... it was the perfect balance of crispy/soft and went well with the assorted appetizer platter we ordered... Served on a combination plate there was an order of stuffed grape leaves, some eggplant spread, chicken (ground, battered and fried -- yum!!) and something else tasty that I can't remember at the moment.\n\nFor dinner, as three people we were satisfied by two entrees -- the ground chicken kabob and the lamb kabob. We chose to get one with salad and the other with rice. This proved to be the perfect amount of food!\n\nOverall, if you are going to try one thing at Shaherzad, I recommend the lamb.

Some standouts for me were their sea bream nigiri and some of their seared ones. Some old dependable ones are always good, the toro/fatty tuna and some uncommon ones like barracuda!

My fianc\u00e9 and I went here last night for our anniversary and were not disappointed! The restaurant was socially distanced and all of the waiters very courteous. The starter was the goat cheese croquettes with honey and lavender.  Perfectly fried and gooey cheese on the inside. So tasty!\nWe ordered a bottle of wine and were pleasantly surprised that they had a staff member who spoke in detail about the different flavor profiles of the different options they had.\nI ordered the chicken and wouldn't share a single bite with my fianc\u00e9! The skin was so crispy and flavorful; the inside was so juicy. Everything was perfectly cooked. My fianc\u00e9 got the lobster tail and was blown away. He's been looking for a good lobster tail (everywhere else is so mediocre). This was outstanding!\nLast but not least was dessert. The Tahitian vanilla ice cream was amazing with the pastry and the dark chocolate sauce.\nWonderful restaurant! Kudos to the chef!", "I probably would have given this place five stars, I can't even begin to express how impressed I was with this place the atmosphere was so far beyond in San Luis Obispo, the service was good and the food was mostly exquisite. Most of us had steaks starters and salads all of which were really above average and excellent some of the best meat I've ever had. The only complaint I could find was the asparagus tastes like somebody spilled an entire Shaker of salt on it and was completely inedible oh, we brought it up to our server and was surprised it wasn't removed from the bill despite not eating it. And finally I was surprised that we got charged $25 a piece corkage on two bottles of wine we brought from home after purchasing a $400 bottle of champagne from the restaurants , maybe that's the policy who knows... the tuna tartare was outstanding, as was the wedge salad which was slightly off traditional as it wasn't smothered blue cheese but actually was a nice interpretation in a much lighter Style. All in all I can see myself going back to this place more frequently as its head and shoulders above anything else in SLO.", "Dined here for the first time last Friday. The restaurant opened just before COVID hit. Glad they made it through! Very nice atmosphere, clean and safe. Staff was welcoming and friendly. Chris was our waiter. He was knowledgeable on the menu and provided excellent service. He's also a true local history buff which adds to the charm. All the wait staff contributed to bring out the food when it was ready, which was very timely. Our glasses of sparkling water were refilled consistently throughout the night, never had to ask. We started with cocktails, then on to the Yellowfin Ahi Tuna Tartare which was awesome! For entrees we had chicken and New York steak. Sides are extra and served family style. We enjoyed the Brussels spouts and the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, and a bottle of red wine. Had the cheese and apple tart a la mode dessert, which is very dense!  This place is new, the menu is sophisticated and tasty. We felt appreciated as customers, the staff was attentive and worked as a team for our benefit. This restaurant is now at the top of our list of favorite fine dining spots!", "After an evening walk through downtown, I stumbled upon this beautiful new hotel property and the Ox and Anchor restaurant. Immediately was greeted by a sweet hostess, who took us right to a great table looking out from the restaurant. Our sever, Dylan, was especially attentive and provided great recommendations. The egg role appetizer he insisted we try was delicious and I then had the filet for my main course. The steak was tender and cooked a perfect medium rare. It was a beautiful night, extremely relaxing, and definitely worth another visit for both the food and the attentive service.", "My son and I took my daughter to Ox & Anchor for her 21st birthday -- it was our first time there. The service was amazing and the food exquisite! I had the filet mignon which was tender and *perfect!*  I also enjoyed the sampler plate of sauces on the side.  My daughter loved the Rosemary Roasted Chicken -- she swooned with every bite!  We had \"onion rings\" on the side that were at a whole new level.  They provided a complimentary dessert for her birthday: a Dark Chocolate Dome which the 3 of us devoured.   It was definitely a 5 star meal -- at a 5 star price, but that was fine!  If you're looking for amazing food -- particularly steak -- you must go to the Ox & Anchor!", "I just really love this place! From the service, to the ambiance, to the food. Everything is 5 stars. I have been here now at I believe 5 times, and it's so consistent with quality and service.\n\nThey do ask that you order your first course, mains, and sides all at the same time so the chef can space them out perfectly. And they really do!\n\nThe highlight for me is always the yellowfin ahi tuna tartare, it's literally perfect.\nThe filet mignon is always cooked medium rare as requested. The potato pur\u00e9e and mushrooms as the steaks sides are again out of this world.\nIt's so nice that slo has a fine dining steak restaurant like this!", "My son in law and I took my Granddaughter to dinner in early December for her graduation dinner from Cal Poly   It was such a great time for each of us.  We had a variety of entrees from seafood to duck to a steak that my son in law said was the tenderest he had ever eaten.  Our server was always available and very helpful.   This was the second time we have eaten at the Hotel SLO and both times were awesome.  When we return to San Luis we will head to one of the restaurants at the hotel.

First, it's a family owned business which I always like to support. Second, the service on the two occasions that I've been there has been consistently welcoming and friendly. Had a great connection with our waiter. Lastly, and in some cases most important...the food is remarkable! I've had the pleasure of visiting Trinidad and Tobago so am familiar with some of their signature dishes. Cane has nailed bringing Trini flavors to DC. A must have are the Trini-Asian 5 spice drums. They will blow you away. Juicy and full of great flavor. We convinced the folks next to us to order them and they ended up ordering a 2nd order after they tried them. They are that good. For our entree we ordered the omnivore paratha tiffin box (plenty for 2). It's such a great way to experience multiple signature dishes. Tip...if you like spicy ask your waiter for the red spicy sauce. It doesn't come with the meal so you have to ask. Be prepared though it is spicy. My only disappointment was that they ran out of the Goat:( I know it would have been amazing. There's always next time, and trust me there will be a next time. Keep up the great work Cane!!!", "My family is from the Caribbean and so I was super excited to try this new Trinidadian restaurant that features street food. I haven't had doubles in ages and was really looking forward to it. A friend accompanied me who loves oxtail so we were thrilled to make dinner plans here.\n\nOur server, Jade, was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The doubles did not disappoint and are highly recommended. My friend noted that although the oxtail was tender and delicious it seemed to be missing some extra seasoning somehow. The eggplant that I ordered was also tasty but could have used some saut\u00e9ed tomatoes in addition to the garlic and onions. I ordered pholourie but the kitchen did not have it that night. Very sad for me as it's one of my all time favorite street foods.\n\nWe ordered cocktails that were just ok, nothing special unfortunately. I would be willing to give it another try, including another cocktail.", "This restaurant is awesome. There aren't many Trini restaurants in general. This was delicious is every sense of the word. You want spicy? It's here. You want sweet? It's here. I literally did not eat ONE BAD THING while here. Peter and Jeanine Prime are doing DC a great service by offering flavors you literally won't get unless you go to Trinidad!", "Indeed, one of the most enticing takes on escovitch snapper. The fish was beautiful, yes, but the taste was better than the presentation. The skin was so crispy, and the meat inside was succulent and seasoned to perfection. The pickled sliced scotch bonnets brought a fruity heat to the palate -- I ate it all (garnish too)! The rice was the perfect accompaniment -- fragrant with hints of pimento and chives. The sampling of the homemade green seasoning was the foundation for the fried fish, but I recommend the chow and \"cane juice\" for the perfect bite.\n\nThe chef mastered jerk wings. How? The meat fell from the bone with the ideal amount of spice and smokey essence of pimento wood. The star of the plate, however, was the housemade garlic sauce. Only the kind you can get in Trinidad, and Cane of course. Wings may not sound like a game-changer, but they are superior in every way.\n\nThe service kept pace with the kitchen, and the waitlist was executed efficiently.", "This is at least 4.5 stars for both service n food. Ordered oxtail , snapper and jerk wing. I was impressed the most with the oxtail. Moist n tender and tasty. With a bowl of coconut milk rice, it is perfect. Jerk wing can be spicier. But it is juicy n tender.  Snapper is grilled till crispy and top with pickled chilli n cucumber.  Unfortunately it is a little dry. I will rate 5 stars if the fish is more juicy. The fish was served with some leave and greenish sauce on the plate. The greenish sauce is very unique n tasty. It is a bit minty with cilantro I think. Not exactly sure how was that made. I hope that oil or butter or sauce can be applied while grilling to make the fish more juicy. N pair that with the special green sauce and pickled. The taste will be more complex and tasty in my opinion.", "Loved Cane, even to go! Can only imagine how good it is to eat in.\n\nCalled in our order and showed up. Didn't have to wait too long on a Friday night, and they were busy! They do a great job with the takeout.\n\nWe ordered the jerk wings (knew these would be delicious based on the ones from Spark), geera pork belly (amazing), Indian fried bread (amazing), crispy kale (amazing), the oxtail and the pepperpot (oxtail brisket and tendon stew). Everything had great flavor and serving sizes were good - we were stuffed after this meal. The oxtail and stew were delicious, but super rich - be careful ordering this amount of food or the two dishes together, as they're both fatty and filling.\n\nWill definitely be back to try more.", "THEY NEED A LARGER SPACE!\n\nPatrons should not be forced to sit nearly on top of each other.\n\nI've been twice in the last 2 months, arriving before 6pm both times.

The ribs were truly fall-off-the-bone tender with a nice flavor. The prohibition sauce was smokey with a definite bite of heat, but nothing particularly strong. I like a bit of heat, but I don't want it to hide the flavor. This sauce definitely filled the bill. I accompanied the ribs with a draft from one of the local breweries.

Orders around the table were half rack, half rack and chicken combo, and a full rack.  All come with a side, coleslaw and a pickle.  They all came with the zesty sauce on them, and then the mild and the spicy on the side.  Ribs were fall off the bone, and the spicy sauce was so good we had to ask for another.  Fries were fine, onion rings were large and crunchy and the baked beans were great.  There were some regrets of not going with the full rack for some of the combo people, cause come on, the ribs are the star of the show.  Great portions as well, and a good selection of beers on draft.  This place is definitely a winner.", "Twin Anchor is one of the oldest original restaurant in the city of Chicago. Since its founding in 1932, Twin Anchors has always been known for great, tender, barbequed baby-back ribs that can be enjoyed in a quaint neighborhood tavern. Twin Anchors is a 100 % Chicago legend! Some of the best BBQ in the country. Their Prohibition sauce might be my favorite BBQ sauce. There's a short list of places that are a must eat in the city these days and Twin Anchors is at the top of that list.

We went early before the place got packed, so were seated right away outside on the patio.

Nothing's seems to have changed to the place.\n\nI recall the ribs, to my taste, as not being great. And in this area, Twin Anchors remained the same.\n\nIt was lunchtime on a Saturday. They were nearly full. We got lucky and we're seated right away. Our waiter was cheery and helpful.\n\nI order a half-rack rib meal. For my side, I chose their homemade zesty baked beans with pork.  The meal also came with a tiny order of creamy coleslaw and a pickle spear.\n\nMy wife ordered a side salad and a cup of their acclaimed homemade chili. We shared both meals.\n\nThe ribs, as mentioned above, we \"just okay\". They were tender and meaty, just not my style. But I ate them nonetheless :)\n\nThe real star in my opinion was the beans.

The reservation was made over a month ago, poor hosting decision and seating selection for 6 people.\n\nAn extensive wine list, we enjoyed a lovely Tempranillo, and was visited by Joe the owner. The food was good, I especially liked the lamb meatballs, and whipped ricotta with ciabatta bread.\n\nThe dessert picture here, \"chocolate royal\" was decadent!\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure my overall experience, and poor seating gives me a reason to want to go back. They didn't even make the effort to put a candle on the dessert, but they did at another table near us celebrating a Birthday. There are so many places in the Fulton Market area that I enjoy much more.", "Came to Joe's for brunch with my girlfriends and had a great time. Since there was nice weather we opted to sit on the patio and the waiters were all extremely attentive and helpful. When the weather got rainy later, they immediately found us a table inside and kept the service going!\n\nFood wise, I love this as a place to share a few dishes. We started by ordering the whipped ricotta (personal favorite), followed by spring pea salad, crab cakes, avocado toast, and ending with tea and the sweet pancakes.\n\nTo pair with our meal, we got glasses of rose and spritzers. I highly recommend the passion fruit spritz - it's not on the menu but definitely something worth asking about!\n\nIf I were to come back...

The bar is beautiful. Solid remodel. Service was excellent.\n\nWe ordered joes Parmesan puffs. They were delicious but the addition of fondue dipping sauce was a little to heavy and savory for me. This is coming from a cheese lover.\n\nThe sea urchin scramble was also good but missing a little salt. Might've been our fault since we ordered it without the colatura. This is what we get for messing with the chefs creation.\n\nThe hash brown was fine. Nothing can usurp McDonalds title though.\n\nThe snow crab Benedict was delicious. I'd ordered this again. I was surprised it was not served on bread and on the crab cake itself. Less carbs, yay.\n\nWould go again for dinner. Great date spot.", "I've visited Joe's twice and loved it both times!

Highly recommend making a reservation and not sleeping on visit Joe's.", "This is definitely one of my new favorite brunch spots.  Reservations were easy to make for our party of 5.  We were just disappointed that the weather would not allow for us to be seated outside, but it was early enough that we could dine comfortably without the restaurant being too crowded.\n\nThe menu has great choices for brunch, sweet or savory. We opted for a lot of starters to share and then a main.\n\nParmesaen puffs, Tomato bread, ricotta and honey and the burrata. I loved them all, but would have to say the ricotta was the table favorite. the ricotta was light and fluffy and the honey was a great accompanyment. I was most disappointed in the tomato bread as it was too acidic and unfortunately had to be compared to the tomato bread I've had in Spain and well, you get it-it's Spain!\n\nI chose the pork confit hash for my main and it was delicious. I was hoping for more heat, but the cute little tobasco bottles they provide was perfect.  The Spritz Slush was the perfect brunch drink--frosty and refreshing.\n\nService was friendly and didnt mind our questions. Everyone followed COVID dining guidelines.  It was a really great experience.  Cant wait to just go back for cocktails and apps at the bar!", "A gem of a place! Cozy and welcoming ambiance. The menu is comprised of small plates, each with an accompanying wine recommendation. The service was perfect- neither neglectful nor overbearing. The dishes were timed perfectly. We got 4 plates  between the two of us, which was enough.  The parmesan cheese puffs were delicious. My wagayu was cooked to perfection. The ravioli with duck egg was heavenly. We topped it off with a shared dessert. My partner was orgasmic over the 2 reds he had with dinner. They were out of his dessert wine choice, so they brought him a cognac on the house.  Then Joe came by (yes, that Joe) who was gregarious and full of information about his curated wine list. He generously poured us each a glass of his favorite dessert wine.

And it was fantastic!\n\nThis place has my vote on all accounts: great beer list, amazing and creative atmostphere (check out the industrial fans left over from the space's previous life as an autoshop), knowledgable and friendly staff, open kitchen with beautiful wood burning pizza oven, incredible, thin crust pies and PROVEL cheese. As a St. Louis native, enjoying a pie covered in the tart, creamy cheese brings back delicious, long forgotten food memories. I love a New York slice as much as the next transplant, but there's something so special about quality, hometown mid-western flavors, especially when they're refined enough to coalesce with the hip, Brooklyn foodie scene. I also love that this is no Barboncino replica -- they expand their purview to steaks, chops and other non-pizza dishes that really deliver (see steak tartare reference, above). I recommend trying the stuffed peppers appetizer if you like a little spice.

But no one does it right for a neighborhood restaurant ... I begged them to open one up in Park Slope. The price, the menu, the staff and the ambiance are all great components to a successful restaurant..\nJust reading the menu got me excited... It's not just the great pizzas with amazing pickled peppers, the salads are all good ( eggplant and fresh mozzarella , Caesar and beet salad). Yes, I tried all three pizzas as well  (saint Louie, the kind brother, and the big poppa). They were all DeLicious with the pickled peppers. I generally don't eat  steak but when it arrived to the table, it looked so delicious that I had to try it. It was probably one of the best steak I ever had ( it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside). The lemon tart was not traditional but delicious and the chocolate cake with the branded marshmallow was over the top. From appetizer to dessert, everything was yummy and the wine and Procecco were also delicious. There's plenty on the menu so I will be back to try everything on the menu....", "Speedy Romeo was a surprisingly wonderful experience. As a New Yorker, I eat my pizza by usually ordering it at a street window and then folding it in two as I eat on the sidewalk. On the other hand, I love flavorful and creative cuisine, and I love going to weird new restaurants. Speedy Romeo is great because it's attractive to both my New Yorker side and my foodie side.\n\nI recommend making a reservation before you go because it gets crowded for dinner. The seating is a little cramped so it can be intimate if you're on a date, but I noticed that they make room for big groups.\n\nThe food was amazing. I was really surprised at how flavorful everything was, and not in a way I was expecting. The grilled octopus was recommended to me, and it was amazing. It's topped with almond, and I can't even tell you how good it was. The house mozzarella was also a pleasant surprise because it came with figs, which was just such a great combination. We ordered the Margherita pizza and the White Album and it was just so good. SO good! Everything has a unique taste, and it really was an amazing experience. Every time I talk to my friends about restaurants, I insist they try this place.", "Awesome!\n\nHaving only been open for a week they're doing so much right. The ambience is really chill, the decor unpretentious but stylish and all the staff are friendly, knowledgeable & relaxed. We had about a 15min wait for a table which I take a great sign given how new they are - the neighborhood is clearly loving this new addition.\n\nAll the food is really simple and respectful of the clearly high quality organic ingredients they're using....massive thumbs up from me!\n\nWe ordered the mozzerella salad which I'd tried before when the owners had a pop-up at Brooklyn Flea last summer. If you tried it there, go back and see what they've done with it now....it comes with smoked eggplant on toast... . :-)\n\nWe also ordered the beet salad which is great... But, the clear winner was the St Louis pizza....if you go here and don't order it you're crazy! And then, when you know you're too full to roll onto the G train, wait 5 mins and order the chocolate cake which comes with soft marshmallow (which they brand at the table) and graham crackers.\n\nI'll be back, probably next week.\n\nGreat job guys, keep it going!", "Straight down the middle establishment. The first time, our pizzas came out under-cooked--and I am a chewy cookie type. The second time, they were quite nicely crisped. I'd uncharacteristically recommend the \"White Album,\" which goes above and beyond any other white pizzas (save maybe a slice of Artichoke Basile at 3:00am) with its creamy bechamel, garlic and suite of white cheeses. The \"Dangerfield\" is satisfactory, if unimaginative, and the \"Speedy Romeo\" is far too tart.\n\nSpeedy Romeo is a Motorino wannabe that needs to work out a couple simple kinks to be good. First, this place is waaaay too kid-friendly for its terrible acoustics and upmarket wine bar vibe. Before I am poked with pitchforks: I have seen and heard cringe-inducing kid spills, fights, and rampant runs through this place with nary a comment from management.  Start a daycare annex, or knock that gratuitous extra $4 off the cost of my pizza. Your choice.\n\nSecond, there's just something a little unwelcoming about the staff here--a fact not remedied by their phone being off the hook whenever we want to order delivery.

Killed it, I challenge anyone to say they've had a more delicious steak fry, the vinegar, spice and herbs only made them even better. Yes they make their own gelato.

The fish sourcing here is stellar, and Chef Derek, who trained for 15+ years in Japan (both Kyoto and Tokyo), knows how to use them in harmony with other ingredients.\n\nI went for the 4th time last night, and Chef Derek was demonstrating even more of his skill showcasing amaebi in a hot sashimi style and then using the broth it poached in for a stellar chawanmushi later in the meal. Both were some of my favorites of the prepared dishes and then so many favorites pieces: Ika, Aji, Jabara Toro. I mean I could just list them all and it would still be accurate.\n\nThe sake and wine list is also interesting, diverse and well-priced which makes for an all-around wonderful meal.\n\nCheck out more on my IG: @cy_eats.", "I have been to Shoji many times, and each time it has been exceptional. The menu is based on the season, as Chef Derek Wilcox only uses the highest quality seasonal ingredients. As far as the fish goes, he seeks on wild seasonal fish. Many of the fish and vegetables he uses you won't see at other Japanese restaurants, due to limited availability and high costs. At Shoji they seek out the best, regardless of cost.\n  The Chef has been formally trained in Japan in both Kaiseki and Sushi. He has trained/worked  in very highly regarded restaurants in Japan.\nDining in this small and special restaurant, makes one feel like they are dining in Japan. The Kappo/Kaiseki dishes are exquisite and his sushi is excellent, with special care given to the rice, making sure you get perfect shari.  I highly recommend this restaurant, for a fantastic meal, excellent service, and a unique memorable experience.", "The ingredient sourcing here is certainly among the highest in New York, probably North America outside of Japan.  All wild fish at peak season - which means sometimes the variety will vary, but you'll never be let down.  At a price point that is 20% cheaper than other top sushiya in New York, the relative value is also obvious.\n\nChef Derek Wilcox is one of the only American chefs who can boast completing a full apprenticeship in Japan and it shows in his attention to detail in everything from the rice seasoning to making many of the sauces and marinades from scratch.\n\nIt's not a pure sushi experience, as the course contains more of a kaiseki/kappo flair, but it's no doubt one of the best sushiya in New York and probably the US.  I have been five times since September and will be back again.", "This is one of the best sushi experiences I have had.  Chef Derek Wilcox puts so much thought and care into each piece.  There were so many interesting seasonal vegetables used and unique tastings.\nWe requested sake by the glass to be paired with each tasting and they did a wonderful job with the pairings as well.\nBefore going here I had read other yelp reviews that were mentioning chef Eiji Ichimura who was the former chef at Brushstroke.  I did a google search and found that he used to have a restaurant in this location with a different name and the restaurant closed sometime in 2017 I think.\nShoji 69 is a new restaurant at the same location that opened around September of 2017 with a new chef (Derek Wilcox) who has worked in Japan for the last 10 years, seven of which were at Kyoto's three-Michelin-starred kaiseki restaurant Kikunoi.  He speaks fluent Japanese and I might say that he is able to provide such an interesting and unique sushi experience because he has both American culinary training and 10 years in Japan working and training and being fully immersed in the culture.", "This is seriously one of the best, if not the best, sushi spots in New York. The quality is unbelievable for the price point and compared to other similar japanese restaurants in Manhattan. It looks like the negative reviews are from bitter people who don't understand the cuisine or fine dining.", "If you are interested in eating only the best ingredients, then this is the place for you.\n\nThe chef is highly trained in Japanese kaiseki style dining and in the art of making sushi.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the nigiri course served here is one of the best in NYC.   Maybe the best rice period.\n\nBeen here several times and it keeps getting better.\n\nPS-The chef here is now Derek Wilcox, not that other guy. Yelp needs to delete all that old information, pics and reviews.  Derek is probably the best trained American in the art Japanese cooking.   7 years at the best restaurant in Japan, three Michelin star  Kikunoi learning the art of Kaiseki and then five years in Tokyo learning sushi at legendary Sushi Aoki, resulting in his own pop up sushi bar in Ginza sponsored by Chef Aoki.   He knows his stuff.", "Came here pre covid last year and forgot to leave a review! My boyfriend and I have been to a fair share of omakase restaurants over the past few years. This place was great! They only have counter seating, no tables, so it was nice and quaint.\n\nWe both loved how the ginger was diced up in cubes, rather than slices. It was our first time eating it like that and wow, it was amazing! Every piece we got tasted super fresh and delicious. I enjoyed the fire fly squid! It was the first time I had that.\n\nThe price tag is a little steep here though, which is the only reason I would be hesitant on coming back.", "Chief Shion is definitely one of the best Omasake Chief in the states.

Because like so many others, we'll be back.  \n5 stars.", "Great food and top notch service!We had no reservations and they were able to host us though they were very busy.\n\nFor appetizer we ordered buratta with tomatoes and peaches which was fabulous and the gnocci.( Ah-mazing) . The soft egg kind of becomes the sauce to it and though I was a bit hesitant to have the egg in that way, the server told me that the egg is actually cooked! but it's cooked in such a low temperature for such a long time that makes it be so soft and runny! it was really good. We ordered beef bourgunion ( short rib) which was great as well. The skate Wing fish was really tasty but a tad oily. For dessert, we had the chocolate mousse and though I was very full from eating so much, I licked the cup! it's a must try!", "Easily my favorite restaurant in Downtown Palo Alto. The food is fantastic (we had the mushroom soup, the bone marrow, seared scallops, short rib bourgogne, the cr\u00e8me caramel, and the almond cake) and the service helpful, friendly, and familiar but not obnoxious. The atmosphere is loud, but if you're parents who have gotten used to eating at 6:30 instead of 8:00, it's nice and quiet until the dinner rush sets in. Go go go.", "What a wonderful dinner. We went for an anniversary, and we were not let down.\n\n- Service\nIncredible service. Servers are really helpful and have great insights into the menu. It wasn't even a minute after we finished our glasses of water before they were immediately refilled. They even gave us free dessert for the anniversary!\n\n- Food\nThe food was wonderful. A bit pricey, but honestly worth the price. Zola has a mastery of French flavors that resonate close to what I've had in Paris but with an essence of modern contemporary influence. The Foie Gras is amazing, but the real standout was the seared duck breast. So many great flavors. The vegetables and jus were nice and light. The duck breast was meaty and rich, contrasting nicely with the garnish. A must get!", "I would say this is maybe 3.75 stars...not quite 4, but pretty good. Overall food is pretty good, generally good flavors, portions somewhat on the smaller side.\n\nStarted with the beet salad which was very light and with really nice texture with some crunchy bits. The bread and the compound butter is really tasty. Ordered the gnocchi which seemed like a must have and I found it a little overly greasy (with the brown butter sauce) and also the gnocchi were a bit big and more doughy than I would have liked. I would give that dish 3 stars. Then I finished with the beef tartare which was delicious! Paired with perfectly toasted thin baguette chips. The beef itself  was light, tender and very flavorful. Really fantastic dish! Only issue is it's a bit on the pricey side for a relatively small portion at $17.\n\nService was good, attentive and friendly.

It is served with a side of pico de gallo, a slice of avocado and a lime on the side. It's so good in a homey way.  I also ordered the Mixta and Poseidon tostadas.  The mixta's fresh flavors come through, with big pieces of shrimp and octopus.

Decided to finally try it this past Thursday afternoon around 12:30pm, I expected a lot of people but was relieved that there was only a few people. The girl at the register asked my husband and I if it was our first time and we said yes so she offered us each a free taco!

I ordered the mixta and the campechana and both were full of flavor and still remained light and fresh. It was great. They piled on the seafood mix on the tostada so most of it falls off, but they have extra tostada shells you can grab to eat the rest that fell on the plate.

One side of rice per 2 people is more than enough and one noodle dish for 4 people with 3 meat dishes will make you feel beyond full.

A nice, warm,clean, brightly lit, spot serving mostly delicious ethnic cuisine at fair prices. Sweet young couple own and run the place. The owner runs over comp shots of delicious Soplica infused vodka to those waiting for tables.The pierogis and borscht here are first rate. The borscht comes with either dumplings or a ginormous croquette, outstanding. The pierogis are handmade, served fresh steamed, savory or sweet. Savory would be Russkie (potato and cheese) sauerkraut and mushroom, or spiced meat. Another pierogi option would be sweet, and that would come filled with fresh fruit. Both savory and sweet: superb. The only thing that needs work would be the Nalesniki (aka crepes or blintzes) which were undercooked and overstuffed with runny liquid cheese. The servers could also use a little training on setting the table and running the food etc. I'm sure these issues, commonplace in a brand new spot, will be worked out.\nI would advise treating the place as a \"Polish Tea Room\", a place to hang out and grab a snack in the \"in between\" hours. It would be nice if they decided to expand the menu and their hours of operation. There are certainly enough bars and clubs nearby to support that.", "The food here is made with love and care, and the staff are very fun to be around as well. I love both dining in and taking out of Pierozek, knowing that the food will be fresh regardless of which I choose. I enjoy all of the savory pierogi, especially the sauerkraut/mushroom and spinach filling. As far as sweet pierogi go, I have a penchant for the raspberry and sweet cheese pierogi. The borscht is also so full of flavor and hearty, especially if you can drink it while it's hot.\n\nI also want to shout out the owner who, when an Uber Eats order went wrong (they never picked up my order from the restaurant), called me and offered to drive my order over to me in Long Island City. When you care about your customers enough to do something like this, your business deserves to thrive.", "This place is delicious and has a homey feel. The menu is small but every item is so well done--and each type of pierogi is stuffed to the brim with spinach, or mushroom and sauerkraut, meat, or one of my favorites--jalape\u00f1o and potatoes and cheese, cooked in an aldente, buttery pasta peel. They are so sumptuous and tasty and I feel like I shouldn't be saying this but they might be better than Chinese dumplings (a lot for me to say given I'm Chinese).... The meat and rice stuffed cabbage was also so special especially with the mushroom sauce. Really great find", "Such a lovely looking restaurant, I can't wait for them to be able to utilize their dining room again, but they do offer a garden out back as well as some curbside tables.  We ordered take-out.  While ordering we mentioned that we would need to reheat it later and the guy was very accommodating to that and even told us the best way to reheat the pierogi.  \n\nAnyway we opt'd for the kielbasa entree which comes with 3 pierogies and 2 additional orders of pierogi.   The kielbasa was a very good version, not overly salty with great flavor.  The meat pierogies, made with pork shoulder were quite good.  The potato and cheese version were silky and creamy, topped with some caramelized onions and delicious.  The jalapeno were equally good with a nice spicy kick and topped with bacon.  The dill sour cream adds a little pizzazz to the pierogies.\n\nDinner at home was excellent and enjoyable thanks to Pierozek!", "What a wonderful find in the neighborhood. We waited about 30 minutes for a table, which is normal in this area. But the food was well worth the wait. Pierogis perfectly seasoned and cooked, with dough thin and also delicate. Meat croquet is to die for and sweet cheese blintzes brought my wife into orgazmik state. All that coupled with a shot of ice cold Zubrovka and great service and  and you have two bevouted customers.\nWe will definately come back.", "As a native Pole and pierogi connoisseur I can assure you that Pierozek is the real deal!\nI traveled almost an hour from Manhattan just to see what this place has to offer and my food quest paid off indeed. Upon arrival I was greeted by a pleasant waitress and presented with a short but quite solid menu. My friend and I decided on a savory mix of potato & cheese and sauerkraut & mushroom filled pierogi, red borscht and mushroom croquette which are Christmas essentials in Poland.\nEverything we ordered had a great presentation and was incredibly delicious. In fact, it was a nostalgic experience as the flavors brought back memories of my childhood.\nPierozek has kept its promise of bringing authentic and delicious Polish fare to New York.\n\nCongratulations to the owners on this lovely place. Will be back soon!", "Polish restaurants are quickly disappearing from Greenpoint so I am glad that Pierozek opened up. It's a cute place with Boleslawiec pottery as tableware. It's new, fresh and clean interior albeit a little narrow. It's definitely not too for large groups.\n\nThe menu is small but that's all you need. A few soups, a few croquettes and crepes and glorious Pierogi. Because the menu is a small, they churn out huge quantities of dumplings that you can watch being boiled though a glass window in the dining rooms.\n\nThe quality of food was excellent. We loved the potato and cheese Pierogi, sauerkraut Pierogi, mEat croquette and the barszcz.\n\nThe portions and sufficient to fill up. The prices are low. This reminds me somewhat of the old school \"bar mleczny\" that you can still find in some Polish towns.\n\nThey get our seal of approval. The only minus was that the Pierogi are only served boiled - no fried ones. That is just a minor minus aaa the boiled Pierogi come with some caramelized onions on top.", "Elevated traditional Polish food!  Food is bursting with flavor and just really good.  The chef uses herbs really well here.  We had golabki and kielbasa, and both were exceptional.\n\nInsider's Tip: The restaurant no longer serves alcohol (early November 2020) which is a bummer.

Come summer, the party is further back out on the well-tended patio.\nBring friends because this food is meant to be shared, like hearty empanadas stuffed with mushroom and spinach or filet and olives. Black rice with grilled prawn and fried calamari is a seafood thrill; though the hulking double-cut pork chop, cooked to a juicy medium-rare and served with mustard greens is most impressive.

We started with the duck confit empanada (the crab one is also excellent having had it before) and arroz negro, both of which were out of this world.\n\nThe chicken Milanese Napolitana is incredible and so much food! Only able to have half. My wife had the 30 day dry aged NY strip which was cooked perfectly and so full of flavor with the pommes pur\u00e9e, the side salad it comes with is always amazingly dressed.\n\nWent with 4/5 stars as the food and drinks were 5/5, service was backed up but we also didn't receive one of our sides and our server never came back until we finished eating whether to check on us or if everything came out okay.\n\nOverall would continue to visit as we've always had a good experience here and the food is some of the best in the neighborhood.", "We finally got to try this new Argentinian steakhouse (opened 2 months before the pandemic shut down) in the neighborhood.\nI like the chic interior exposed brick wall design, and at the back they have a lovely patio with heaters. The staffs were super friendly.\nNow onto the food! I love the smoky charcoal grilled flavor.\nMy husband and I tried 3 appetizers - choripan\n(chorizo, garlic aioli on sourdough), arroz negro\n(whole prawn, fried calamari, saffron aioli) delicious! And al cuchillo (filet mignon) empanadas, very flavorful.\nWe shared a 16oz 30 day dry aged NY strip with a side of papas provencal\n(french fries, garlic, parsley). The steak was perfectly cooked as we like and the smoky taste...yum!\nWe were so full and didn't have room for dessert. Well, there's always next time!", "The Madera family produced an absolute home-run with R40. Everything from the decor, lighting, music and ambience - down to the service and food. Dishes are executed to perfection.\n\nThe menu had the right amount of choices that will make you curious enough for repeat visits.\n\nStarting with the clams, these were incredibly delicious. The light aromatic broth, the fresh clams and that amazing sour dough bread to soak.\n\nThe highlight of the night was the prawn and fried calamari with black ink risotto. This was just amazing. You can see people's faces light up with a smile once they take that first bite. That was the same reaction we had. Honestly, a dish like this was something that we've only experienced in 2-3 star Michelin restaurants abroad. The taste  is phenomenal.\n\nThe parillada is what you'd expect. Lots of meat, cooked medium rare. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the sweet bread. Never been too crazy about blood sausage. The salad it comes with helps break up the amount of meat on the platter.\n\nGarlic fries are top notch.\n\nIf new businesses in LIC can learn from R40, then we can finally have a good community of dining.", "I could not be happier to dine out for the first time in almost 5 months with this outdoor experience! Their back outdoor dining area is a slice of heaven and all tables safely spaced apart. We went there to celebrate our anniversary last night and boy did they make us feel special. Complimentary sparkling rose when we first sat down, dessert on the house and even two tastings of a delicious 100% Malbec desert wine at the end. Service was impeccable. Everyone was masked and food was served with gloves. we even exited out the back to avoid walking back through the restaurant! Food was so delicious - empanadas to die for. Really felt like we were dining at a hot new restaurant in Manhattan. Im so happy they are in LIC! Will be back many more times!", "Noise level unbearable.  Prices aren't inexpensive.  Food is very average.  Not bad...certainly not great.  Dry pork chop.  Crab empanada... nothing more than a large fried wonton stuffed with a mayo-laden concoction. Salad simple and quite good.   Service attentive, yet disorganized.  Way too long an interval between courses.  Guessing most people will try once and move on.   Hope it improves", "Was immediately drawn by the impressive windows. Loved the energy, as soon as we walked in the music and lighting makes you feel at ease. The hostess led us to a great table that let us appreciate all aspects of the place. Open kitchen, visible wine cellar and impressive bar. Brianna was our waitress and she knew it all! Her suggestions were on point. HIGHLY recommend the beet salad and black rice. The parrillada for two was SO good. I was full but I could not stop eating it. The portions are generous so come hungry. Can't wait to go back tonight to try the whole chicken.", "Delicious food, in a beautiful setting. Came on a Wednesday and while it was busy, it wasn't packed. We saw on their back patio which had really great music playing and mood lighting. Service was top notch the whole night.\n\nMy friend and I split the spinach and cheese empanada, mushroom tagliatelle, and the provenzal fries. We also got a couple glasses of wine and cocktails. All the dishes were stellar. The empanada wasn't the traditional dough. It was more of a puff pastry but still delicious and the filling is heavenly. The mushroom tagliatelle must have had at least three different types of mushrooms and the sauce was rich yet not too heavy. Noodles were a little al dente for me but still enjoyable. If you get the fries you definitely have to love garlic because they pile it on but I love copious amounts of garlic so that worked for me! They were a medium cut and stayed crispy even as we munched on them throughout the night.\n\nWine was amazing and they had an interesting variety of grapes that I don't see as commonly. The cocktails were just ok in my opinion. Nothing amazing.", "This place is fantastic. I've lived in LIC for over 7 years and this is the best meal that I have had in the neighborhood.

The fried rice was SO good, the chili wontons were the right level of spicy, and the walnut shrimp was unique and very tasty. The eggplant was also good, but it was super oily when you bit into it, which took away from the flavor a bit.

I seriously don't understand why it took this restaurant 2 hours to prepare a small pick up order!!! The dine in customers who arrived later than we did already finished their dinner when we finally picked up our order at 9pm. We called them 3 times and they kept over promising! They kept saying the order will be ready in 10-15 minutes, but in reality we waited in our car for more than an hour outside the restaurant. I don't understand why they had to keep lying to us.

My family and I literally come here every week and the waiters/waitresses pretty much know us. J Zhou Oriental Cuisine is the perfect place to grab Sunday dim sum. The decor, food, and service of this place definitely tops other places by far. While pricier, I would say it is definitely worth the money and the experience if you have yet to try this place!\n\nFrom the dim sum, our favorites are definitely:\n- Steamed Preserved Salty Egg Yolk Buns\n- Enoki Mushroom Dumplings\n- Eggplant Stuffed with Fish Paste in Soy Sauce\n- Fresh Shrimp Dumplings with Chives\n\nIn general, the dim sum here is really high quality in comparison to other places. It seems like there is not really much of a difference in terms of other dim sum places (they all taste about the same), but this place actually is GOOD. There's something about the skin of the dim sum (be it baked/fried/steamed, it's all high quality), or the filing (really flavorful ingredients used and also extremely fresh). There has YET to be one item that I've disliked, so just be adventurous and order what you like!\n\nI'll see you next week on Sunday, J Zhou.", "We \"sniffed in\" for dim sum and the food was a 4.5 star affair...\n\nThe SERVICE is absent at times but you can usually flag someone down fairly easily.  The cart concept was vetoed some time back so you simply order off a nice menu with great photos.  The place is very fancy on the interior with ornate wood wall panels, thick carpet with designs, elegant chairs etc.\n\nThe SHU MAI were pretty good, not the best I've had but quite tasty.  \n\nThe SAUTEED PORK PIECES were very moist but a bit greasy for me.  \n\nThe EGG TARTS had a glossy shine to the interior yellow egg.  The crust wasn't as multi-layered and flaky as at 85C but the crust was very tasty anyway.  The egg custard was likely leaning toward lightly sweet.  There was a firmness to the egg center and overall this was a tasty pastry (served in sets of 3).  The crust isn't browned but is more of a neutral color.\n\nBEEF CONGEE -- my stomach is still recovering from a recent illness so this is my main course today; moderately thick slices of beef; very hot congee porridge; this is just what the doctor ordered; a pleasant dish when you're trying to get back on track\n\nThe JASMINE HOT TEA is a little light on the aroma of jasmine but otherwise okay.", "Not good, even by Irvine standards. Saturday dim sum was pretty much wide open until noon, then there was somewhat of a small wait. I can see why. Maybe only a few items on the dim sum list that were alright. The majority of them weren't good, and the selection is very small for a restaurant of this size. Also, no carts. I'd never pick this place, but maybe traditional lunch or dinner is better.\n\nI actually didn't think the service was too bad. Certainly not as good as the inside of the restaurant would make you think, but passable on the traditional Chinese restaurant scale.", "The decor is dominated by a seemingly endless amount of blown glass fixtures on the ceiling. It's a little bit over the top but also beautiful. The entrance features a showcase of high end Bordeaux and Napa wines that are there to impute the idea of luxury.\n\nThis isn't a chef driven restaurant with luxurious food though. It's well executed classic Chinese food. So the decor and ambiance they are trying to deliver is a bit of a juxtaposition.\n\nThe quality of the dim sum is especially good. Rather than choose from carts you order what you want a la carte. You end up with hot, delicate and fresh dim sum plates - no rubbery chicken feet.\n\nThe service is terrible however. Staff is rude. Their reservation system is dubious. Sometimes they will accept reservations and sometimes not. During weekend dim sum the front of the restaurant is a chaotic mob of people with tables sometimes being assigned in an arbitrary manner. The wait staff do not understand how to offer quality service. For an establishment trying to present the aura of luxury and charging a premium for Chinese food, they have no basic understanding of what high end restaurant service is.", "I was impressed by the restaurant look from the outside--the magnificent ancient red Chinese door with the two guardian lions. As I walked inside, I was more impressed by the interior and decoration. But the whole experience was not as excited as I would expect. They have a lovely carpet, but it needs to be clean or change. I love dim sum, but J Zhou doesn't meet my standard for a reasonable dim sum. The service was good. The manager greeted us and was so friendly. We are a party of nine at two separate tables. We asked for the bill to be split per table, but they failed to do so. When we ask for the bill for our table only, the waiter gave us the total bill yet insisted that it was only for our table. Since none of us can read Chinese characters (the bill is in Chinese), the confusion was finally solved once we pointed out the number of cups of tea that they charged.", "Like Capital Seafood, this establishment is a Chinese restaurant with a high-end appearance. The decorations here are even better than those in Capital Seafood with shiny walls and many bowls and a very high ceiling with red chandeliers.\n\nThe food here is unique, as we all tried something that we had never tried before (inclusive of the tourist friend I brought). Although somewhat oily, it was different. The rest of the offerings my party served were standard fare that can be ordered elsewhere and were also as oily as other locations (and I did notice another tea bath that someone had made for the food).\n\nHowever, they didn't honor our coupon, saying it was for dim sum only.

One of my favorite memories of Barcelona was getting pinxtos in hole in the wall tapas places so I was ecstatic to see it on the menu here. Here's what we got:\n\n- All 6 pinxtos - if you're a party of two, they are perfect to split, one bite each. LOVED the duck croqueta and squash blossom, the liver mousse, eggplant and sardine and radish were great, and the gilda was fine.\n- Rojo - such a fun dish! It's spiralized potatoes in a delicious meat sauce with a runny egg on top that you mix in like a korean bibimbop. Lovely.\n- Salpicon - very refreshing, summer-y dish. Bright and citrus-y with great seafood.\n- Arroz a la Nicoise - I love rice and they had a wonderful addition of crispy rice at the bottom of the dish. The tuna, although it looks the kind that comes out of a can, is so delicious (pretty sure it doesn't come from a can).\n- Zamburinas - this was a different kind of dish, marinated scallops in tomato sauce. If you're feeling up for something a little different and adventurous, this is a great one!\n\nOverall, fantastic tapas/Spanish food that is reminiscent of Spain. Love it!", "Huertas serves Basque food.  Service was pretty good on the one hand, they accomodated my late arrival (there was an issue changing my reservation in the Resy app) but on the other hand they didn't answer the phone when I tried calling back and our second round of drinks sat on the bar for about ten minutes before someone noticed and brought them over. Food was pretty tasty, maybe a bit on the salty side but I may be sensitive to that since unlike most Americans, I don't eat a lot of processed food. I really liked the sardine presentation with salted butter, radishes, parsley, and crusty bread. The Manchego was good although I would have liked more cheese and fewer crackers. The shisito peppers were maybe a bit much--tasty but a bit one-note to have a whole dish of. I liked the fried rice, kind of like shrimp paella but with aioli although again it was a bit salty. My favorite dish was the pinxto (Basque tapas) of the day, some kind of fried fish with chickpeas and a delicious mayo-based sauce. The overall vibe was cool and even though service is included, the prices were not overly high.", "We were going to a show a few blocks away at the Public Theater and ended up here randomly after a 90 minute wait at another local place. It could not have been a happier accident!! We love eating tapas and sitting here at the bar and then a high-top, this had the feel of being back in Barcelona. The drinks were delicious and the food was excellent. The octopus was perfectly cooked as were the meatballs and the potato strands with the runny egg on top. Each dish was perfect in size for tapas style sharing and let us try lots of different items without feeling overly stuffed. After reading lots about restaurants moving this direction, this was our first experience at a \"no tipping\" establishment. The service was impeccable - from the host to the bartender to the waiter, everyone was friendly and very attentive to everything.

My boyfriend and I came here to try the $52 four course prix fixe menu del dia.  He did the drink pairing with the four courses for a total of $82.  \n\nWe had the chance to experience several different pintxos, including an anchovy with olive and pepper, a seafood salad, and sopressata on bread with honey.  We enjoyed the egg over asparagus and bread crumbs and shared our main dishes of lamb and lamb leg with grilled veggies and arroz (rice) with mushroom and sauce that resembled paella without the meat.  The dessert we chose was the chocolate turon and blue cheese with apple sauce.  Overall, I highly recommend trying the lamb and the (vegetarian option) arroz with mushrooms.  \n\nThe decor of the front room is casual but hip, with mood-lighting and nice ambiance.  The front room serves more of the pintxos, smaller plates with drinks.  The back room, where they focus on dinner, reminds me of a cozy and comfortable dining room.  The staff are all friendly, casually dressed and willing to tell you what each dish means and more.  \n\nOverall, it was delicious and a unique introduction to different pintxos (tapas), main course, and desserts.  Will come back to try the front room and the tapas that they serve.", "Huertas is a Basque-inspired bar and restaurant where I first learned to love conservas (canned Spanish seafood) and Spanish vermuth ( that's how they spell it). For those who are into tapas, this place should hit the spot. Small dishes called pinxos are passed around. The space is huge, and the open kitchen infuses the restaurant with a wonderful aroma. I find the generous room of the plays as one of the things that adds to the dining experience. I recommend sitting at the bar, unless you are with a large group. The bar does not serve hard liquor, but in addition to vermuth, they serve ciders, beers and sangria. Service is friendly. I'd give it a fifth star if they offered more variety in their entree selection, especially now that they serve regular meals at the bar. When the place opened, to get a proper meal, you had to have the tasting menu in their rear dining room. Huertas is definitely worth a visit", "Probably more deserving of a 4.5, if only those where doable, but service was truly best I've experienced in NYC.

Don't be afraid to use salt as it lacked flavor. This steak is served with fries and they were mediocre. Hubs ordered the burger and he enjoyed it but agrees the fries were meh. The burger is normally served with a salad and we requested a side if broccoli in place of the salad but his burger arrived with the fries instead so they didn't bring the broccoli until we were half way done with the meal.

My one complaint is that the plantains were SO SMALL (seriously, five measly pieces of plantains), but the flavors were so good that it was worth overlooking.", "Dos Urban Cantina is a really lovely space - the main dining room is marked by a kind of understated elegance (think gracious spacing between tables, and a white/brown color palette). The menu features Chicago-sized small plates (which is to say, not too small) and then some larger dishes (indicated by bold lettering on the menu).  We sampled the octopus (pineapple puree, adobo chicharron,\nshallot jam) which was delicious though I never tasted hints of pineapple; the sweet corn tamal; the grilled mushrooms (which is about half a plate of mushrooms and half a plate of mole); and the chicken in adobo.  Everything we sampled was really tasty, yet oddly redundant- it felt like the menu has a few prevailing flavors and most things taste the same.", "One of my favorite experiences ever! My boyfriend and his parents (who were in town for Mother's Day weekend) and I went to dinner here, and our waiter was SO knowledgeable and had the best recommendations.\n\nWe had Tamal Tots, Corn Tamal, and the Queso for appetizers and all 3 were so delicious.\n\nEach of our entree's we finished (even his mom who is the smallest eater ever!).

We caught the end of lunch period right before they close for the afternoon, so we didn't have to wait for long to get a seat, but I can imagine that it was packed at peak lunch time, so come prepared to wait.\n\nWe tried the Crispy Garlic Shishito Peppers and they were soooooo goood! There are little razor sliced pieces of garlic fried and sprinkled over the top of the peppers with a dark sauce underneath and just the right amount of spice.\n\nThe Tokyo Tonkotsu ramen is hands down THE BEST ramen I have had anywhere in this city. The broth is so flavorful and creamy you could drink it by itself and be happy. The house-made noodles are fresh and there is a good amount of pork and veggies as well. Every bite was a beautiful experience.\n\nI highly recommend that you come here immediately for a meal.", "The Miso Ginger Ramen has my heart and it's my FAV ramen in the city\n\nI usually only order spicy ramen but one time I was here with my friend who ordered the Miso Ginger Ramen and I was converted. It's so delicious and it's also vegan.\n\nI was recently here with my friend for his birthday dinner so we went all out and ordered 3 appetizers: tonchin chicken tsukune bun, fried fish and spicy miso bun, and tonchin spicy chicken wings. The buns were really good - my fav was the fried fish one. The spicy chicken wings were good too but I would say a bit too overseasoned with pepper. It's good to share since you'll get tired of the flavor after a couple of wings.\n\nWe finished off with mango milk shaved ice. The honey cream sauce that it's topped with is the best thing ever. I prefer the matcha milk shaved ice over the mango one though.", "Ate here last night before taking in the Raconteurs show at the Hammerstein Ballroom - easily walk-able, great choice for dinner. My wife and I both ordered the classic Tonkotsu ramen with edamame and gyoza starters. Everything was a notch above a standard ramen experience. Great vibe in the house. Edamame were steamed perfectly and flavored with great hints of umami. The gyoza came out sizzeling in a small cast iron pan and the spicy dipping sauce was perfect.\n\nI have a favorite ramen that i judge all others by - Silver Lake Ramen in LA and let me tell you, the Tonchin ramen gave Silver Lake a run for its money - I think the Tonchin ramen is Silver Lake's east coast equal, but both are unique. In the case of Tonchin the thinly sliced pork made eating it much easier and the pork was so tender, like thinly sliced roast beef in au jus - and the broth was rich, silky creamy - well balanced.  Tonchin ramen was perfectly balanced, the amounts in the bowl were well suited and not over whelming. Egg was cooked just right. Looks like i have a must have ramen place on both coasts now! If you are a ramen fan, go here now...", "Came by on a Sunday night around 530pm and we (party of 3) were seated right away. The ambience was classy and sleek with high ceilings. The staff was very attentive and efficient. We started off with the chicken wings and oh my goodness, it was so so so delicious!! The wings were well seasoned with teriyaki and peppercorn which gave that kick of spice but not too much and leaving you wanting for more. You can really taste the freshness of the chicken and it was a great start to our meal. Next came the ramen. I ordered the smoked dashi ramen. The broth was what stood out to me the most. It was very rich and savory with a kick of smokiness. They gave a ton of clams which was a nice surprise. The noodles are also made in house which gives it the authenticity I really liked. We were too full to order dessert but we saw other diners with shaved ice which looked really yummy. Overall a very wonderful dinner experience and will be back.", "Overall a very good experience. Would give 5 stars for the food and service for sure. Did not go for the ramen this time, and opted for the Kale salad and the original Tonchin Meguro (tuna mix wrapped with seaweed and lettuce). Both were delicious. Our waiter was very helpful and patient during our stay and meticulously explained the menu and our orders. Also had a chance to taste the ramen broth for the original tonchin tonkatsu ramen, and the broth tasted very rich, but not overly salty.\n\nThe one downside is they do not do reservations for parties under 4 unfortunately. It wasn't a long wait walking in on a Tuesday night, but would've liked the option to secure a table especially if we knew exactly what time we were going to eat.\n\nWould probably return in the future to have the ramen.", "I've been here a couple of times already and this restaurant never disappoints. Every person I've been here with had only good things to say about it, whether it was how GOOD the ramen was (an obvious one) or how nice the atmosphere was.\n\nI usually get the vegan miso ginger ramen which has such a complex flavor for a vegan ramen. Other people have tried it with me and agreed that it holds its own with the other pork based ramens. The noodles are also amazing and has a nice chew to them.\n\nThe intimate, dimly lit environment makes it great for date night or dinner with a friend.

Am a huge lamb fan and tend to be a little picky about it, but needless to say, the food (including the garlic lamb skewers) was amazing. Not only did the food looks good, but they also took care on the presentation as well. Would definitely recommend the GArlic lamb skewers for anyone who wants to check this place out (Caution: some people tend to find it a little spicy).\nThe only thing that I saw was a little lacking was the serving aspect, even on a relatively slow Sunday Afternoon, with not too many customers in, the service seemed to be little slow (the old lady at the cashier counter was pretty cool though).\nOverall, I would say that if you are in that area, definitely give this place a shot.", "Food was delicious, cheap and is more on the savory/sweeter side.

Delicious as well, but won't order again since I can make this at home.\n-Caramelized spare ribs clay pot: come w/ the thick bottom crispy rice, sure delicious...

The ambience was so cozy and beautiful and perfect for Christmastime. There is no other place like this in Chicago as far as I know.

There is a waiting area with comfy chairs and sofas to hangout before you are seated. There were about 13 tables and lighting is romantic. Starters were very tasty. We got the aranchini and artichoke- highly recommend! They have pastas, chicken, seafood, and beef dishes. All of the food is thoughtfully prepared and every bite is full of Italian flavors and delivers. Portions are a good size. The food was so good that you do want to try more than 1 entree/plate. Service was attentive and they dont pressure you to get more. Save room for dessert and try their carefully crafted cocktails and coffee beverages! Really a special Italian restaurant that goes above and beyond. This has definitely moved to one of the top of my lists of top Italian restaurants in Chicago!", "My favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago!

Salad with the peppers and sausage was so simple yet satisfying.\n\nOur waitress was so so kind and could tell how indecisive I was on menu so brought out a little sampler of the other dish I was between when the main courses came.

I am very adventurous with my food and always love to try new things which is why I ordered a duck egg pizza, with the egg being cooked within and on the pizza as well as steak and eggs. For starters I chose the small pastry's or doughnuts, which I would definitely recommend with Nutella as well! For my brunch the duck egg pizza with arugula is served very nicely and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food overall. I would recommend the pizza as well as the Parmesan steak and eggs served with a small salad and rye toast. This is perfect for an Mid morning meal as it had all the necessary things for my day, not only tasting amazing as well as coming out fresh and warm. Love and salt is on the more expensive side of brunch locations in the South Bay however in my opinion I have been to many brunch spots in my area and this is one of the best as I know I am paying for quality and fresh food.

Since the moment you enter, you can feel the positive energy.\nFood is so good. I like the simply shaved fennel salad, it's just fennel with olive oil and black pepper, simple but exquisite.\nOther salad option is the Freekehlicious salad, the combination of grains, herbs a and radish is delightful.\nThe roasted mushroom pizza is a staple item, that I will always have when I come here. The pizza is cooked perfectly.\nI also like oven roasted asparagus. The trout is good too.\nHouse picked vegetable is so so. I'm not fond of pickles. Too strong for my liking.", "First time customer.

Once considered one of LA's most dodgy parts, downtown slowly began picking up during our time in LA with hot new restaurants, shops and businesses. Then COVID hit, and like many people in LA, we stopped going there. But it's coming back. We were incredibly excited to see that Redbird, one of our favorite restaurants, managed to make it work and remain open through most of the pandemic with outdoor seating. Recently, they brought back their brunch menu and we had to check it out and even brought the kids.\n\nWe joined Redbird for a special Easter brunch, and enjoyed a three course meal. The restaurant offers a variety of seating options including in their garden (a quiet and romantic section of the restaurant). We opted for the courtyard seating, which is by the inner bar with a retractable roof. This is great if you want a livelier meal or if you have screaming kids. The energy of the room, nearly drowned them out.\n\nReservations can be made directly on the Redbird website. Reservations are highly recommended since the restaurant is regularly booked several days in advance (or weeks out if there is a special celebration or holiday).", "Incredible and soulful food befitting LA's dining identity,  I cannot seem to get enough of Redbird.  I'm so into this restaurant, I have to tear myself away from Redbird because my brain goes on auto-pilot to come here everytime I want to go out and eat.  Not good.  Service is superb and friendly.  The plates are appropriately global,  melds multi-cultural flavors into a delicious plate.  Fusion?  No, that's played out.  Global? Yes.   Everything works on a plate concocted by Mr. Fraser.  So this is a good reference point if you are considering dining here.    Another great part to dining here is the excellent and consistent pastry chef .  I've had about 8 desserts by Kasra Adjari and they are in my opi, original and delishush.    The last dessert I sampled (well twice now), a yuzu custard with cucumber sorbet in a basil broth was a dessert verging on sublime. Nope.

I think the sign of an excellent bartender is someone who can mix a non-alcoholic cocktail that is beautiful, delicious, and subtle in its flavors, without being too sweet.\n\nHowever, on the past three occasions I've been, the service has lagged at the end, creating a long wait to order dessert and for the check (as well as water glasses remaining empty). Not a problem when lingering over dinner, but a bit of an issue when needing to get back to work in a timely fashion. On one of the occasions, they did comp dessert to apologize for the wait, which was a nice touch. But hopefully they can work on this in the future.", "What a great restaurant!

They also have a large variety of vegetarian options, which is hard to find at dim sum restaurants. The mushroom noodle roll, mushroom bun, vegetable dumpling, red bean buns, all delicious. The mushroom bun was pan-fried and pretty oily, though. My favorite was definitely the mushroom noodle roll, with the red bean bun in close second.\n\nThey don't come around with the carts, you circle what you want on the menu, which I think is really fun so that was a little disappointing, but the food was tasty and much fresher.

There's a wait here like many others, but their turnover rate is pretty fast because they different parties of people at the same tables. I recommend choosing what you want with the menu and sharpie that they provide while you wait in line to be seated. The thing to order here are the baked bbq pork buns, because they make it differently than most. However, their pork isn't always freshly cooked. Their peking duck was pretty good too - lots of meat and nicely crispy skin. The buns get soggy because of the duck fat near it. Shanghai soup dumplings, steamed spare ribs and the pea sprouts are good here too. Lots of patrons here and it's definitely lively.

They had some really unique dishes I've never seen before and great presentation on some of the dishes.

Their ordering system has been streamlined (they no longer only use carts but employ a checklist of dishes from a list).  Phoenix is also (and always) a great destination for dinner.  Beef with shallots is a favorite of mine, as well as their sea bass, which can be prepared different ways.  The peking duck, if willing to pay the price, is a delicious main course to share with a group.  It is offered as a two course dish with the first being freshly sliced and the second being a stir-fry.  The abalone, which is quite pricey as expected, is very fresh and definitely worth a try.

In case there's anyone who needs convincing, here's my take.\n\nIt's the cleanest place you can have dim sum in Chicago.  The restaurant is well run, you get your water and tea quickly.  If you drop something on the ground(not food), you will not have to worry about it being dirtier because of the carpet.  Those who frequent ChinaTown restaurants know what I mean.  \n\nThey have very good quality standards: har gow, shu mai, char sui bow, etc.\n\nMy favorites there are: bean curd roll(pork, bamboo shoots, shrimp inside tofu skin, braised in a tasty brown sauce),  stuffed eggplant with shrimp, pan fried chive dumpling, curry steamed baby squid, preserved egg pork congee.\n\nMy Hong Kong sidekick best friend's favorite are: shrimp rice roll and turnip cake.  \n\nHer husband loves: black bean garlic steamed sparerib, BBQ pork pastry.\n\nMy super bf's favorites are: xiao long bao and taro ball.\n\nThe wait on Sunday is long enough.  Try to go on Saturday so you don't jam up the wait for me on Sunday.  \n\nKaren", "I have been here multiple times, for dim sum and for dinners that range from casual family gatherings to wedding receptions. The dim sum is okay for what it is, but there are too many fried items in an attempt to cater to tourists or people unfamiliar with dim sum. Dim sum can be a little greasy - nothing cups of tea won't fix - so offering a lot of fried items ruins the balance of things. If you are looking for a classic cart experience though, this is the place. Most are now going by the menu.\n\nThat said, their dinners are very good if you order right. Never had American-Chinese food here, so I can't comment on that, but they do a decent Chinese dinner. Nothing crazy outstanding, just well executed Cantonese food.\n\nOne advantage of Phoenix over other restaurants is its size. We recently celebrated my parents' 30th wedding anniversary with over 70 people. We took up half the restaurant. They were pretty accommodating and the price was not bad for feeding that many folks.", "I'm Chinese and have been to Phoenix about 100 times.

We ordered many of the traditional entrees - pot stickers, hot & sour soup, crispy chicken, stir fired lobster with ginger, beef & broccoli. walnut shrimp, and slice fish over pea-shoots. Everything was excellent. Phoenix serves traditional high quality Chinese entrees. I know their service can be very uneven as with most Chinese restaurants - most just don't understand marketing and westernized service. Been there for dim sum also - very good. I do wish the carts are wheeled around evenly. Sometimes it can be difficult to get the mini-entrees that you love. Get there before 10 am on weekend or be prepared to wait in line.", "This restaurant is in the heart of Chinatown in Chicago with a huge advertisement saying they were a Michelin Recommended Restaurant.

You have to get the pan fried buns, the braised beef brisket tomato noodle soup, and the soup dumplings with crab.  We also get the snow pea shoot with minced garlic for something green :).  The beef tomato noodle is rich and savory.  The portion is huge, good enough for 2 people if you have other food as well.  The pan fried buns are stuffed full of beef and crispy on the bottom.  Paired well with the vinegar, it's so satisfying.  The soup dumplings are awesome here and the flavor is legit, all without having to go into Flushing Chinatown.  This is definitely a spot that you need to check out.  During covid, they expanded their space so there's more distance between tables.  \n\nAlso check out their chicken curry dumplings, pork wonton in chili sauce, and their pan fried noodle with seafood.  Delicious!", "We have now come to Memories of Shanghai two times now and the second time just hooked us even more.\n\nFirst though, it is way down on Austin street. About a 10 minute walk from the subway. But it's worth it.\n\nThe dining room only sits a couple of people literally. And you're up close to where they are making the dumplings. That's very cool.\n\nI started off with a scallion pancake. Normally when I have had them they are always greasy. But it isn't here. It's so good!! I wish the sauce was a bit thicker but it's still delicious.\n\nJeffrey got the beef noodle soup and he had them make it very spicy. They really did. He actually started getting red in the face. Funny but worth it!!\n\nThen I got the shrimp dumplings. They were so good!! The shrimp was very large and the dumpling pastry was delicate. Just the way it's supposed to be.\n\nI wanted to try a sweet puff but I'm apprehensive as in almost every Chinese sweet party I have never found one yet that was sweet. Maybe next time I'll give it a chance.\n\nHey MOSH we will definitely be back!!!", "Memories of Shanghai is a new member to the Forest Hills food scene taking over the former residence that Tokyo Teriyaki occupied for as long as I can remember (RIP). I had heard good reviews from friends about this place and decided to give it a try on a cold rainy night. I was craving soup so we ordered the Beef Vermicelli soup, Wonton soup, and scallion pancakes. Hardly tasting the menu at all, but the soups were very good.  My only complaint about the soup would be that they were a bit heavy handed with the seaweed in the wonton soup. The scallion pancakes were some of the best I have eaten, and believe me, I am a huge scallion pancake fan.\n\nExcited to try the soup dumplings as those are next on my list.", "They moved to a new place, just few steps away from the old place.

The peppers were indeed sweet, and these tiny delicate little things unlike any I've had. The pizza also delivered the balance of sweet and savory sauce and cheese and a distinctive char on the crust. Similarly, some corn-based empanadas I ordered were nicely baked.\n\nThe place itself is a counter service model and it irks me a bit.

It was a double patty and went down easy, I'm sure that other people can eat two burgers when they come in hungry.

Everything was great!  Best Japanese food in Pasadena!", "Delicious sushi that melts in your mouth is the kind of treat you'll find at Osawa. I dined here recently with some friends. We decided midday on this place so we had no reservations on arrival, but they did not hesitate to seat us at an open table in the outside patio section.\n\nAfter ordering, the food arrived within 15 minutes. Everything was gorgeous! Definitely worth bringing out your phone and taking some pics. The taste was more than what we expected. All the sushi was the kind you'll remember and get cravings for. The salmon nigiri was some of the best I'd ever had: thick cuts of fresh fish with some perfectly-cooked rice. Who could ask for more?\n\nOsawa is definitely not the cheapest dinner I've had, but it may be one of the most memorable. I'd definitely recommend visiting this restaurant on a special night with people you love.", "It is nearly impossible to find anything to fault with the food offered by Osawa.  My only caveats have to do with the noise level and crowded venue, which are simply unavoidable consequences of being in a very high quality foodery in a small space.\n\nI was with a sophisticated party of three for food purposes.   We ordered a variety of menu items--two udon selections and a bento box.  We also shared two different desserts.   We all felt the food texture and quality were superb.   I particularly savored the salmon steak in my bento box selection.   One colleague mentioned the quality of the coconut broth in which his spicy green chili udon was served.   The other udon was based on chirashi, a Japanese assortment of fish and vegetables--also very tasty.  The garnishes were also fresh and pungent.\n\nThe dessert menu is eclectic--ranging from bread pudding to a yam brulee, and a black sesame panna cotta.  Mine was made from mochi balls covered with ice cream.  One thing that makes a good Japanese dessert is the ability to bring out a flavor without burying it in sweetness. These efforts did well at Osawa.  \n\nI'll have to come back several times to get the full range of possibilities here.  Oh well, I'll volunteer for this painful service!! :)", "Came here with a friend for Sunday lunch. She had said this place was previously another Japanese place that changed ownership a few years ago. Her first comment sitting down was actually, \"I trust this place because I hear a lot of people speaking Japanese, so it's gotta be authentic\". And authentic it was.\n\nWe ordered an two types of sashimi, the deluxe chirashi (a special for the day), and an assortment of sushi. Honestly I cannot really tell you what was what but everything was incredibly fresh. There was this one fatty salmon belly sushi I distinctly remember that melted in your mouth. It had red chili oil on it as well.\n\nThis place is apparently also know for Shabu Shabu but I didn't try it so I can't comment on it. However I think it's only available at the bar so plan accordingly.\n\nThe interior design is very classic Japanese with an assortment of wall pieces and ornaments.

If you are going for shabu shabu, you have to sit at the bar, so be sure to request that. We got shabu shabu and it was great! I got the spicy miso, and my date for the kombu broth. Thought it was kind of odd that we ordered from a waiter, who then immediately just repeated our order to the chef standing behind the counter. We could've just ordered directly and saved time?

If not dine here earlier during the week :)", "I would highly recommend making a reservation to this place. When I tried making a res for 3, the only options were for super late dinners (think 10:30 pm). But if you make a res far enough in advance (over a week in advance), you should be fine.\n\nFirst off, this restaurant is gorgeous. I love that you can see into the kitchen, and see all the chefs working. The ambiance is really great, too. They have the perfect music selection. The whole look of this restaurant ties in with the food. Everything is modern and elegant.\n\nFor starters, we had the levain with butter and deviled eggs. The deviled eggs are pretty much soft boiled eggs. The levain was really good, and the butter defied gravity. For my main entree, I had the petit filet, which came with green beans and a cauliflower pur\u00e9e. Everything was cooked perfectly, and the seasoning was just right. I was disappointed with the desserts, though. I tried the honey crumble pudding and the profiteroles. The desserts were on the dry side, and I like my desserts sweeter.", "Went there last night for a celebration dinner with my wife. This is the old Banker & Baker spot, which is tucked away in a quiet part of pacific heights. The food was excellent last night and the service was impeccable. The ambiance is also really cool given the open kitchen concept and very rustic furniture.\n\nWe had the oysters, deviled eggs, crab, squid ink noodles, pappardelle, duck breast, filet and then the honey crumble and angel cake for dessert (wow, that was a lot of food). Honestly, all of them were great but if I had to skip one it would be the crab and if I had to pick a favorite it would be the deviled egg.\n\nOnly downside to the place is that there's no where to wait inside or nearby if you show up early for your reservation, so just be aware of that.", "I'm so so lucky to have Octavia at the corner of my house! First time back here since the pandemic started and it kept its bar high. I love every single dish they present. Sharing is caring, so go there with a generous attitude! The small dishes were beautiful. Tomatoes were the freshest I've ever had. Their bread is to die for. Crab was good, rabbit rag\u00fa was a flavour bomb and their famous duck did not disappoint. The chocolate dessert they are famous for was worth every bite. Excellent wine selection, I had the Riesling with the crab. If you haven't gone there yet, please go. It's the translation of California farm to table and I'm happy they're back", "Octavia has become one of my favorite restaurants in SF. It's not located in a happening neighborhood. Located at the old Banker and Baker location on a residential corner in Lower Pac Heights, there won't be as many people walking by to check it out and put their name down, such as Rich Table in Hayes Valley. But their restaurant does fill up. Back to why the restaurant is one of my favorites, it boils down to the food. Location is not ideal, ambience is nice but a tad chilly on a cold day but the food is exceptional. While the menu is seasonal and changes on a regular basis, they do have staples and one of their staple dishes is the chilled squid ink noodles. Super refreshing with the amount of citrus they use. I also had the cauliflower appetizer which was scrumptious. The pasta dish was my least favorite of everything, but still really good! Lastly, I shared the duck and steak entrees which were my favorites. My date and I assumed the meat was sous vide then grilled since it was so tender so we asked the waitress to confirm our hypothesis. Wrong, no sous vide, just plain old fashion grilling by the owner chef. Damn, that was good.", "I like Frances a lot and when Octavia opened up, I knew I had to try it. The menu looked delicious. I wanted to order everything but I didn't. Started off with deviled egg. It's very simple. A soft boiled egg with tons of red pepper flakes. It was really missing the creamy component. I wish it had like creme fraiche. Halibut crudo, beef tongue, and chilled squid ink noodle were all decent but all these plates are super small to where there isn't more than a bit per person if you brought a date. If you was to get a salad, avoid the little gem salad. It is just lettuce wedges. Highlight of the meal was the corn soup (must get!). Creamy and screams corn. Shared the ribeye. Sad but that meat took about +20 minutes after our last dish and one side of it was charred and well done. I asked for medium rare! Didn't complain because I couldn't wait another +20 minutes. Just sliced off all the super charred edges and moved on. If I ever come back, I would avoid the entree all together and just order appetizers and do it tapas style."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/octavia-san-francisco?hrid=4bzutJGcdX4zFEbenHjCHg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/octavia-san-francisco?hrid=5ofvOHGMRafUWniGqPtRsg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/octavia-san-francisco?hrid=67PpUf89t7H9wLXzJt2Arw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/octavia-san-francisco?hrid=xiOu461adp89z4fma9UfEw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/octavia-san-francisco?hrid=Q1kooI0GKGW1Od_srWvrYg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/octavia-san-francisco?hrid=wkiVsoUo8zEPDcdSlU4Maw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Roberta's", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/robertas-brooklyn-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/roberta-s", "michelin_pov": "Entering through this (now) iconic red door is like a trip through the looking glass and into Bushwick\u2019s foodie wonderland.

Go on a sunny day so you can wait at one of the patio bar areas out back. The smells of fresh pizza are overwhelming. We were told, and ended up waiting, for 45 minutes for a table of 4 on a Sunday at 11:15am. FYI Bloody Mary's at the bar were ridiculously spicy, too much so. Once seated, we started with Stracciatella and crisp flatbread which was fresh, stringy and soft. We shared the meatball parm sandwich with some romaine hearts drenched in oil and vinegar on the side, as well as the bacon, egg and cheese croissant and fingerling potatoes. The meatballs were flavorful on a great crisped hero. The BEC sandwich was good, nothing mind blowing. A friend got the Little Stinker Pizza. Honestly, I wouldn't rate their pizza as the best ever in NYC. Not even top 5 I've had in NYC. But it was crisp and yummy. All in all, Roberta's has now become a Bushwick mainstay and a Brooklyn icon. It's worth a trip to see what all the fuss is about.", "I've been here twice now and the pizza is so amazing - it never disappoints! I think both times I got the bee sting and the beast master, both of which I highly recommend. The bee sting is soppresata with honey drizzled over it... Yum. The beast master is more savory and spicy, with capers and jalape\u00f1os. Roberta's has a really cool vibe that I highly recommend for dinner with friends when they come into the city and you want to show them a cool spot or even a good date choice. However, the reason they're not getting five stars is the wait is always ridiculous. Pizza shouldn't take that long to make, however I've never been quoted under an hour to two hours when I've come here ( both times with only one other person)- no matter what day of the week or time.

They have a Dinning area, patio area, and also a pick up/to go area. All which take up like a half of a block.\n\nWe came in on a gloomy Saturday afternoon. The place was fairly packed, however the Dinning room was super busy (30 min wait). The host did inform us we could go to the patio and order & pick up from the Togo space and eat in the patio. That was the best idea for a group our size, we were able to snag a bench for our big party in the patio, were they some old school hip hop playing, which always makes eating pizza in BK that much better. We didn't have to deal with a server, we were able to order our pizza, wait about 10-15 mins and then walk it back over and grub!!!\n\nThe pizza was really good. Super fresh & quality ingredients were used (you can tell by the Taste). I can tell why this place is a hot spot for good pies.\n\nWe will definitely be back.", "Roberta's takes eating pizza to a whole new level and all the hype is definitely warranted.  If you want to dine in, enter through the red door, you will likely encounter a wait, but just give them your cell number and they will text you when your table is ready.  If you prefer take-out, walk passed the red door to the left.  There is also an outdoor garden where you can grab a drink, wait for your table or eat your takeout pie.\n\nWhile the menu offers some non-pizza items, we were there for only 1 thing; the pizza.  We opted for the Famous Original and the Lamb of God.  Both were excellent; their crust is magic and amazing. While the crust had a delicate flavor it was by no means over-powered by the toppings.  It had just the right amount of elasticity and bite.  The Lamb of God was my favorite between the 2, it was topped with lamb sausage, ricotta, tomato, onions and chili. It hit all the notes and made for an amazing bite.  I want more.\n\nThey also have a nice selection of wine and beer and side note, their cold brewed iced tea is real good.\n\nGo at off times to avoid the large crowds, but don't deny yourself giving it a try.", "Creatively names pizza, high quality ingredients, eclectic and open space with a mix of private 2/4 top tables along with communal tables.

I have lived in Bushwick 4 years and the last couple years living down the street, i've gone here for lunch a couple times to avoid the crowds but otherwise this is NEVER an option. I'd rather have a finger removed than wait the treacherous 2-3 hours any evening. Also, seems like every time I return, the pricing on everything has gone up 1-2 dollars. As someone who has lived in the neighborhood a long time, it always makes me frustrated that the prices continue going up after a place gets popular. I still notice when my check goes up an additional $8 from the month prior for the same order.", "If you're in the mood to treat yourself to some of the best pizza in New York, you've come to the right place - but be ready for a wait if you're here on a late weeknight or during the weekend.

Our dining experience was superior to the last one although when we first arrived without a reservation on a cold week night they said they were full. We must have looked a little sad because upon a 2nd request  and after opting not to sit at the large bar table, they said they could accommodate us.\n\nWe started with the Hamachi Crudo which is a bit steep at\n$18.50. It comes with avocado, Thai chilies, lime, fish sauce, crispy shallots and puffed black rice. This was a solid appetizer and we licked every bit of sauce off that plate. Our main dishes of the Norwegian salmon and the Vietnamese chicken were spectacular!\n\nThe salmon is $19.50 and comes with roasted fingerling potatoes, scallions, baby kale, wild mushrooms, in a dill labne sauce. It's a large portion so very easily an entree that will fill you up. The Spice Roasted Chicken is\n$32.50 but is a very large entree that comes with Vietnamese style greens in a  toasted chili-lime dipping sauce. These 3 dishes were a plenty of food for 2 people. After finishing a bottle of wine and satiated stomachs we didn't mind the 6 block walk in the bitter east coast cold. Will definitely return next time I'm in DC.", "We tried this place based on their Gilt City tasting menu. Some of the Gilt City tend to be restaurants that are looking for customers. Chloe was a little pricier than other Gilts but we came here based on the reviews. And we came away agreeing with them! We had a five course chef's choice dinner that ended up feeling like many more courses. We started with their famous oyster with horseradish. Fantastic. Then an amouche bouche was a little fried ball of chick peas on top of a yogurt. Other meals included a roasted cod in a curry, fresh ravioli (not our favorite but better than other places), a pork tenderloin dish. Dessert was not only a chai tea panna cotta but also a cheese plate. If Chloe's aim was to get me to come back again I will definitely go it again.", "How does one begin with a gem like Chlo\u00e9. Do I speak of the excellent food first since it's a culinary review? Or do I start with the chic decor? Or how about with the chef, who we have unbeknownst to ourselves have been following since his early days at Jaleo, Proof, and Estadio? Or the eclectic staff who make you feel very welcomed every time. From its first days here at Navy Yard we have been thoroughly enjoying this place. I especially love the specials that pop up, and the attention they give my aunt every time.", "I visited Chloe with a bunch of my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday and we all really enjoyed the meal. The location is in a prime spot and within walking distance to a bunch of bars. We made a reservation ahead of time and they are able to accommodate larger parties. The restaurant is on the smaller side so I definitely recommend making a reservation to be guaranteed a seat and avoid having to wait. Every dish was delicious and the cocktails were tasty as well! We ordered a ton of dishes for our meal and split all of them between the 7 of us. The service was amazing and our waitress was super kind and informative throughout our dinner. My personal favorites were the Fresh Ricotta, Spiced Veal Hummus, Potato Gnocchi, and Spice Roasted Chicken. The other items were super tasty as well! We got the Manchego Cheesecake for dessert and that was also incredible with such a unique combination of ingredients. Highly highly recommend this restaurant if you haven't tried it already!", "We had dined at Chloe before and enjoyed ourselves, so made a reservation for outdoor dining with heater for our seven year anniversary. Upon arrival for our reservation they said there were no tables with heaters available, and acted as if we were a walk-in and we shouldn't have expected more. We were sat at an unheated table away from the main drag and left unattended in the cold with no greeting from the server for quite some time, no presentation of the menu, in short with no service while watching the 20-30 plus tables with heaters. Since I was unoccupied with food or drink I had plenty of time to observe all the attended tables, and see that a couple of tables even had two heaters. After about half an hour the host returned with a heater. We still hadn't been offered drinks by the server. When I pointed out the tables with multiple heaters, and the lack of attention, the host contradicted me rudely. That's when we chose to leave. Neither the host nor the server expressed any sympathy.\n\nGood news is that thanks to this rudeness we had a lovely anniversary dinner at Schilling Canning Company who treated us so well, even without a reservation, even as their kitchen was closing. Thanks for that silver lining, Chloe!", "I love Chloe and have enjoyed dining on their patio throughout the pandemic. My ggf & I really like the cocktails here and think this is a cute spot for a more high-end girls' night out.\n\nService has been great on all my visits and I loved the attentiveness to getting us moved and sheltered during one visit we were caught in a sudden rain storm outside while dining on the patio. You won't go wrong ordering the caramelized cauliflower appetizer or the Norwegian Salmon entree. I love gnocchi & Chloe's mushroom rendition does not disappoint. If you're looking for something more hearty, go with the generously portioned spice roasted chicken.

The cut of cucumber was generous and their garlic marinade was so good our kids would just drink it after they have finished the cucumber.  The dan dan noodle was also very good. The noodle tasted like fresh hand pulled noodles.  In fact, there's nothing here that we have tried that we didn't like.

The beef dumplings were fine but its not what I'm used to so I prefer the traditional pork.  \n\nTheir other dumplings were good but definitely the standout are their soup dumplings.  I also like the pan fried buns.

We sat on the back patio and even though it was a cold night, the heaters made it comfy and the candles made it a total vibe. Like I said, a dream.\n\nThere are like, four patios here plus a back bar and a few cozy rooms up front. You really can't fail, although I like the patios the best. The food here is great--lots of old school classics which feels right for Pasadena, but with a sort of modern spin. Prices are on the higher side ($14-16 for cocktails, for example) and worth it in my opinion. There's a parking lot onsite as well as plenty of parking on Fair Oaks (at least while we were there). Such a cute neighborhood in Pasadena as well if you're into nerding out on old craftsman homes!", "I could post up at The Raymond patio all day long! Came here for lunch and left with a lasting impression that I must come back for a movie night and happy hour!\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the area like me, you might get lost on your initial visit. But once you find the entrance to the restaurant, parking is easy breezy (at least it was for lunch on a Wednesday).\n\nService was exceptional. All of the staff was friendly and professional. I felt like I was dining at a super fancy restaurant with the quality of service they provide here.\n\nI got the Raymond Curry after hearing rave reviews for it, and it did not disappoint. I loved that it came with an assortment of toppings like peanuts, coconut shavings, raisins, and mango chutney. I also appreciated the healthy veggies on the side. The entire dish came together so well.\n\nI love the history behind this building, it makes it so much more meaningful to hang out and imagine what this place used to be like. We dined on the patio on a beautiful day and I can't wait to come back with friends!", "This is one of our favorite places to spend a leisurely evening eating way too much food and drinking way to much booze.\n\nWe've been here about a half dozen times and instead of having entrees, my husband and I usually split about 5-6 of their smaller plates tapas style, and last Saturday (7/23/2016) was no exception!  We were seated on their gorgeous outdoor patio, with Lainey was our server and she was absolutely delightful, engaging, and knowledgeable. My husband and I had a tough time selecting a wine, and she brought out a few options for us to try so that we were sure we were pleased with our ultimate choice.  The food, as always, was excellent (though our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs!), and the cocktails that came out of the 1886 bar were top notch - I cannot recommend their Smoking Jacket enough!\n\nAlways a fabulous evening at The Raymond!", "Went for brunch - started getting crowded on the patio after 12pm, but plenty of room outside before then (make a reservation if you want to sit inside).\n\nFriendly, prompt service and a variety of breakfast/lunch options. On the pricier side for brunch, but the food is excellent - husband had the Open Faced Croissant (fried chicken topped by sunny-side eggs and a Thai-type radish/cabbage slaw, maple syrup for the sweet-savory combo) and I had the Grilled Shrimp Panzanella Salad (super flavorful grilled bread and jumbo shrimp in a tossed arugula salad with olives, cherry tomatoes and capers). Both delicious and good portions.\n\nLove the atmosphere - upscale but laid-back. Will be back to try some of their other brunch items!!", "I had a darn good Ahi Sandwiches for brunch at the Raymond. The sandwich is more like a burger, with a big Tuna Steak in between two rounds shape patties.  The Ahi was ordered to grill of your choice, I ordered the medium, wished that I had ordered medium rare.  Still the fish is seasoned well with wasabi aioli and served with soy-sauce marinated cucumber, gives a nice kick, Asian touch to the sandwiches.  The sweet potato fries comes with it are really good too.  The size of the burger is huge, I couldn't finish the whole thing.  For such a high quality burger/sandwich, $16 is not expensive at all. My coworkers ordered the Raymond Burger and chicken curry, they both liked their food. Although we didn't get to sit outside because of the weather as we planned too, but it is still an enjoyable meal.  Definitely should go back there to have brunch outside on a breezy sunny day.", "We went for Father's Day brunch. We had reservations but we were seated at an outside table on a very hot day.     The restaurant itself is very pretty with beautiful craftsman furniture and Decor.    Some of the outside tables would be very nice on the cooler evening. The food itself was excellent, but it took a very long time to arrive. Since it was a Father's Day celebration we enjoyed the time just to sit and chat. But if we had had anything else to do we would've been very frustrated by the wait.   It was almost an hour between sitting down and having the food served. Two of us ordered a lamb steak and eggs special. What we got were two small lamb chops.    We wonder if they ran out of steak and had to find chops to substitute. But we never did get an explanation for the long wait.   We thought portions were kind of small too.     I'd like to try it again in case they were just having an off day, but there are so many good choices in Pasadena but I'm not sure we'll get back.", "Went there for happy hour but ended up having dinner.

When we answered no, he threw the receipts down on the table and pointed to the amounts and asked why we hadn't given more tip. I know that this is the way of the restaurant world, but I think it is a shame that a place that has terrible service actually has the nerve to get angry about a 15% tip and the nerve to confront its repeat customers about why we didn't tip more.

Just look up at the gorgeous intricate coffered ceiling pattern coupled with casual light fixtures and you'll know what I am referring to.\n\nOur server was incredibly attentive and sweet. She made a terrific recommendation for a Greek wine by the glass. Their list was extensive and the one I had was perfect-clean, good minerality...exactly what I was looking for to start off the meal. We shared the Chef's black-eyed peas and the octopus appetizer. Both were expertly prepared. The octopus was grilled to perfection, tender, yummy. Our Louvraki fish by the pound came filleted as requested and split between the two of us. It was flaky, fresh and nicely grilled. The real show stoppers here were the veggie sides-Horta greens and unbelievable roasted brussel sprouts.\n\nNext time we are hankering for some Greek specialties, terrific fish and a lovely sophisticated atmosphere we will be coming here for sure!", "We had a great experience eating at the bar.

The restaurant was packed with the preshow crowd.  \n\nOur choices were highlighted by, per Bill, the Greek \"farmer\" salad and the only disappointment of the evening was our choice of stuffed pepper.  Way over sauced with very bland tomato based sauce.  The surprise of the meal was Bill's choice of pickled beets covered in mashed potatoes.  It was delightful.\n\nLooking out over the dining room it is easy to see why there are so many 1 and 2 star reviews.  One misstep by the kitchen or waitstaff and the evening is ruined for somebody.\n\nIf you want a 4 star experience, sit at the bar and let Bill and Anastasia lead you through the wines and menu.

Molyvos is the type of restaurant that is great for a large group OR an intimate date.\n\nMolyvos has great spreads (like tzatziki and hummus) and great appetizers. I ordered my usual, the chicken burger salad with iced tea. Its a flavorful chicken patty over a greek salad served with tzatziki and pita. It doesn't sound like much but its DELICIOUS. The greek salad has oven dried tomatoes, chickpeas & feta (hell yeah) over mixed greens. The tzatziki is also the best I've ever had - you could put it on anything and it would be great. I haven't tried the desserts yet but my coworkers raved about the Baklava ice cream.

I didnt think the seafood dishes were that great, but they do add some herbs that make it stand out and taste unique. All the meat dishes were good, shout outs to the Kenefes and the meat stuffed cabbage.

Usually when you go to a Korean bbq restaurant they serve you steamed eggs and some chigae (stew), so yes, it was disappointing that the soup in the combo is your very basic soup that should've been for the price, more complex. Meat was fantastic, but would've love to have had some sliced raw garlic. Maybe they'll give it to you if you ask. Overall this restaurant seems catered toward non-Koreans. I mean, what kbbq place doesn't automatically serve \"ssam jang?\" I mainly chose this place because it's supposedly a \"charcoal-grill\" kbbq, but it's only a few charcoal pieces. Ambiance is fancier than the usual AYCE, but I'd rather go to a hole-in-the-wall with bomb banchan and smokey charcoal-grills.

We shared a few items between four of us and everything was phenomenal! We did the ahi crudo...The flavor was amazing. I am not much of a steak person but we had the Wagyu and it was literally one of the best things I have eaten. Perfect balance of flavor and seasoning and it melted in your mouth. We also had the coppa ham which was pretty delicious as well. One thing that we absolutely love is their sourdough bread. It is incredible! A must for an appetizer! And the hearth roasted carrots with humboldt fog cheese...wow! For us the Silver Hawk was the drink of the nite. It is not normally a drink I would order but it was fantastic. We also had the impala and it was just ok. We also brought a couple bottles of wine as we were celebrating an occasion and their corkage is very reasonable.

For two of us, we decided to get the goat milk cavatelli (this was my favorite!), chicken fried quail, the charred caulilini, the scallop agauchie, and the compart duroc pork belly.

The Adjaruli Khachapuri is freshly baked and was devoured in between comments like, \"Oh my God that's amazing.\" We also had the Megruli, which was savory and a bit spicy.

I would recommend the Mini over the normal ones.\n\nFor main courses, we had Lamb Mtsvadi, Fried Cornish Game Hen (Tabaka), and one of the best dishes anywhere, the Beef Chashushuli. This is a signature Georgian beef stew and must be experienced to believe. Just amazing.\n\nThe only \"problem\" I can think of is that we over-ordered, as the portions and generous and filling - though this just led to yummy doggie bags.

Kisco - and with some food diversity. Much appreciated.  First off the service even in a somewhat full restaurant was very good and attentive.  Food options are interesting.  We ordered a lamb dish, the dumplings in a yogurt sauce and a soup.  I though that the servings were a little lite in both quality and quantity.  The lamb dish had small pieces of lamb and the dumplings were very fresh and homemade but the sauce could have used more flavor.  I have eaten at similar places in Queens and part of the appeal is the style - many food options, salads and the like all on the table family style.... we will try again though", "Delicious, really and truly. I've never had Georgian food before - in fact, my only knowledge of Georgia was a former high school classmate who hailed from the country.\n\nOn a rare date night, my husband and I decided to try Badageoni before a movie. The atmosphere was relaxed with romantic lighting, with a mix of couples and families dining at nearby tables. We started with the Pkhali Rolls, which were delicious -- sweet and savory, and easy to devour. The real star of the menu, though, was the Adjaruli -- a decadent bread boat of cheeses, butter and egg, served piping hot and meant to be quickly combined to cook the egg through. It was worth every calorie. For my main, I had the Lobio and my husband had the char-grilled lamb special. The Lobio was good, a little too salty for me, but honestly after the starters, I was so full. My husband ate every last bite of his lamb, and we were planning our next visit before we even paid the bill. Highly recommend.", "In this bizarre era - you can go to a restaurant but should you? - I won't forget the spectacular service at Badageoni. They graciously set up a sidewalk table for us, complete with candlelight.\n\nThe best strategy is a mix-and-match so you can try appetizers. If you're only picking one appetizer, the pkhali is an excellent choice, a great mix of the familiar (beets, spinach and carrots) and the new (to me anyway). The beef-and-pork khinkhali is juicy, almost into soup dumpling territory.\n\nChakapuli is under signature dishes and is listed first so of course that's a great choice, featuring lamb with ingredients including tarragon. After this feast, dessert was an option, but with the top notch food and service I expect to make the two hour JC-to-Mount Kisco trek relatively soon.", "It took us a while to try this place. but OMG dinner at Badageoni Georgian Kitchen was decadent and delicious.\n\nWe ripped apart our khachapuri, covered in cheesy goodness.

The tacos are relatively small, but two of them makes up a pretty good portion. I also had a side of Frijoles Negros, which was a puree of black beans, which had a lot of good flavor. The puree base got a little overwhelming after a while though, but they do give a good amount of it.\n\nService: Order at the counter, and then the food gets served to you at your table.

My favorite pasta was the aptly named \"grandma walking through forest in emilia,\" AKA spinach-infused pasta with roasted leeks + spring peas in a black mushroom sauce.\n\nOther main favorites: the veal cheek and the sirloin steak were perfectly cooked...oh, and the cipollini (sweet & sour baby onions) complemented both of the meats beautifully. Definitely don't miss those.\n\nFor any foodie nerds out there, Chef Stefano Secchi trained in Massimo Bottura's restaurant Osteria Francescana in Modena, IT (read: genius mind). We learned that he literally makes every pasta you're eating at the restaurant by hand. The entire staff is super knowledgable as well.\n\nOverall, can't wait for my next visit. Make a res at Rezdora ASAP!", "Food was 4.5 but portions were quite small for a $20-25 pasta dish. The gnocco fritto were very good. They consisted of 3 very light and crisp savory puff pastries with cured meat on top (prosciutto, capocollo, and mortadella). The pastas we ordered were the verde on verde on verde, gnocchi Di zucca, and gramigna giallo e verde. My favorite pasta was the verde on verde on verde. It was a beautiful, very light green pasta with pesto, pine nuts, and kale. It was fresh and very visually stunning too. The gnocchi Di zucca was also very good. The squash gnocchi almost had a hint of pumpkin/cinnamon, and it was in a very buttery sauce. The gramigna was a beautiful green and wheat colored pasta sauce with a sausage ragu. We also got roasted sun chokes which were amazing! They were crisp, slightly charred, and the balsamic went perfectly with it. This place would receive 5 stars if not for the very small portion sizes. I'm used to receiving small portions at NYC restaurants, but these were appetizer size pastas. They should either serve more or price them in the $10-20 range.", "Thank you so much for the finest meal I had while visiting NYC. It wasn't an easy table to secure, but Jesse, the host, was more than accommodating, making me feel completely welcome as a solo diner.\nAs soon as I tasted the stunning Cacio e Pepe in Emilia, a twist on the pasta classic that substitutes little lettuces for noodles, I knew I was in for something special. Chef Stefano followed it with an amuse of delicate puff pastry, and them it was on to the Anolini di Parma, a meat-filled pasta in a rich parmigiano sauce.\nAt that point I was more than satisfied, and would have been happy to repair to my hotel room as a satisfied diner. But Chef Stefano had other plans. Appearing at my tableside to introduce himself, he told me he appreciated solo diners--and placed another dish on the table in front of me. A combination of two different pastas with contrasting sauces, this off-menu gem was the best part of my meal.\nLast a shoutout to my server Jesse, who was a pro, and kept the cocktails coming. Thank you, Rezdora, and see you next year!", "It's been a hard couple months, but my experience ordering takeout from Rezdora stands out as a highlight! I was lucky enough to have secured a reservation to get the in-person experience and all its glory prior to the pandemic and it was seriously amazing. The food and experience here was absolutely out of this world and I quickly knew this would be one of my favorite restaurants!\n\nWhile dining at the restaurant is no longer an option, I decided to go for their takeout option, and the food was every bit as good as it was in person. The Grandma Walking in the Forest pasta is constantly in my dreams and the veggie sides are so delectable! I have stocked up on more than enough wine, but they also offer great wine selections on their takeout menu as well!\n\nTheir menu is top notch and every dish is so unique, Italian dishes that you can't get anywhere else. The service is quick and ordering via Caviar is super easy! If you're in the mood to treat yourself to a quarantine meal, definitely choose Rezdora!", "Rezd\u00f4ra was a huge disappointment. I was super excited because I love Italian food & was intrigued since the chef had worked with so many critically acclaimed chefs. Sadly, we only liked one menu item here out of the three that we ordered.\n\nWhat we ate:\n1. Gnocco Fritto: This dish was so inelegant. Basically a huge puffed up balloon with a large hunk of meat thrown on top. There's really no correlation between the two. Would have been much better in a slightly smaller size with the center of the top cut out & some marscapone or some tertiary flavor inside with the meat then artfully arranged on top.\n\n2. \"Grandma walking through forest in Emilia\" : the only dish we liked. I really loved this dish. It was flavorful with a hint of mushrooms. Nothing was off balanced. Basically, packets of joy!\n\n3. Spinach Pappardelle with Rabbit Ragu : We honestly could not get over the fact that this dish looked like pasta with a can of cat food mushed into it...\n\nAll in all, I wish we had liked this restaurant, but these dishes need help if you're going to charge a lot of money for pasta (which I can essentially make in my apartment for a fraction of the price. And yes, make it look & taste better)", "The place itself seems very nice, and the staff is polite and friendly, well trained, however, the serving size of the dishes is rather embarrassing. I almost laughed when my waiter brought the pasta dish, super tiny, not your regular pasta size in regards of the location/pricing/etc. If it were bigger (or normal sizing) it would be a different review, all things considered...I doubt I will be back.\nP.S. And \"anolini di parma\" aka ravioli served with no sauce, no nothing, just plain? hm.

Loved the food. Liked the ambiance.\n\nNext to the market, which deserves a walkthrough and maybe a purchase, this is a very good farm-to-table, Mediterranean-influenced small restaurant.\n\nI really liked how the open kitchen with bar seating grabs the eyes of diners in the main dining room. Lighting is pretty simple, but enhanced with the floor-to-ceiling windows along the sidewalk wall.\n\nMy friend and I opted for the 3-course tasting menu, that is very modestly priced at $39. We each had an incredibly fresh mixed salad - generous portion too - with an amazing vinaigrette dressing that had a nice, more subtle than not, spicy punch to it. We then had the salmon which was absolutely fabulous. Well cooked, nice portions, over a delicious quinoa and kale vegetable mixture. I could have eaten it all night long. Dessert was a rhubarb torte and a chocolate cake, each served with a small dab of incredibly good ice cream.\n\nWine list, by the glass or bottle, was very good and moderately priced.\n\nOverall, I'd return to Foragers Table. Enjoy!", "OMG! One of the best restaurants in NYC. They are amazing! I've visited them last Monday and for sure I'll be back. When I'm doing a review I'm looking for good food( ), good service() and reasonable prices (). Let's start with the food. I had the Pan Roasted Duck.. yummy yummy yummy! Amazing!! The duck was so tender and juicy. My brothers had the roasted chicken and the salmon! Oh my god! I tried some of their food and it was DELICIOUS! So as you can see I loved their food! Our servers were amazing as well! Maria (I think, I'm not sure)  recommended me to try the threes (pale ale) great combination with the duck. Also she mentioned that she was a new member of their team and that shows, that you guys take pride of who you have serving your customers if somebody who's training over there is so \"experienced\"! Usually they are looking for their captains, doing nothing but staring on a corner. NO HERE! Also prices where preety reasonable for what you get. Great food, great staff! You cant get that for free!", "Had a lovely brunch here over the weekend. Foragers Table is set in the back of a cute market, that offers a bunch of local, sustainable, and artisanal products - from produce and fruits, to fresh meat from their butcher counter, and pastries.\n\nThe setting is welcoming, with an airy dining area, open kitchen, and high counter top sitting available along with seated tables.\n\nFor food, I opted to go with the Merguez Sausage and a side of chicken sausage. Other dishes our party ordered, included the pancakes (absolutely amazing - light and slightly tangy, but also sweet enough to satisfy my endless sugar cravings), farmhouse shakshuka (looked great but didn't try any), and the pistachio cardamom bread (delicious with the mixed berry marmalade). As for the Merguez, it had a nice touch of spice to it, the stew was tasty, and the rosemary potatoes added some heartiness to it.\n\nPrices were a little high in my opinion, with all but one of the brunch entrees being $18-20, and the side menu items (including scones being pricey as well). Hard to justify paying those amounts for brunch/breakfast, even though it was all delicious. Service was friendly.", "We came here for dinner before going to Gotham comedy club that is a couple of blocks away.  We started with the beef sopas (4/5) which oddly didn't come out until after we got our entrees. It was nicely presented and the rich flavor was well complemented  by the avo and garnishing.  For mains, we had the roast chicken (3/5) which was a bit on the dry side and nothing special.  However, the duck breast (5/5) was very good and the duck was very fresh and cooked perfectly med-rare. The chutney and curry spring onion was just enough for the duck. i also really enjoyed the fonio pilaf.  No idea what is in it. It is just good without being heavy. For dessert, we had the purple carrot cake (2/5) which failed for being very purple or tasting much like a carrot cake or any kind of tasty cake.  This is prob a 3.5 stars overall but for the duck I would notch up to 4.", "I stopped in her for lunch with a fairly large group and was just delighted. We spent some time poking around the delightful market at the front of the restaurant and then were seated and served promptly.\n\nThe restaurant and market utilize several local farms, including one they own themselves. The produce and meat were so fresh, every bite of our entree's pooped with flavor. A special treat for us was when one of the managers, Craig, came by and was nice enough to tell us about the restaurant and the organization that keeps the whole thing going. It is fascinating.\n\nAt a time when most people seem to talk more about sustainability than do anything about it, Forager's is really living up to its claims.\n\nI had the Cod sandwich which was great, and the lamb hash was also delicious. I don't know how pertinent recommendations are as I get the sense the restaurant changes its menu quite frequently in order to utilize whatever is in season and available.\n\nAlso, give the wine on tap a try. I was skeptical at first but became a quick convert. Great place!", "This place is amazing. Highly recommend if you're looking to go beyond the traditional eggs benedict, omelettes and pancake sort of brunch. Their dishes are different, flavorful and so unique. They use farm fresh ingredients from local farms in the area and you can tell the freshness from the veggies and the meat.

Not too many places serve cochinita pibil, so that's another reason why I have to get it. I'll admit it doesn't look very good to the eye, but its taste always makes up for that in my opinion. It's a spicy stewed pork with pickled red onions on top. It's pretty spicy, so make sure you get one of their agua frescas to cool your mouth off.\n\nMy go-to drink their is their melon agua fresca! It's so good. It's an orange cantaloupe drink with real fruit pulp in it.

But you get that everywhere.\nA dosa can be made crispy or soft, depending on how you want it. It's like how you want your toast. I saw someone complaining about how the dosa was too crispy and I lost my shit.", "This is an Indian place that specializes in south Indian cuisine.  This means their dosas (rice flour crepe; masala dosa is one with potatoes inside) vadas (fried lentil donut), their sambar dipping sauce are all very good.  A full display of other south Indian style vegetarian dishes can be found at their weekend lunch buffets.  Their curries (the goat curry is excellent), and kormas are also very good.\n\nBeing of south Indian heritage, I was happy to find this place.  Having said all this, their north Indian menu items, the items that people recognize due to the prominence of north Indian restaurants in LA (or the US for that matter) are not their specialty.  I generally stay away from the aloo palak, chicken tikka masala, etc...  However, you can't go wrong with naan and samosas.\n\nMy girlfriend (German/Italian heritage) and I are regulars here, and we've figured out that as long as you stick with the south Indian dishes (80%) of the menu, you'll have an extraordinary meal in this family owned and run place.", "If you are in the mood for some yummy Kerala fish (South Indian, Tumeric based curry), then this is the place for you! I have been here for dinner and let me tell you its not the same as coming here for the weekend lunch buffet.\n\nThe buffet has a lot of variety: Fish with appams (think soft Indian style pancakes made with rice flour, utterly delicious), roasted chicken, mutton stew, 2-3 vegetables, rice, naan, lentils, sambar, rasam (south Indian style spicy clear soup) and so much more. I always end up eating just the fish curry with appams and believe me you can never have too much of this dish.\n\nThey keep getting the naans and appams fresh from the kitchen. Service is very friendly. The owner always makes time to stop by and ask you if you like the food etc. She's super nice and friendly.\n\nFYI, this used to be a Pakistani restaurant before the new owners (from Kerala) bought it (and was pretty nasty), so don't go here thinking you will Halal food or biryani...This is much better than all that. Go here for the fish and thank me later! Cant recommend it enough.", "I was looking forward ti coming here after reading about it on Yelp. I have always loved dosas and they are hard to find. So I didn't have lunch to save room for a huge dinner. I wanted to try many things on the menu and took a hungry friend to eat family style.\n\nThe setting is another strip mall hole-in-the-wall. But the inside is big and has booths to sink into. The service was nice enough. I didn't like the chai or dal. Both were flavorless. The main dishes were average. But, mmmmmmm the dosas were wonderful. Next time I'll just go and get those with a cold beer.\n\nButtery thin dosas that melt in your mouth + sexy date  = hot for love later", "The food here is amazing. Really good Kerala style cuisine. Came for the lunch buffet and everything was really good and authentic. Service is quick. The gobi Manchurian, fish curry, sambar and rasam were really good. The fresh appams were the highlight.

The spicy salsa has a good kick, but will not overwhelm you. The pico/salsa is light and fresh. The guac is solid, but then again, it's hard to mess up guac right?\n\nWhen eating the taco, it was missing an acid, to help cut through the salt.

You can order by the pound, half pound, or they have lunch specials. It's fun because it's basically a \"make your own taco\" at the table with cilantro, onion, beans, etc. They also have some fried tacos (look similar to empanadas), and you can order those a la carte or with the lunch special.\n\nNice service!

Also, when I dined last evening for a first date we wanted to share a bone in steak and my date wanted it basically still moving and I wanted medium rare.

This place they have the bar around the pizza oven so I loved seeing the people making the pizza and putting it into the oven and coming back out.\n\nWe ended up ordering the sausage pizza (crushed tomato, mozzarella, red onion, chili). This one was so good. We also got the margherita (crushed tomato, mozzarella, basil) as well because we needed to know how it would be. Enjoyed the sausage pizza more, but the margherita is a good vegetarian one.\n\nWe also ordered the chocolate pot de creme. It came with whipped cream and a bit of sea salt on top. It was just slightly too much salt but good!\n\nProtip: sausage pizza!", "Made reservations Saturday midday for a 9:30 same-day late dinner with a group of 4, at the recommendation of some friends.\n\nFOOD: we shared the cauliflower app, which was delicious and not a starter you'd expect at a pizza place, even a \"nicer\" one. In fact, all their starters were pretty unique and tasty-sounding and out-of-the-norm.\n\nPizzas are personal-sized and cut into quarters. . I got the salami one, toppings were really flavorful, if a bit thin. Ratio of toppings to crust could've been higher, or at least they could've been spread closer to the edge.. Crust was soft, chewy, thin, blistered by their blazing wood-fired oven around the perimeter - all good things, but 1.5\" crust around a 12\" pizza is a lot of crust!\n\nEnded on some scoops of McConnell's ice cream, which obviously isn't made in house, but reinforces the whole New-American-place-that-happens-to-only-serve-pizza-entr\u00e9es-that-should-be-eaten-with-knife-and-fork vibe.\n\nSERVICE:\nWe were served promptly and our food came quickly because of our late reservation. Their pizza oven is right out in the open, and made for a cozy environment coupled with the dim lighting.\n\nOVERALL:\nGreat pizza in a great setting. Now I just need to get over my \"it's just pizza so it shouldn't be so expensive\" prejudice to come here more often...", "what i loved most about del popolo is the super duper friendly service. fast and attentive, and so friendly! we arrived at 8 pm on wednesday with a reservation and were seated immediately in an intimate window spot. fun pillows too! plus points.\n\nwe ordered - squid appetizer, the winter squash and house made sausage pizzas.  pizzas came out really fast, and man they looked great!  awesome char on the crust and theyre pretty generous with toppings. however...i wasnt as impressed with the taste.. i found both pies to be slightly bland. the crust was great and chewy around the edges though.. beers are half-pint, and thus overpriced.  dinner for 3 was over 100 bucks, which i found to be a bit crazy since it was pizza..\n\ni'd probably give them another shot a while down the line..", "Del Popolo makes excellent Neopolitan style pizza, comparable in quality and style to Tony's in North Beach and Una Pizza Napoletana in SOMA. The crust is nice and chewy and slightly sour - tasting slightly fermented. The sauce and toppings are excellent.\n\nWe weren't able to get reservations at a reasonable time on Sunday (the earliest reservation for 2 was at 9:30pm) so we decided to walk in just before 6pm, and were promptly seated at the large communal tables in the center of the restaurant. The place was completely full by 6:30pm, so go early if you don't have reservations.\n\nWe started off with the sauteed Monterrey Bay squid, which was excellent. The squid was lightly battered and was served atop cranberry beans (similar to pinto/Canelli beans) with a tangy ripe tomato.\n\nI had the housemade sausage pizza, which was excellent. The pizza was topped with a generous amount of Italian/Fennel sausage, which complimented the tangy crushed tomatoes and mozzarella cheese perfectly.\n\nOverall, we had an excellent experience at Del Popolo and would definitely want to visit again.", "Do you love chubby babies and bouncy mochi? Well if you do, then you will LOVE the crust at Del Popolo, because biting into their dough will make you feel like youve sunk your teeth into some yummy baby soft mochi flesh. Ok yes that sounds super creepy, but just think about how much you love those things! A friend gave me that description once and I don't think there's a more precise one out there.\n\nAnyway the pizza is amazing if you're into traditional Napoletana style pizza. The texture of the dough requires a crazy hot oven/ super fast cook times. If you like a crispy sort of cracker crust, go elsewhere and save me from having to wait behind you in line!\n\nI like their traditional margherita the best--the tart but balanced tomato sauce is magical with their mozzarella. I confess I'm a heathen and sometimes ask for extra mozzarella, which def throws things off balance ...but the extra cheese saves me from having to fight my SO for the precious chunks.\n\nIf you don't want to go downtown to their brick and mortar shop, they were first famous for their gigantic food truck, which is often at Off The Grid events, concerts, etc.", "I recently discovered Del Popolo sells make your own margarita pizza kits which I would highly recommend! The kit comes with dough, olive oil, sauce, cheese, and basil and the process is extremely simple. Not quite as good as when I dined in here, but that's to be expected and is a fun activity to do especially during this quarantine. I've never seen a restaurant sell a full kit (only the dough) which is so much better since the ingredients are such high quality. I'll definitely be back!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-popolo-san-francisco-3?hrid=P-7ZKV5zNvT2R94u-5E8Vw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-popolo-san-francisco-3?hrid=sHpQPTyXXI58e4mluoGTEQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-popolo-san-francisco-3?hrid=gEOvb-o15qbrinZxQXdVtw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-popolo-san-francisco-3?hrid=0okUDm9WSDp2dJpD-fOcNQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-popolo-san-francisco-3?hrid=vgCq6aOMSrh1Kizg_6mfTQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-popolo-san-francisco-3?hrid=mT-3ZBKSvWI0rJvHqfckDQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Tied House", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/tied-house-chicago/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/tied-house", "michelin_pov": "It might come as a surprise that this sleek, good-looker shares the same owners as next-door Schubas Tavern.

Not one but two sections of the menu are devoted to bread\u2014the first offering spreads like chicken liver mousse, the second a cheeseburger, a collard green melt and a panko chicken sandwich.\nOf course, this kitchen can do so much more and flexes its culinary muscles in other dishes, like fried sweet potato with salsa macha and cumin yogurt or a winning Spanish mackerel set on coconut-braised garbanzo beans and garnished with fistfuls of parsley and mint. However spacious the dining room might be, the long, marble-top bar is the focal point of the room.", "yelp_reviews": ["This is a beautifully designed restaurant with a great ambiance, but we were disappointed in the food. A sweet potato starter consisted of two charred pieces of sweet potato served with flavorless pickled (or just cold) small turnips. Portions were tiny and our second courses, the monkfish and the mackerel, were overcooked and lacking in flavor. The mackerel serving was the size of an index finger, and it was accompanied by two very small charred baby leeks. The monkfish was three very small, overcooked nuggets of fish (stringy, not silky as expected), served on a bed of bland porridge, with two or three tiny pearl-sized pieces of apple and ribbons of raw kohlrabi, the latter a bizarre and not in any way taste-enhancing addition. Elements described on the menu about some of the dishes we ordered were missing. Although the restaurant was not full when we were there, service was uneven--our bottle of wine, albeit reasonably priced and very good, was not served until we were halfway through our first courses. I will say that the Parker House rolls were very good, but the chicken liver mousse tasted as if it had been in the refrigerator for awhile.", "I wasn't expecting much coming from Schubas but was hoping for a foodie addition to my neighborhood.\n\nThe design is interesting. I like the modern feel but it has flair of old school. The entrance is stunning. The logo is very cool.  The outside fireplace rip off of Elske is glaring and puts me off from the start.\n\nThe cocktails are all vermouth based and on paper, not super appealing to me. I had One, it was ok, too sweet. Lots of wine and craft beer but nothing I would order.\n\nThe menu breakdown is fun, I like how they sound. However, the portion and execution are lacking at this price point.  I like the smears concept, but the best bread is what they buy from Publican, house made rolls are lacking in flavor and the texture is too chewy.\n\nThe maitake mushroom was a huge let down. The broth was decent but the mushroom wasn't seasoned and just tasted watery.\n\nMackerel was an interesting concept but just kind of boring. When the best part is the leek there is an issue with the dish.\n\nCool looking place so I'm sure it will stay busy. However, this won't be a spot foodies will come to again. I won't be back.", "We went to Tied House for dinner last week.  I have to say that it was by far the most impressive dining experience I have had in a long time. First, the design is impressive. Beautiful pieces of marble, and eye-catching architectural elements. We started with the bread. Amazing!\nWe ordered several dishes as recommended by our server. The celery dish is delicious.  Go for the \"add-on truffle.\"  We had the polenta, and they surprised us with tableside service in the middle of the dining room. The manager explained it was a way to unveil how the cooks were preparing dishes. I don't think I will ever forget this experience. We had the cocktail number 15.  I haven't thought of ordering a cocktail with fermented garlic as a component, but our server made the recommendation. It was delicious! The cocktail is garnish with grated cheese, brilliant! The wine program is well-developed offering a large variety of international wines from small producers.\nThis place has a lot to offer. I will return very soon.", "Lots of reviews talk about the small serves. They are not what I would call 'American sized', but they aren't small. The restaurant suggests a small and a large plate each, and if you also share the bread (it's delicious!) or a dessert (also delicious!) I would say they've got the serving size spot on. This isn't the place for you if you're expecting a mountain of pasta or chips or garlic bread - you'll be disappointed. But, if you like innovative ingredients, cooked and presented excellently then you'll enjoy your meal here.\nI shared a meal with friends, and of the ten or so plates we ordered to share, nine were 'plate-clearingly' excellent and one was just okay. In another restaurant I would have said it was good, but the bar had been set so much higher by all the other wonderful dishes.\nThe atmosphere is lovely, and the service is friendly and knowledgeable. The drinks are on the expensive side, but for the most part well made. We had some discussion about what should go in an off menu classic cocktail, but perhaps that is just a regional difference. What arrived wasn't what was expected, but did taste very nice.", "I live 2 doors down from this place and was stoked for them to open. Their opening weekend, my partner and I were ecstatic to have such a great spot so close to us. By the end of the evening we were simply shocked by the lack of service, inflated prices, and tiny portions. We waited a few months and tried them again separately a few times. The food is okay and they have definitely upped their portions. I've dined at the bar alone with a book twice now. (Also when is that beautiful patio of theirs EVER open?) The first time, my service was phenomenal but the food was sub-par. The second time I felt like a complete inconvenience to the bar server and my food was again sub-par.

As park tavern can cater to a more dressy and touristy crowd, I think the cavalier will be my go to burger joint! The fish and chips also looked great. The Brussel sprout chips are also a must have!!

The menu is a roll-call of everyone\u2019s favorites, from chicken paillard to beet salad, burgers to cheesecake. Cocktails are well made and beers carefully poured. Dishes are executed with sufficient care and portions are of manageable proportions.\nThe room comes with an appealing art deco feel and the terrace at the front pulls in the occasional passerby. Service is personable and willing too, although after all this time the place could probably run itself.", "yelp_reviews": ["This is a great spot in TriBeCa.  Very loud, but that's part of the appeal.  The food was spot on.  Wife and I split the miso glazed Salmon which was new to the menu and absolutely perfect.  Daughter got the orrichette pasta which was also excellent.\n\nThe mixed green salad was divine in its simplicity, the mixed beet and aged goat cheese salad also top notch.\n \nService was great.  We told the waiter to take his time, which he did, and the pacing of the meal was perfect for us.  All too often the entree arrives moments after the salad is cleared but that wasn't the case here.  We wanted to enjoy ourselves in a relaxed manner and that's what we got.  It' s nice when they listen to diner's requests.\n\nIf you are drinking, try the Aperol Sour.  A true European classic.  Our only reason for downgrading this restaurant is from the wine service.  We ordered a $100 bottle of Amarone, our favorite kind of wine, and it was served at room temperature.  Sorry folks, there's a price point, and in my mind it's way below $100, where you start keeping your wine at the proper storage and serving temp.\n\nOther than that, a great experience and will definitely return.", "There is something charming and glamorous about this familiar old-worldly place that makes you feel like you stepped back into a wonderful time in New York City.  I was prompted to visit this place after reading about it in NY Mag, and hearing the who's whos of NY called this TriBeCa brasserie their regular spot, artists, actors... It's easy to see why when you walk in.  Apparently they were the pioneers of this area, you get a sense of that today. Perfect amber lighting, attention to detail on every table and you never have to summon a waiter, the staff is so attentive almost mind reader-like.  Celebrity sighting seems to be a regular thing here.\nOk, so food:\nDELICIOUS! Everything we ordered was spot on:\n*GRILLED OCTOPUS\n*CROQUE MONSIEUR (theirs is arguably the best in New York, it's like a French style grilled cheese only b\netter!!)\n*CAVATELLI PASTA WITH TRUFFLE OIL, ASSORTED WILD MUSHROOMS & RICOTTA PARMESAN CHEESE.  Jesus Christ, I was licking the bowl.\n*CHOCOLATE PUDDING\n*PROFITEROLE (can I just say I haven't had one this good since Italy.... The top and bottom pastry were fresh and the ice cream was stellar!!)\nOur waiter was the man.  The Pinot was delicious, and my hennys kept coming.  Love this place!", "The Odeon has been around just as long as I have, and has been serving really good food for 40 years. Apparently it's where a lot of famous people used to hang out in the 80s including the cast of Saturday night live, Madonna and the like.\n\nI've only gone there recently but was really impressed with the decor, the food,  service and the outdoor seating.\n\nI have tried the salmon and the banana trifle dessert the first time I was there and both were satisfying, tasty and well proportioned.\n\nThis time around we went for the classic burger was definitely shareable. It came with fries that were perfectly crisp and not greasy at all. I also tried the burratta salad with the beets. The beets were perfectly pickled and they were the lighter colored type. Burrata was good even if a little small.\n\nI also had the purple  rice bowl and it was a great vegetarian dish with a lot of flavor and a lot of different veggie elements in it, even for a non -vegetarian. It was in a spicy Sriracha broth and included a poached egg on top which completed the dish by bringing it all together.", "Great all-American spot to go for brunch, lunch or dinner.  They have consistently friendly, attentive and knowledgeable service, and the food never disappoints - whether you go for fresh raw oysters, the french onion soup, the omelette, the tartare, the burger... and so on.  The only thing I've ever NOT liked is the chicken paillard salad, which was boring in both presentation and flavor.  \n\nAlso fun to sit and drink at the bar and grab a snack - the place is always reasonably crowded, and I've only seen it really be overwhelming on Sat/Sunday brunches.  Usually the addition of strollers is the worst possible thing about the vibe there, but hey, it's Tribeca, and I've learned to suck it up and deal with the screaming babies and strollers running over my feet at brunch time.  \n\nThe cucumber martini and ginger martini are both fresh, delicious and strong - I highly recommend!  Both are among my favorite go-to cocktails in the city, and I love how you can really taste how fresh the cucumber juice and ginger essence are.", "What a beautiful French Brasserie!\n\nGorgeous old school, classy, elegant and clean.

We were lucky to score a table for 4 in the back.  Of course, we wanted to start off with sake, which paired nicely with some of our dishes.\n\nWe had a delicious 12 courses (including a few freebies that we appreciated.

I remember the superb quality, meticulous presentation, and creative flavors that were served.  \n\nI really enjoyed the fresh nigiris plates, esp. toro, the playful egg, and the tender duck.  I already have a few lucky folks that I want to return here with.  We even got a photo with the chef and owner!", "Finding a reasonably priced omakase meal in the Bay Area is a challenge.  An 8 course meal for $65.00 in this region is a bargain, so I made a reservation a week ahead of time.\n\nWalking into the quaint space, the first thing I noticed was the cassette boom box on the counter.  I thought that was their (ancient) sound system, until I looked around and saw a few more of them throughout the dining room, along with some classic LPs along the walls.  The designers of this space seem playful and don't themselves too seriously.\n\nDinner started with an amuse bouche (not on the menu), followed by the 8 courses.  Highlights include:  Course 2, salmon on a Himalayan salt block paired with a couple of slices of Miyazaki beef, Course 5:  smoked baby corn served with a fried quail egg, and a small bowl of toro over sushi rice, seasoned with gelatinous soy sauce (part of Course 7).  \n\nMuch of my enjoyment with omakase is the fact that I would not have ordered many of these courses a la carte, but we thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal.  We were pleased with each course and felt full at the end of the evening, but not uncomfortable.  I look forward to dining here again, to try new courses on their menu.", "High quality omakase at its finest.  Each of the eight courses were beautifully presented, and timed just right so you were never waiting too long, but had enough time to have a conversation.  The quality of the fish was excellent, and even the simple dishes like the palette cleanser yuzu juice was superb.\n\nThere was a mix of classics like fresh nigiri, but also some interesting dishes like the cabbage roll which came in a creamy miso sauce.  The photos do more justice than these words.  \n\nThe part that was missing that would have made it five star is that the bar was much lower than the chef station, and it was hard to actually see what the sushi chef was making, which in my opinion is half the fun of sitting at the bar at an omakase.  Similarly, it would have been nice if the chef spoke conversed with us during the dinner, either explaining the dishes or what she was doing, or even just talked about being a sushi chef, which I also think is part of the fun of sitting at an Omakase bar.  \n\nOverall, nice Omakase experience with good food.  You won't leave here with a full stomach, but the food is good.", "So I ain't gonna lie I was a little shmizz, I was a little drizz before I went to Delage. Lol (young m.a. Song Reference) Anywhoooo I made a Saturday night reservation a few weeks prior. We got there a little early but was seated within 5 minutes. It's a 8 course omakase menu so there's nothing you can really order a la carte. If you really liked an item I suppose you can ask for seconds but I didn't try it. Based on the photos of other diners it looks like the omakase menu hasn't really changed since opening. Overall I would say the food was good. The only complaint I really had was the chilled soup. Maybe I'm just not a fan of chilled soup in general but it was not very enjoyable. Service was good. The staff is very friendly including the chefs. Chef Chikara and chef Sasaki are great! Hmm I will agree with some of the other complaints I've read about the pacing of the food. The first 3 courses came out in about 15 minutes then after that it took about 15-20 minutes each for the remaining courses. That is definitely an area they need to improve on. All in all it was an enjoyable dinner and I'll go back again. Ooooouuuu. See photos for the menu and food!", "Delage offers an amazing omakase experience at a good price. We came here for my husband's birthday in May, as he LOVES Japanese food and has been wanting to do omakase for awhile.\n\nMenu (changes regularly):\n- First: Fermented red cabbage salad with soy sesame dressing\n- Second: Two pieces chef choice's sashimi\n- Third: Chef's selection of four pieces\n- Add on: Duck Egg Chawanmushi\n- Fourth: Farmer's pickled beets and vegetable wasabi shiso puree\n- Fifth: Seared liberty duck w/ carrot puree and balsamic soy\n- Sixth: Chef's selection\n- Seventh: Organic tofu miso soup\n- Eight: Ichigo ice cream\n\nEach dish, from the amuse bouche to the dessert, was beautifully and thoughtfully presented, not to mention downright delicious. The dishes itself are small (common with omakase) but we felt satisfied at the end of the meal.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS:\n- chef's selection: fish was delicious. This included tuna, which husband normally does not like. TBH I was eyeing his tuna, hoping he'd give it to me, but he ended up eating it and loving it.\n- duck: perfectly seared and well seasoned. The carrot puree was addictive.\n\nService was attentive, chef was friendly and informative but not overly so. Definitely have this place bookmarked for special occasions in the future!", "My roommate, Andrew took me here for my birthday and it was a great meal! It was his first omakase so it's definitely fitting for a intro to omakase since it included starters, nigiri, and dessert.

I have tried their potato salad, but just a little too much going on with it.\n\nYou can do parker rolls or cornbread for one of your sides.\n\nI highly recommend the Banana Pudding with the fresh bananas and vanilla wafers for desert, OMG..it is super delicious and super satisfying...sort of...leaves you wanting more...lol", "good quality bbq. tender brisket and juicy chicken.  by no means the best I've had but nothing to complain about.\n\natmosphere is not bad.  kind of a cleaner and trendier look than what you might expect from a bbq joint.  we're in north bay after all!\n\nthe staff is friendly and service was pleasant for the most part. my only complaint--and this stands in sharp contrast--is some major confusion at the register. we felt pretty stupid waiting at the register for 5-10 minutes in a virtually empty restaurant, not knowing who was supposed to take our order.  finally, the bartender comes to help us, but in the most half assed way possible. after he took $40 from me, it took another 5 minutes to get our change (again, we were the only ones in line). I was amazed at his disregard as he left us waiting by the register while chatting casually with some other patrons. the rest of the staff noticed this, and they compensated by being extra pleasant to us while delivering our food, so it saved our service experience from being as frustrating as it started out.", "Stopped in while waiting for my car to be serviced across the street. It was the Smokey bbq smell that got me because prior to that I was planning to just grab a coffee and hold out for lunch.\n\nThe place is small, and you order at the counter before sitting. There's a bar, 4-5 seats, but my guess is this place does a lot of take out business.\n\nThe prices were fine, it's Marin after all, though for $23 I did expect a second piece of brisket with my \"combo\" meal. I certainly would have preferred that to my choice of 3 aides which seems like overkill.\n\nThe meat was good though, especially the brisket. It was cooked to perfection. The chicken fell off the bone and was perfectly moist and not overcooked. The sides were alright, nothing special to be honest.\n\nI'd stop in again but wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Still, 4 stars for the meat.", "To say I'm excited about this restaurant is not saying enough! The food is awesome! All of the meat is smoked with California white oak and hormone and antibiotic free and humanely raised and locally sourced when possible. I literally like everything on the menu...everything. To top it off the owner and chef is extremely humble and a very nice guy! You may see him waiting on you and checking on everyone. I can't wait to have an event for them to cater. Yes! They cater too!!! Oh side note the music they play is super relaxing! and the staff is extremely accommodating. You pay for your food up front and then choose it for here or to go but customer service is never missed. You are always checked on.

We sipped on our drinks while perusing the menu.\n\nIron Gate has a mix of Italian and Mediterranean dishes. We both ordered a round of cocktails to start. My husband ordered From Guyana with Love made with an aged rum. I ordered Just for Spritz, which was a grapefruit based cocktail- light and perfect for a warm evening.

The stand outs included focaccia baked in house, fresh pasta, halloumi, a chicken dish, and donuts. We also ordered a bottle of Greek wine.\n\nOverall service as well as our server was fantastic.

There was a sesame crusted feta with honey, chicken and potatoes, short rib pappardelle, and some amazing desserts. Every single item was as gorgeous on the plate as it was on the palate. Our server was incredible and made great wine recommendations. We sat for about 4 hours, eating and laughing and the server was impeccable. He was patient, attentive, and relaxed. The food was presented at a perfect pace, the wine was awesome, the cocktails interesting.

I absolutely adored Iron Gate and will return many times.", "I had been waiting to try Iron Gate for some time now.  I've heard nothing but good things, thus my expectations were pretty high.  Ended up being one of the best meals I've had in the city.  My date and I did the 6 course menu and we ordered drinks a la carte.  The Nicolaki cocktail was amazing.  I'm not even sure how many dishes really came to our table, at least 20-25.  It was a blast trying everything.  Great use of local/season ingredients.  I was fore-warned that most of the wait staff was new, but they did a great job and just need to build up some confidence.  \nAs someone that works in the industry I was very happy with my experience and I'll be back.", "I've walked past this place a hundred times and was excited when my husband announced it as our date night destination. When he called for reservations, they let him know they were booked (Friday night) but encouraged us to try walking-in.\nWe arrived around 7:30pm and were informed there was a wait. We spotted several open seats at the 1st bar area and since we were starving, decided to order from there. Service was still really good - our bartender/waiter checked on us often. It did get crowded 30-45 mins later, so I would suggest moving to a table if you're ordering food during a busy time to avoid people reaching over you or having to overhear their conversations.\nThe food and beer we ordered were all really good. The only dish you really need to know though is the caramelized ricotta gnocchi. It was beyond delicious - great sauce, well-seasoned pork sausage and I love how they slightly charred the gnocchi. We had several orders and this was by far our favorite.\nOverall, it was a great experience and I look forward to going back, sitting at a table next time, so I can really enjoy the ambiance.", "Finally made my way to Iron Gate for restaurant week! I've been attempting to go for a while but it kept falling through...\nFirst and foremost, this place is  AWESOME! When you first walk in it's a long bar with a very high ceiling and it doesn't seem like it can seat anyone. Then you walk through to the back patio where they have outdoor seating with heaters and fire pits. You think \"oh this is pretty nice, what a fun little surprise.\" But THEN they lead you across the patio to the adjacent building which has huge comfy chairs, a roaring wood-burning fireplace and an overall speakeasy feel. I had friends from out of town visiting so I'm extremely happy I chose this spot.\nOn to the food! In short- everything was delicious! Thoroughly enjoyed the Spiced Lamb Keftedes as my appetizer. The lamb was cooked very well (not too dry which happens sometimes with lamb) and it was pretty hearty for an app. The short ribs were incredible. The fat was rendered down and full of flavor. The dish also had some sweet carrots mixed in, which added a cool dynamic. The dessert was a fun twist and unlike anything I've  had before. Overall this place is great and I cannot wait to go back!", "Iron Gate has a longer history than all but a few DC restaurants. It has always been a lovely place with a cozy indoor area with a fireplace and a beautiful outside dining room under a grape arbor. Before it closed briefly in the early 2010s, however, the food was pretty bad and the service indifferent. The place is still just as pretty and now the food is more than adequate. Not spectacular--zucchini blossoms were overly greasy--but the good outweighed the bad. Gnocchi, for example, had an almost perfect consistency and came with a decidedly tasty well spiced tomato-based sauce. Is it spectacular? Nope. There are better meals.

The food wasn't bad, but didn't quite measure up to truly great Italian restaurants I've been to on the East Cost.  \n\nPerhaps some of the reason I wasn't too into it was that I'm partial to classic pasta-centric places, and Lavagna's specialties seem to be its \"second\" dishes--fish and meat.  I had the rack of lamb, which my server told me is the best entree they have.  It was OK--it's hard to screw up such a good meat--but not nearly as good as the one at say Evvia in Palo Alto or even the ones that we make at home that we buy from Costco for dirt cheap.  \n\nI also had one of the specials, a basil, arugula, and bean salad.  Again, it was all right, but nothing too incredible.  \n\nThe best part of the meal was the apple tart with ice cream dessert, which was great.  \n\nAll in all, not a bad meal, but you expect more from a 4-star Yelp rated Italian restaurant in New York.", "Lavanga was delicious! A small little authentic Italian gem in the heart of the East Village. I came here with a group of 4 on a Saturday night sans reservation and somehow by the grace of god we got seated right away. It was packed in there but still the service was pretty quick considering how fresh the food tasted. I stuck with the Fedelini Fini, a simple spaghetti with tomato sauce, and isn't that just the mark of a great restaurant? When you can order something so simple and it still blows your taste buds away. It was superb. I also tried my boyfriends Pappardelle with braised rabbit, and on the OTHER end of the simple spectrum, this complicated dish of paper thin papperdelle noodles and soft-as-butter braised rabbit was so phenomenal it had me taking 3,4,5 bites just to \"make sure I really liked it\". The wine menu is also great and our waiter was more than happy to help us make a selection. And the icing on the cake: when one guest in our party drank a bit too much of said delicious wine and fell out of his chair, the manager came over almost apologetically, and very, very, caring.

We were greeted by the owner who pulled a joke on us telling us that the restaurant was closed. But quickly invited us in with opens arms.\nOnce seated a very nice women with a European accent greeted us, asked for allergies, and then went over the specials.

So I went jambalaya.  No its not impossible to make, but I seldom come across good Andouille sausage, not the chicken imitation you can find at your local grocery store.  I can't rave enough about it, it had a spicy kick to it, it was filling, it was smoky, and it was a perfect portion size.  And it was a damn fine meal going to a New Orleans place in Chicago.  \n\nI just wish I had room for the Beignets.  A table nearby got them and they looked delicious.

The plates are all very rich, heavy and filling, a nice thing for once--you get a lot for your money!   If you had drinks, appetizer, meal and dessert all for yourself you would be oversaturated; instead we shared the rich crawfish cheesecake appetizer (like a really rich cheese fish paste in a pie shape) and had to pass on dessert.

He did not know why two of us couldn't have iced tea, even though our neighbors had the iced tea the week before. It turned out that they forgot to make it. The food was pretty good (I had the jambalaya) with the major exception of my wife's pork chop. When she cut it open, the pork chop was raw (not cooked). We sent it back to be cooked and Pearl's gave her some chicken wings to munch on. We had ,prior to ordering, requested two separate checks for our table. That didn't happen. When our waiter took the check back to properly split it up, he disappeared for ten or fifteen minutes. We knew, then, that there was a problem. Indeed, he came back saying that there was a computer problem and they couldn't fix the bill. If we go back, I'm sure no one will order the pork chop.

We also got two free chocolates from the chocolate cart too.\n\nThe food was exceptional! We started off with steak tartare, oyster Rockefeller, and complimentary bread. The steak tartare had a wonderful taste and texture, I would definitely order this dish again.  I ordered a filet mignon which was cooked a perfect medium rare. We were also given a trio of steak sauces to pair with our meal. For sides we had a cornbread and creamed spinach, both paired well with the entree. For dessert, we had their famous peanut butter/cracker jack dish that was light and full of peanut butter flavor.\n\nOverall the service was outstanding, they take your entire order at the beginning to ensure the dinner flows nicely. They have an excellent selection of wine or you can get a cocktail at the bar or form the cocktail cart. Food is pricey but you are definitely getting your money's worth.", "Because of my the amount of entertaining I do for my job, I've literally spent hundreds of evenings dining in Chicago steakhouses.  While I could go on and on about which particular cuts of meat I think are the best across the many great steakhouses in town, I keep finding myself choosing Swift & Son's.  The food here is consistently top notch, but I think it's the vibe, decor and location in the Google Building in the heart of Fulton Market that makes this place my favorite steakhouse.\n\nAs you would expect from the group that brought us GT Oyster, the oysters are always spot on.  If your an oyster eater like I am, you can ask for the menu from Cold Storage (the Oyster Bar that's attached to the restaurant) for a deeper selection.  The best cut on the menu is the massive Bone-in Rib Eye although, for something truly unique, it's worth going all out for the Beef Wellington.  \n\nThe sides are all great but the Brussell Sprouts standout.  Perfectly flash fried with tons of flavor, the Brussell Sprouts here top my list as the best side of any Steakhouse offering in Chicago.", "Updating review.\n\nI went again and the experience was not as good as the first time.\n\nI did not enjoy the gratin potatoes or mushroom side.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nSimply wonderful. I liked the pace of the meal and the food was very good. We had the cold seafood tower and the pasta as appetizers, both worth the money. Our main course was poached lobster and New York strip steak and Brussels sprouts (a must have). A few missteps, but nothing to derail the pleasure of the meal. I would skip the Cracker Jack dessert.\n\nI really enjoyed the multiple spaces and feel of the rooms. I think there's a spot for everyone.\n\nThe oyster bar is suppose to open soon.", "I dine out several times a week for work and this is one of my top 5 go to restaurants.   The wait staff is on point, culinary delights are perfect and constantly evolving, and my guests and I can talk without yelling.  The wine list is pretty satisfying as well.   I love the vaulted ceilings and concrete columns which reflect the Fulton Market's loft vibe.  I've never had a less than perfect experience and is worth every penny of the slightly bit higher price point.  Highly recommend for business dinners, night out with friends, or the romantic date night.", "Great atmosphere, great vibe, food was barely okay.   Salads were good.   Oysters were good according to my friends.  Shrimp cocktail was really good.  They did give us some extras because they spilled a drink on my jacket.  Ended there.  I make a better steak at home.  Can't quite describe it.  KC strip.  Odd texture, very chewy.  Over aged?  Don't know.  Hoping for an Oscar style add on, I got the butter poached crab for $17.  It was on the level of cat food in buttered chicken broth.  Maybe they borrowed a bag of crab chowder from Panera.  I will continue to enjoy my steaks out at Gibson's, Cut, and yes, Ditka's.  I hope they do well and continue to anchor Fulton Market, but they've got some issues to work out in the kitchen.", "Out of Gibson's, Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Chicago Cut and others; S&S takes the cake.

I don't neglect cocktails - that's how good this duck is my friends. Prepared medium rare, the duck was perfectly seasoned with wonderfully crunchy skin and tender meat. It was served with a puree of turnips, and side of chard + cherries with duck sausage.  I can't recommend this dish enough.  Easily the best duck I've had.\n\nSaying that, I also had the STRAWBERRIES + BURRATA with summer herbs.  It was refreshing and complimentary, but also sorta basic.  I've definitely had better burrata before.\n\nThe FROZEN LEMON VERBENA FLUFF with PLUM SORBET was just alright. They nailed it with texture on this dish; plums prepared 3 ways - fresh, candied, and sorbet; and there were julienne strips of candied lemon over the fluff.  I was looking for something refreshing after the duck dish, but was left underwhelmed.", "Stopped in for a snack here while riding bikes a few weeks ago. We had a tea and shared the Banana flax bread and the beet root tartare. I must say that both of these items were superb. The Banana bread  was moist and had a nice extra crunch from the flaxseed. The beet root tartare was served with rye bread crumbs, trout roe, and horseradish. It was light, and very unique. It had a great combination of flavors and textures.\n\nTheir barista must've been having trouble, as it took almost a half an hour to get our tea and coffee drinks. As it was early on a Sunday morning, the place was full of young families and little kids. If I return I will go later in the afternoon.

Smoked trout salad was good. Ingredients of superior quality including the dressing. Server said my salad came with a croissant but that never arrived. Yellow tail appetizer was good but very, very small. The rum chocolate cake fell flat, not because it wasn't light and rich, but because it just didn't work well with the coffee ice cream.  Something was missing, something unfinished about the composition. Lemonade was very good. Cocktails were very expensive for what you got.\nBread was good, but we really have to give them points for free bread, as per other reviews here? Might return here but other restaurants in this area are just trying harder for what you pay.", "Little Park is the sister to the Dutch. While Andrew Carmellini has numerous restaurants, I sort of think of the Dutch and Little Park as bother and sister spots. The Dutch has more meat and less vegetables and appeals to a broader crowd. Little Park is the quieter, more veggie forward and farm to table. It is great for breakfast, lunch, brunch and dinner.", "I had a truly lovely dinner here.  The beetroot tartar with horseradish and smoked trout roe was delicious, refreshing, light, and balanced, and very much a fun play on tartar.  The green spaghetti with walnut, fennel, and ricotta, was also delicious -- somehow, it was rich in flavor without being overly heavy or creamy.  But I had a bite of my dining companion's seared duck and it was phenomenal.  I'd definitely have that the next time I visit.\n\nThe Vervino Spritz and Stoop Kid were wonderfully balanced, complex, perfectly made.

They do everything very well, but that's not what keeps me coming back.\n\nI come back for the tandoori chicken wings, which are not only incredibly addictive, but among one of the finest bites in all of Westchester. What you do is look for the wing part (not the drumstick piece) and enjoy the bonus if it is crispy, which most times it is.  It's juicy, slightly spicy, aromatically complex and quite frankly the finest wings I have ever had. It is on the menu one day in two, the honey based wings are  little less interesting but also good.\n\nThe Koorma is excellent, and if the Vindaloo is a little too mild for spice hounds,it is fine for me.

Being very familiar with North Indian cuisine, and wanting to sample more than just one dish, we ordered appetizers. Because of the NYT review, I had Kalonji (black sesame seed) Scallops at the top of my list.

The flatbread probably came refrigerated direct from the Sysco truck. Unfortunately Warbler seems to be aiming low - like trying to be the best restaurant in the airport.  And, when will people figure out that certain restaurants (like this one) are NOT great to bring your kids under 8?

My husband and I dined on a Saturday night. Every detail from decor to cocktails, food and staff was perfect. I think the chef may be a culinary genius-seriously. Every single thing we had (and we had a lot) was beyond delicious. I suggest ordering the artichokes as an appetizer. Definitely have the green beans and the fresh pasta.

It will be difficult, but try to save room for the amazing brownie and carrot cake desserts.\nI cannot wait for my next visit!", "The Warbler is a welcome addition to the Lincoln Square neighborhood! I visited on opening night and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Service is very friendly here and everyone seems to work together as a team quite well. The space is bright and airy, and the seating is very comfortable as well. There are even little succulent plants on the tables.\n\nThe menu is a mix of everything, and is probably ideally suited for sharing. I tried the kookaburra cocktail, and while it was a pretty tiny pour, the flavor was wonderful. We ordered the romaine salad, the Korean style chicken wings, and the cheeseburger.\n\nThe salad was a wonderful blend of flavors, and I especially liked the spiced pear. My only issue with this dish was how small the portion size was for $9.\n\nThe chicken wings had a delicious flavor, but I wish they were crispier, and I would have loved a dipping sauce on the side.\n\nThe burger and fries are a good value at $11. The patty was cooked perfectly! I do wish they would consider using a different bun, however. Ours was pretty dry and looked over baked.\n\nThese could just be some first day kinks, and I would be happy to return and see how they're doing after a few weeks on business.", "Great restaurant! By the same people as Gather next door.\n\nHad a 9 pm reservation on Friday for 3 of us. They were rather busy so I would recommend making a res, but there is some bar area seating available. I wish it was Summer because they also have some awesome looking patios areas outside.\n\nService was really strong. The host/manager chatted with us while we waited for our table and our server was great too. Excellent cocktail list at reasonable prices. I think I picked one with mezcal first and gin second.\n\nLots of great options for food. We started with the pork belly nachos which were great. Plenty for 2-4 people. I ordered the burger and the broccoli while my friends got the chicken and mushroom pasta. Burger was fantastic, one of the better ones in the city! All the food was outstanding  - we even finished with a skillet cookie. Can never go wrong with that.\n\nThe Warbler is definitely going on my short list. Great work by their team!", "Got here on a Friday night around 7:30pm. Were told it'd be a 45 min wait but ended up finding seats at the bar in just a few minutes?! Score!\n\nWe started with the Tanager and Birdsnest, but unfortunately didn't love either of them. Both felt a bit too sweet.\n\nWe then ordered Butternut Beignets, Whole Wheat Bucatini, and Mushroom Flatbread. The beignets were so original and surprisingly light! They should make a dessert form of them too. The bucatini was probably our fave. Soooo peppery and buttery. Yum! Probably the best I've ever had. Neither of us loved the flatbread. The dough was a softer one and the flavors were kind of bland. Wish we'd tried the curry one instead!\n\nFor dessert we got the Peanut Butter Brownie but with vanilla ice cream instead of banana. It was reallllly rich and pretty big portion. It didn't quite hit the spot for us unfortunately. I think they could've taken it to the next level with a prettier presentation and slightly smaller portions. Maybe with small cubes of brownie with a rolled scoop of ice cream and crumbles around it on a plate.\n\nOverall, cute spot and worth checking out for home-y food!", "Blown away! We ate on the heated patio. Great service and the food was spectacular. The robin cocktail was amazing. The cauliflower is truly out of this world. The nachos and bucatini were also delightful.

Little bit pricey.\n\nAurum left us a wonderful experience. We tried to get a reservation a week before but they were fully booked. Second time we got the reservation and we drove 25 miles to Los Altos downtown. It was a pleasant evening with the music in the nearby park. Location and the vibe of the area was really good.\n\nColors of the restaurant are vibrant. We got the menus and we had\n\nMr potato - We wanted to try this and I would definitely suggest if you are looking for a light appetizer. It is a baked potato but is really crunchy\n\nRaga kofta - This is not a completely Indian Malai kofta if you are looking for it. This has an Italian touch to it. It is filled with cheese but the outer later is deep fried potato. Sauce is a sweet marinara. If you are a fan of malai kofta you can definitely try this.\n\nLamb Curry - I could not find a lamb curry in the menu but they were kind enough to make one for me. Gravy was super tasty and the lamb was really tender.\n\nGhevar Rabdi - Finally this dessert was super light. If you are super full already with the main course and the appetizer then you should try this super dessert as a perfect climax.", "I'm all for artistic plating and fine presentation. Food should appeal to all your senses, not just pass on dishes like RaGa kofta plated so well but tastes almost like having tomato bisque/soup with fried cheeseballs. Except sourness of canned tomatoes based sauce, there was absolutely no flavors of any spice in the dish. You should not compromise on flavors when customers ask for medium spice level, because there is a huge difference between spiced and spicy, well spiced makes it flavorful while spicy means more heat. I'm pretty sure people can make out the difference between canned tomatoes based sauce and fresh tomatoes based ones.\nBiryani had no flavors either, it was mainly cauliflower coated with lots of turmeric paste, the excess turmeric masked out other flavors if there was any.\n\nI really hope Indian restaurants, specially the ones with award winning chefs make a difference in the way food is made and tastes, not just focus on how it's presented.\n\nUpdate: Chef Manish promptly responded to my review and he is absolutely correct, there are many variants of biryani, we ordered biryani carefully looking at the menu hoping to taste the flavors of Mace (Javithri) and Cardamom (Elaichi), but unfortunately we got to taste lots of cauliflower marinated in turmeric paste.", "Overpriced for a regular meal. Had high hopes for this place after reading the reviews here. We tried the Malvani Fish Curry and Old Fashioned Chicken curry. The fish tasted stale. The sauce had no balance and was bitter. I could taste the turmeric, but missing any punch. The tanginess of tamarind was missing. Will not order this again. On the bright side, I actually got credit from my 7 yr old son that my fish tastes better than this :)\nThe chicken curry was good. Good, but nothing special. Will order again.", "Amazing food! We had butter chicken, chicken kebabs, and lamb kebabs - and they were absolutely delicious. The quality and flavor of the food was out of this world. It was the perfect meal for celebrating New Year's Eve! We are so glad that we are able to access this level of high end indian meal during the pandemic. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu.", "Hey hey, there's an Indian restaurant now in downtown Los Altos!  Definitely, a welcomed addition since it's the only one around Main or State Streets.\n\nThe Saag Paneer ($16.95) is a winner.  There was a good texture to this creamed spinach-like dish and I could taste the tiny bits of prominent ginger along with the complexity of spices.  If you like it spicy hot, just ask for it \"extra hot\".  They do spices right here!  Mine came out super spicy, and I don't mean Los Altos-spicy.  I'm talking Delhi spicy.  \n\nIf you're a fan of whole shrimps with heads and tails intact, don't sleep on the Deccan Shrimp ($17.95).  The four ghee roasted shrimps were nicely charred, although a bit salty.  It comes on top of a bed of mung beans with the texture of mashed potatoes.  \n\nIndoor dining will be nice here in their updated and cozy space, once it resumes.  Outdoor dining will also be available.", "Ambience: Beautiful, classy interior. Good for any date.\n\nService: Very on-point. We always had someone check-in every 5-10 mins. Would've appreciated more consistency, and I think the person who waited our table (???) could've been more friendly, especially when explaining the \"favorites\" of the restaurant. He just pointed to the menu items -- would've appreciated more of a description and friendliness.\n\nFood: The cauliflower appetizer came out pretty fast but also pretty cold. The lamb chunks were pretty salty. My favorite was the mushroom pot pie, so many mushrooms and it was a creamy delight. The flaky exterior was buttery and just melts in your mouth with still the right amount of added crunch to the beginning.", "Incredible Indian food comes to Los Altos and many of the dishes are gluten free with spectacular taste. Aurum will make these dishes also Celiac safe upon request. What a blessing to have this restaurant with Chef Manish Tyagi in our town. We love their Butter Chicken (cannot live without this!), Tribal Lamb Stew, Kochi Chicken Kabob, Eggplant Crescents, all of their Curry dishes, and their Chicken Biryani (that's right, a gluten free, Celiac safe Biryani!). Order as is or ask for your food mild like we do. The dishes are worth every dollar because the portions are big. What more can I say except we order takeout and have enough for two nights dinners.

Maybe I ordered the wrong combination of dishes but I found all the dishes to be quite rich.\n\nThey have a good and interesting cocktail selection. Their wine list is also well-selected. I don't know how I feel about their half pours though. All of their wine by the glass is priced at a half-glass pour.

The setting was cozy and spacious with an open kitchen. Bartenders were very slow in prepping drinks. It took over 30minutes until I finally got my drink--a simple glass of champagne.\n\nReading their regular menu I already decided I'll be back even before the first bite. Sadly, their descriptive aspirations fell short of their execution. It started with the colorful caviar toast: gorgeous to the eye but the thick bread masked the pop of the caviar. Next were scallops while impressive in size were unimpressive in taste. I love cacio e pepe and bucatini is a perfect vessel for this homey dish. But the bucatini had such microscopic centers as though having an identity crisis and wanting to be spaghetti. The best course was the crab linguine: the seasoning was spot on. The rest was not memorable for me to write about. I'm a sucker for descriptive menus though, so I'll still want to come back and do a redo. If it falls short a second time, maybe I'll actually begin to learn from my mistakes at some point.", "Amazing restaurant! From the menu to the staff, to the above and beyond efforts to seamlessly incorporate Covid protocols, Tesse is an amazing experience! They have a wine shop connected to the restaurant and the incredible wine list to prove it. Don't be intimidated, their Sommeliers are well informed and can translate whatever you need. The food is absolutely exquisite! All seasonal and as fresh as possible, with multiple ingredients made in house (helloooooo duck prosciutto!). The bone marrow bucatini is divine, the crab simplisme a delight and that vanilla souffl\u00e9e is UNREAL. There isn't a thing I've eaten here that I wouldn't recommend.

Last night Kim made me a Spanish gin and tonic which to be honest I've only experienced in Barcelona. Though the menu features exquisite meat and fish dishes, as a Vegetarian, I have never left feeling anything less than delighted and satisfied by their salads, small plates and vegetarian pastas. To be honest, even coming for just cheese, dessert and wine is an exceptional experience. Thank you to the Tesse team for treating me and my family and friends to yours.", "My experience at Tesse, during a challenging time of worry and insecurity, was one that was needed to pick up my spirit. Outdoor seating against greenery and the classic wooden pieces melded into modern form made me feel like I was away from the madness of the world. Staff was respectful of COVID19 precautions from the masks worn down to the QR code to access the menu. The classic brunch dishes, including the French toast and French omelette, were extraordinary in a way that you wouldn't expect from a common menu item. The French toast was moist on the inside but still allowed your tongue to enjoy the crispy, sweet exterior. The texture of the omelette was as perfect as perfect can get.

I will be back for dinner.", "I came here for a friend's birthday and the food was fantastic. The atmosphere is a bit upscale but also casual.

Thankfully they had a strip steak on the specials. We started with the blue crab and jalape\u00f1o crostini and burrata. Burrata was delish as was the blue crab but the blue crab was a small portion. For mains we had the steak special and the scallops. Both were great, steak was $46 but very tasty. Dessert was not as good as the other two courses. We had the trio of gelatos, goats milk, hazelnut, and bourbon vanilla. The bourbon vanilla had too strong of an alcohol flavor (overpowering), hazelnut was artificial, goats milk has no flavor :-(\nLV lost major points for limited menu as well as poor service.

The chicken was moist, flavorful, and accompanied by pan drippings and root vegetables. Both dishes were light and easily palatable - shying away from the heaviness of Italian cuisine.\n\nThe space is airy and open but full of downtown suits enjoying post-work pre-dinner apertifs.

This is largely thanks to its strict sourcing standards (tortillas are made from scratch with heirloom corn) and wholesome plant-based food. Large portions showcase plenty of local produce, but that nacho cheese drizzled all over your butternut squash- and caramelized onion-filled tortilla is crafted from\u2014nuts, of course. These colorful, vegan items explode with flavor, as seen in the enchiladas con mole packed with potato, zucchini and peas, then topped with tomatillo salsa, crema and avocado. The surprises keep coming throughout the meal.\nTake note of the flan, which created sans eggs still manages to have that trademark wobble.", "yelp_reviews": ["I stumbled upon Gracias Madre while searching for the best meat-free fare that San Francisco has to offer. The favorable reviews drew me in, but so did the restaurant's concept; the religious inspiration is apparent in its name, as well as the huge mosaic on the wall, and yet there's also a second \"madre\" acknowledged in a less overt manner: Mother Earth.\n\nOrganic, farm fresh, and locally sourced, the food celebrates the Earth and the plant-based ingredients derived from it. As a result, certain aspects of dishes can change with the seasons. But despite these occasional modifications, Mexican cuisine always remains at the heart of Gracias Madre's menu.\n\nMy choice, the Quesadilla De Calabaza, features butternut squash and caramelized onions, along with spicy cashew nacho cheese. The cashew cheese mimics traditional cheese in consistency, although not so much taste-wise; I don't get the impression that it's trying to taste like the real thing either, allowing the quesadilla to take on a flavor profile that's entirely its own. A creamy green & white sauce on top provides a great alternative to sour cream, and a sprinkle of cilantro and pumpkin seeds adds the final touch.\n\nGracias Madre is the perfect option for vegans and non-vegans alike. This place is redefining vegan and Mexican cuisine, one quesadilla at a time.", "Authentic Mexican made 100% vegan. Gracias Madre was easily one of the food highlights of my recent San Francisco visit. The food is delicious, the service was on point (especially notable given the sizeable crowd that evening), and the dining space was cozy and inviting. Our group of four opted for the enclosed patio seating which was the perfect environment to enjoy an intimate conversation in the midst of a somewhat busy scene.\n\nFrom smoothies, tortas, tacos, enchiladas, salads and desserts, there is something for all palates. I ordered the Enchiladas Verdes made with two rolled tortillas filled with potato, zucchini, and peas topped with tomatillo salsa, crema and avocado. I devoured about half of it, but couldn't finish it all. I'd recommend this spot to anyone on any diet: well-seasoned dishes for herbivores and carnivores alike.", "I really loved this place.\nI am writing this review after having been to both Gracias Madre in the city and its sister restaurant in Berkeley, and I have to say that this place was really good especially in comparison.\nIt's been about two weeks since I went to Gracias Madre so I don't remember the name of the dishes, but their was an appetizer made with eggplant and their cashew nacho sauce which amazing! Special tip here - order a side of their delicious corn tortillas to eat this with - actually, that's my only complaint - this appetizer really should come with them on their own as it's more of a dip type of feel. We also had the enchiladas con mole. They were good, but I think my favorite aspect of this dish was the refried black beans. We shared their flan at the end which was more like a cheesecake than a flan, but never the less YUM. Our meal was accompanied by a couple of micheladas. I wish they would have done it the more traditional way, because these weren't that good. But I must say the service and the food was just enough for me to give it five stars, but honestly just barely. I will definitely be back. It is one of our new faves.", "This place has an interesting menu but a little over priced for what you get.  If vegan is the only thing you do the. I guess this is okay.  So so.  The problem here is the service.  I came with a large group and the waitress missed a few orders and then took a long time to clear our table.  Btw they insist on large parties outside.  So the sun is in your eyes.  Then there is the Cakage fee of 4$!  Why would anyone charge this.  I asked the manager for a deal on that ridiculous fee because we had a large party and he said four slices would be okay.  I took it to mean four plates.  So we got a few plates and shared a little cake.  The manger stormed out and yelled at the entire party and admonished the whole group.  Then he counted the cake pieces out loud in order the embarrass us.  Told us we would have pay for 9 slices! We threw our cake back in the box and left.  Really thank you for ruining my friends party.  Real class act!! That is 11 people who will never go there and of course their family and friends.  All for about 25$!  Bad management!! ..", "This place is officially on my list of top vegan food in the city.\n\nThe only negative is that the service was really slow both times I went.  But hey, I don't live in L.A. anymore and people are much more laid back and relaxed in SF.  Note to self :)\n\nThe food is affordable and pure deliciousness.  I was warned that the food can be \"heavy\"  depending on what you order.  I ordered the tacos both times I went (mushrooms, greens, and butternut squash).  The mushroom ones are my favorite!   I said 'no' to the cashew cheese (which apparently is also amazeballs), but that's only because I didn't want a heavy meal.\n\nI highly recommend this place..,just get there early to avoid long waits and they won't seat a table until every person in the party is there...so take note and enjoy!", "Expensive Mexican food, but very impressed what they did using only vegan ingredients.\n\nMy favorite part of the meal was the margarita which wasn't too complicated but had some flourishes that made it something else. There was some citrus infused salt on the rim that made me happy, I'd recommend it.\n\nFor dinner I had the special which were cactus (nopales) tacos. They reminded me of fajitas without the meat. They came with beans and rice, which is enough to satisfy me.\n\nFor desert, I had the flan which again, blew me away with how good it was for having no dairy or eggs."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/gracias-madre-san-francisco?hrid=7ULdybTTinJ43n8jyyOlyQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gracias-madre-san-francisco?hrid=LxG1avOkByJdGh2my9EjOw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gracias-madre-san-francisco?hrid=QC7d2TcRmK_otb_VpNMibQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gracias-madre-san-francisco?hrid=YX6xgvtgAYp61HycVZjknA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gracias-madre-san-francisco?hrid=8btaCpb4pXslA7vtMwAHDA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gracias-madre-san-francisco?hrid=NjRAWWpdXVN8_LYSv_JogQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Jajaja", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/jajaja-plantas-mexicana-new-york/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/jajaja", "michelin_pov": "This local sure has that sunny south-of-the-border disposition with its tiled walls, wood booths, and turquoise chairs, but there\u2019s nothing typical about it.

It's accessible to even non-vegans like myself and has plenty of options as well as a delicious cocktail menu. For the drinks, I really enjoyed my pineapple and mezcal which was both sweet and smoky.\n\nFor the food, we started with the beet and pumpkin empanada which I highly recommend. You just get one so be aware it's a small bite. That said the filling was delicious and super flavorful. We then ordered a selection of tacos  (2 per order) which was a fun way to sample a number of different flavors. My favorite was the crispy chayote fish (not actually fish of course, but the fried squash really hit the spot) followed by the chorizo which really did have the same texture as true ground pork. I would just skip the buffalo cauliflower which was so-so. Lastly, we ended on a sweet note with the churros. They were baked to perfection - crispy on the outside and soft in the center.\n\nOverall it was an excellent meal accessible to vegans and non-vegans alike. Fun place for a small group of friends or with a date!", "Empanada (4.75 stars): perfectly crispy crust (no soggy bottoms here), well cooked squash and beet filling (and excellent filling to crust ratio with no gaps), and medley of lovely chimichurri and salsas\n\nEnchilada mole (4.75 stars): loved the whole dish. The tortillas were soft but still with some chew, and mole bad depth, and that rice! I don't normally eat much rice but this was savory, well spiced, and coconutty\n\nChile relleno (4 stars): packed full of veggies, and the sauce was actually spicy! Don't expect the usual pulled cheese here, but there is a nice delicate tempura crust\n\nAlmond horchata was fun (still sweet but much better than run of the mill versions). Got it with espresso. Service was nice. Very easy to get reservations for brunch although lots of space in this location (with sun drenched rooms!). Overall, love that they are able to develop so much flavor in every dish; you really don't miss the meat, and they let the veggies shine. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!", "They have a great little backyard/patio setup that's warm(er) and sheltered, though I have to say the interior is beautiful and I can't wait to sit in the blonde wood booths when indoor dining is allowed.\n\nNote that the tacos are two per order, so it is perfect for sharing and trying a bunch. I tried the chipotle sweet potato, crispy chayote fish, and the paleo caveman. The chipotle sweet potato was the most uninspiring, but it wasn't bad. The crispy chayote fish was really good - the interior had a creamy texture and it was deep fried in a flavorful batter; can't really go wrong with that. The Paleo Caveman could have used more mushrooms and less peppers, but that's just me.\n\nThe azteca chile relleno was tasty and full of vegetably goodness but I felt like it lacked fat and creaminess. The coconut queso quesadilla had both crisp and cheesy textures and I'd recommend that as well. I don't know what the churritos were made of, and it seemed to be made from some kind of gluten-free tapoica or rice flour that felt a little mochi-like, but I liked the chewy and soft texture contrasted with the crispy, sugar-coated outside.\n\nI'm an omnivore, and I still liked the food. I'd definitely come back and try some of their other dishes.", "As a loyal frequent of the OG jajaja I was so excited to find out about the opening of the new location!

Quesadillas (flour), tacos (corn), tortas, and sides were the categories.\n\nRoasted pork wasn't what I wanted so I refrained from the Cochinita Pibil and ordered one Birria, one Quesabirria, and one Longaniza taco. Each one was dressed with cilantro and onion while a cup of salsa and lime slices were provided on the side. The beef in the birria was very good, but I committed the faux pas of not asking for consomme and bone marrow as extras. For some reason, I thought the quesabirria taco came with marrow so I was disappointed not to see it included.\n\nI felt the longaniza was the star of the show because of the spiciness in the sausage meat.

The corn, sausage and cajun fries dipped in the manic sauce was delish!\nIt does get messy and I unfortunately spilled some drink on the guy sitting next to me (my hands were oily and slippery :( but he was a sport!). We did sit on the same table on the 4 table top.  \nI love flavors. I love seafood. I love beer. And this was a great marriage between all of them. Please give this place a try if you are a cajun spice/seafood lover :)", "While the food may be quite good, it was not at all worth the wait or lackluster customer service. We waited in line on a Sunday brining at 12:30pm because they opened at 1. We were happily seated in the first group of customers allowed in and quickly ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our food order was in by 1:10pm. When did it arrive? 2:37pm in the waiting process we watched EVERY other table in the room receive their food, then mentioned to the manager that we hadn't received ours and was quickly brushed off with 'Everybody came in at once' blah blah blah. And he was right, everyone had come in at once, and everyone else had food and as actually packing up and leaving.\n\nSeriously.\n\nNew tables were coming in and we still hadn't received our order yet. I have NEVER been more disappointed and had the worst first experience at a restaurant that I have ever had.\n\nThis is not a $10/pp establishment, everyone here pays about $30-$60/pp and it is completely irresponsible of ownership and management to allow things of this nature to occur. DO NOT waste your money and, more importantly, DO NOT waste your time at this horrible excuse for a restaurant!!!", "I wanted to like this place. Hubs was so excited to go, but overall it was a letdown. He ordered the special of the day, which was a whole fried fish (I believe it was a red snapper). I think the oil wasn't hot enough (I watch a lot of cooking shows) because the fish was greasy and, sadly, fishy. We ended up bringing a lot of it home and making fish tacos the next day, which were alright. The bed of rice it was served on was sticky, stale, and just not good, like it had been cooked much earlier in the day.\n\nBased on the other reviews, we ordered the garlic noodles, but they were also a letdown. They were garlicky enough but they had a boxed flavor to them, like the Pasta Roni I ate in college. I don't know, maybe we should go back and try one of their regular items, like a giant bag of shrimp or crab legs. But I do not look forward to piling up the shells on the table and saying \"how do I eat this?\" and \"Man, most of this is going to end up on my sleeves\" like I heard from the table next to us.\n\nOn the bright side, it's BYOB.", "This place needs an inspection by the City.

This is NOT a \"sushi place\" so don't come here if that's what you're looking for - kaiseki (\u61d0\u77f3) is a very traditional Japanese multi-course meal, which incorporates sushi but also other dishes like soups and grilled or braised fish.\n\nHave been to Yoichi's several times at different times of the year, and each time at least one (sometimes all) of the courses caused us to stop, stare wide-eyed at each other, and ask how we were tasting something so impossibly unique and delicious. Yoichi has more than once prepared meals that were better than what I had during years traveling in Japan. The fish is unbelievably fresh, the taste and texture is absolutely perfect, and each meal is seasonal, inventive yet in keeping with traditional kaiseki, and flows perfectly together. The sake pairings are always spot on as well. How they don't yet have a Michelin star is beyond me.", "7 course dinner was even more amazing than we expected. The black cod was so perfectly cooked and flavorful; the sashimi was cut so we could immediately see how fresh it was; the unagi wasn't covered in a super sweet \"unagi sauce\" but instead was served in a flavorful, slightly sweet broth; the house-made mochi crepe with red bean paste and cherry blossom leaf was one of the most simply, delicately satisfying and balanced desserts I've ever had. Nothing here to distract customers of their strive for simple elegance.\nThe waitresses were friendly, knowledgable, and professional. They recommended how to eat certain items and explained the dessert should be taken with green tea. Small suggestions like that made my girlfriend and I feel very comfortable.\nThis is not the sushi place you are used to in the U.S., it is something so far surpassing and each dish was an expression of authentic, artistic passion. I'm happy we did the set dinner for our first visit, but I'm excited to go back for some sashimi snacks as well. Also can't wait for their liquor license to be approved-- it would be nice to have drink recommendations to pair with the set menu!", "The seafood is sooooo fresh. Although it might be one of the most expensive restaurants in SB, 100 for one person, the food and service deserve it. Each one could have seven courses, with choice for entree, soup, grill and sushi. My favorite is the black cod! Can't believe it could be so fresh as well as so tasty! I have been here two times this month and found that they changed their menu a little. Really recommend!", "OK, my wife and I are Japanese food experts.  We live in Santa Barbara and Tokyo having residences in both places.  Yoichi's is the real deal--same as Tokyo.  If you want authentic Japanese food, not the Amer-Japanese concoctions of most of the Japanese restaurants in the U. S., or Japanese restaurants run by Koreans, Hispanics and other non-trained chefs, Yoichi's is the place.  This is an outstanding restaurant run by a chef who simply knows his trade and prepares every dish to perfection.  Santa Barbara (the whole West Coast) is lucky to have such a wonderful restaurant.  If eating gourmet Japanese food is your thing, like it is to my wife and I, look no further, go straight to Yoichi's", "Until now a visit to Santa Barbara has always been bittersweet - yes we love the pristine Spanish mission style promenade... yes we love the long stretches of ocean shore.... ohhhh...but the Japanese food....yikes\n\nTHEN... like a gift from the sea comes Yoichi. A former chef from Nobu Tokyo, Yoichi brings lovely, thoughtful, wonderful Kaiseki to this off the strip dining room.\n\nThis (reasonable compared to  other equivalent spots) set menu is delicious - and nothing like any other dining experience in SB.\n\nThis is maybe the first 'destination' restaurant I have found in SB to date - and against the rather meager competition I give it easily 5 stars on the Santa Barbara scale.\n\nHere is the hitch... this place is NOT packed - and SB seems not to get what they have here... Ladies and Gentleman of the coast - get your collective heads out of your spicy tuna rolls and celebrate what you have here - before you loose it!\n\nThank you Yoichi - Great spot!", "My go to spot during covid. Their bento boxes were my absolute favorite. There is not one bad thing in each box. Fresh sashimi, miso salmon and black cod, and duck and Wagyu beef. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!", "This place was the highlight of my work-trip to Santa Barbara last week. To be honest, I'm never really impressed with SB restaurants but THIS ONE pleasantly surprised me with its exceptionally high quality dishes and the service they provided. It was my first time Kaiseki experience and, BOY, had I been missing out on this amazing  treasure! The food was prepared with freshest ingredients anywhere, which is an integral core for Japanese cuisine. If you are looking for rolls prepared with cream cheese and mayonnaise, this place is definitely not for you. But, if you are a genuine Japanese food enthusiast, this will be your favorite spot for authentic Japanese gourmet. I'd definitely come back to SB just to visit this restaurant.

The main reason I like this place is that they have a proper menu with all of the things you could possibly order, with pictures!  You are given a list with all of the dishes that they offer.  You write down the quantity you want for each item on the list, hand it to one of the employees, they generate a receipt that lists all of the items you ordered (it's in Chinese though), and the items start coming out.  The employees will cross out each item that they've placed on your table.  \n\nThis is great system because you don't have to spend the majority of your time spinning your head trying to find the lady with the right cart (don't you hate it when you can't find the cheong fun??).  Given how crazy some dim sum places can be, this one's calmer and more organized than the others.  Oh and the dim sum is pretty legit/tasty!  \n\nParking in the lot can be tough during the busy hour, but we usually score parking on Rosemead.", "The three of us got here at 2:10 pm on Friday and we were seated right away.  We ordered 8 items promptly and the dim sum came out quickly, fresh and piping HOT!  You can't beat that if you're rolling a cart.   My husband loved the healthy bitter melon rice roll, very different!   My daughter's favorites are French bbq pork bun and lo-bak-go, which she deemed gourmet and interesting in texture.  I treasured the desserts, the egg white tart and steamed milk for its tasty smooth creaminess. Service was spot-on attentive.  Yes, it was a little pricey for dim sum, about $60 for 3 people.  But we understand the quality and unique dishes are worth the money.  Overall, an excellent first-visit experience.  Now we are thinking of bringing friends to dine with us the next time we come back.", "Some people like waiting in long lines with numbers waiting to be called to sit down and eat. For us we are that type, where we want to go and try out all the dim sum that each place has to offer. For this one particular restaurant, they have all kind of yummy dishes from har gow and shumai but my favorites is the deserts like the fried buns with salty egg yolk oozing out of it when you bite into it. Another favorite is this multi layer durian where you get a piece of it as you bite into it. It is stinky and tasty but don't get me wrong. This place is a little pricy with no carts so you have to order off the menu and then it arrives fresh to your table.", "We were in LA for a wedding and wanted to have authentic dim sum. Thanks to reviews from Ferdinand H and Michael L, we found this restaurant.\n\nOverall, the food is made from very fresh ingredient and perfectly seasoned and sauced. The best example is spareribs with black bean sauce. I could taste the black bean, yet it's not overpowering and compliments the pork very well. I'd have to say this is the best dim sum I ever had....better than the ones I had while growing up in Malaysia. Some people may find the food bland, especially if their idea of good Chinese food is something like sweet and sour pork, General Tso's chicken...etc. This is authentic Cantonese cooking where the delicate, balanced flavor highlights freshness of the ingredients.", "This is an update. I normally come here for their dim sum, but I came out on christmas day for dinner. Turns out they're literally open 365 days a year. Must suck to work there, but good for the customers. Their Chinese food is definitely a cut above most of the restaurants in the san gabriel valley. Their seafood is always very fresh, their vegetables are crisp and not overly cooked, their fried dishes are lightly breaded and never greasy. Everything is light and not overly seasoned or cook.

The menu looked excellent, and while we were a little nervous about it being too upscale, we found quite a variety in how guests were dressed, both inside and outside. The service was good, though a little chilly and slow, and the appetizer was delicious: the pork pate de compagne with a small bit of greens. Very tasty and fresh and the toast was hot. We had the Paloma cocktail, which was delicious but a bit thin for $13. The entrees were a mixed bag: the orecchiette with pork Ragu was tasty though a bit on the spicy hot side. And the toast on the side was a strange accompaniment for pasta. The mussels were weird... Funky, briney, broth that was much too salty, and quite spicy hot. It wasn't an exciting meal; the pate is something we'd return for, but otherwise I'd say don't visit for the food items we had.", "Holy Crap.

Yep...I am pretty much a cow.\nAll I can say is that the food is visually stunning and tastes heavenly. Absolutely worth the $400 bucks I dropped.

I like that the skewers are very lightly seasoned so you get to appreciate the beef flavor, and have the ability to add additional salt and spice if you choose to do so once the dish arrives in front of you.\n\nWould definitely come back!", "Newly opened, Omakase menu covered the entire a-la-carte items, so it was definitely worth the money. Many of the items utilize the coal pit at the center and have well refined subtle smokiness.\n\nPairing - Best part of the experience. Some very unexpected pairing that works beautifully. There were three kinds of pairings: beverage, wine, reserved wine. We had beverage pairing and reserved wine pairing. beverage paring had better mariage vs the reserved wine pairing, except for the sauced meat dishes (later two of the four meat skewers) and king mushroom dish.\n\nAtmosphere - Square bar table with kitchen at the center. The kitchen has the coal pit counter, with prep area around. Good selection of plates, utencils, glasswareand other serving wares.\n\nService - almost one staff to two customer ratio. Minor details like very light stain on anything will be taken care of \"without fuss\".\n\nWe were on our most casual attire (tech attire - jeans and shirts with backpack) but the atmosphere allowed us to mingle in without feeling out of place (kind of mixture of yakitoriya and modern-casual kaiseki with western spin)", "I ordered the amazing box from TOCK and pickup by myself.  Since GOZU opened for outdoor dinning been awhile, probably pickup is not the main income, so when I get there, I have to find one who can help me with my pickup order...\n\nThe box is limited, only 10 order per day. The box itself is cheap, it's plastic, super light weight, please be careful when you move down each tire, it will easily fall down....\n\nThe dish is good, but compare with price, I felt that's overpriced, I'd like to come back when legally open indoor dining, I believe the experience of seat in front of the open kitchen will worth more.", "Gozu was one of the first places I went to at the start of 2020, and had a great and delicious experience inside their restaurant. Fast forward almost 11 months later, and the world as we know it has significantly changed. One of the things that Gozu now offers instead of an inside dining experience is a tiered bento box. Two delicious tiers that consisted of some pickled vegetables along side some desserts/sweets for later, and a bottom tier that is filled with rice, vegetables, and different preparations of wagyu. The packaging is so incredibly pretty, and I appreciate the small details that are put into making sure that just because you're eating their food at home doesn't mean it has to look terrible. I loved this, maybe more than I loved my indoor experience early on in the year. I know these bentos aren't cheap, but the level of detail and effort that goes into it makes it worthwhile!", "I came in for a pre-opening event this past week, not knowing quite what to expect. This place is a magic oasis for high-end food and drinks with knowledgeable, intimate service.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you can smell the aromatic scent of wood burning from their open flame stove. Every single employee in this restaurant cares about the little details that make the dishes unforgettable and the atmosphere welcoming.\n\nI did not take photos of all the dishes (mostly because the beef I was too quick to eat and forgot ), but I hope the ones I did take do them justice. Also, even the dishes that are not beef still have beef in some form! Ask the chefs and they'll explain.", "Great experience during COVID times. Guidelines were followed and our group of 3 sat fireside. There were only 5 other people dining in the restaurant, so we received a greatly personalized and intimate dining experience.\n\nDon't be afraid to ask for Japanese whisky during your wine pairing, as they are quite amazing!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/gozu-san-francisco?hrid=zhJLtNxk3XiUKflHfrgTYg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gozu-san-francisco?hrid=8hCILgRHKKU6Q7gAwUdnSA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gozu-san-francisco?hrid=S6g1XqMwyZrbJDPlM4Dk9Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gozu-san-francisco?hrid=Sr6tgbFIMcRHjK6R1iJR4A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gozu-san-francisco?hrid=70KpkfzUVQDU5BHyOk60iQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gozu-san-francisco?hrid=FJ1vtyTeeaKQLHf7wJ08pg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/gozu-san-francisco?hrid=crZR4sIqd8TJNOZhjHZjUQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Bellwether", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/bellwether-long-island-city/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/bellwether", "michelin_pov": "With black floors, stark white tables, and white chairs, Bellwether looks a little too cool for comfort, but don\u2019t let that fool you.

Love the onions and the sauce it came with.\n\nThe mushroom linguine was just as good too. The brocolini was a pleasant surprise. They cooked it to differently from the typical way, with pickled carrots and a bit of citrusness.\n\nTheir selection of wine is vast for ordering by the glass. They have interesting cocktails and mocktails too. But we stick with wine. No complaints at all about this place.

Took our drink orders quick and was attentive. Menus come and down hill it went...\n\nThis place doesn't have salt and pepper on the table which makes me believe that the kitchen doesn't have any either. The avocado appetizer was full of flavorless Olive oil and a ton of dried herbs. Why not just throw on some simple lemon juice, salt, pepper and fresh dill? Bland..... oh well.\n\nLittle gem lettuce, meh... once again needs some salt.\n\nSeared black bass. Tasted way to fishy and once again no salt or pepper.\n\nCornish hen. Decent, little oily and you guessed it lacking simple seasoning.\n\nSkipped dessert.\n\n$150 later, left and felt like grabbing a taco from the truck across the street would have been a better experience.\n\nSimple advise from a local who eats at every LIC location please use salt and pepper when seasoning dishes or at least place them on the table and give the diner the choice. It's not a taboo it's common sense. Good luck.\n\nP.S. Change the oil for the fries  and don't serve the little overcooked leftover pieces.", "So happy we gave this restaurant a chance! We live in the area and will definitely be back. Their speciality cocktails were great, I cannot remember the name of the cocktail but it was a mezcal with grapefruit drink, highly recommend.

Entrees we had grilled flank steak seasoned well and the bellwether patty melt also amazing.", "Loved this place! TBH I was a little hesitant to go in because it looks *SO* modern and fancy from the outside, but the menu and execution really distinguishes them from other New American places.  Brunch was very inventive, with three bloody mary choices (vodka, tequila or gin?). The coffee was Irving Farms and very good.\n\nThe FOOD was fantastic. Beignets with strawberry whipped cream are a must-get for the table. Not oily or heavy at all. So light and fluffy and not too sweet - perfection. Everyone was really happy with their food: breakfast taco salad was unique and looked great, the patty melt is more like a burger (I've never seen more gorgeous pieces of toast) and served with a generous helping of fries, and the steak and eggs were perfect. Side of hash browns was AWESOME if you're into fried potatoes.\n\nOur server was super nice and friendly. Reservations not really needed if you go on the early side for weekend brunch, but I'd recommend for larger parties and it does start to fill up right at noon.", "Had a surprisingly delicious meal here. Service was excellent.\n\nWe had:\n\nArctic char - I appreciated the ample amount of veggies that came with this dish - from the squash ribbons (creative and delicious) to the fresh arugula. The basil-sunflower oil pesto was what really brought it all together though, infusing the squash ribbons with flavor. Arctic char itself was very tender and superbly cooked.\n\nHalloumi - This was quite good, nicely grilled piece of halloumi covered with veggies\n\nBeets - Probably the least exciting dish we tried, just a handful of golden beets over a yogurt, but still yummy.\n\nPanna cotta - I think I was underwhelmed by the desert, finding the panna cotta too dense for my tastes.\n\nAll in all, huge fan of the mains / apps - beautiful plating and light, but flavorful dishes with ample veggies.", "Bellwether is an apt name for an establishment that stands out from the flock, and is another cool, chic, and forward thinking restaurant that is synonymous with LIC.\n\nThe wait staff are knowledgeable and very helpful, and our server made some very good recommendations. The beef carpaccio came with a 10/10 rating and it certainly delivered when paired with the homemade potato chips. The patty melt was the most memorable dish for me and packed a wallop of decadence and richness. There are several rotating specials, and the emphasis on fresh ingredients is evident no matter what you choose. To get the most of your visit, make sure to save room for the banana chocolate dessert, which is served on a br\u00fbl\u00e9e brioche with salted peanut butter caramel.\n\nThe cocktails are well made and I would recommend giving them a go, and the wine list is well curated so it may be worth pairing a bottle with dinner.\n\nA beautiful space, with a particularly sharp and attentive staff, and a well executed food and drink menu that melds different flavors and styles together flawlessly to make for a quality experience.", "Dropped by for an early dinner. Delicious summery cocktails. The food is fresh and bright. We started with the oysters. They're drizzled in oil and served atop a bed of sea salt. So good. Next we had the charred cabbage.

I've been coming since they opened and have not been disappointed once. Everything they make is amazing and I wish I could eat here every single night. Amazing customer service, incredibly delicious and creative cocktails, and each dish crafted with care from seasonal local ingredients. If you go you must get their house made bread which Bill, one of the owners, makes fresh daily and is probably the best bread I've ever had in my entire life. Also you have to get the milk and honey ice cream with honeycomb and olive oil, which at first sounds kind of funny but is an amazing experience. The sweetness of the ice cream combined with the caramel, toasted flavor of the honeycomb , is paired with the fruity vegetal flavor of the olive oil and makes for one very unique dessert.

The service was top notch from the hostess, bartender to the server.  We started with the 'winger bakery bread' which was served with butter & sea salt sprinkled atop the butter.  We also tried the 'fluorescent farm watermelon' which was topped with marash chili / red shiso - who knew watermelon could be so tasty.  Next was the 'summer chopped salad' - came with corn, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, shishitos, sunflower & cheddar, the flavors all blended so well, it was delightful.  \nThe mains: 'roasted half chicken' served with pole beans, red peppers & fresh mozzarella; followed by the\n' klingeman ranch ham chop', with butter beans, grapes & crispy shallots; lastly the 'flat iron grass fed steak' along with roasted tomatoes, Yukon whipped potatoes & sauce, so screaming good.

It's like a taste of the big city in a small town. I've tried a couple cocktails, and the Range Water is definitely a favorite- so tasty and refreshing. The Paloma is also a winner! Their food menu is always changing, but I've tried the rockfish, steak, salmon crudo, a cheese/peach/mint toast, and a duck liver pate with huckleberry (which was surprising very delicious with such a unique sweet and savory-ness to it!). I haven't been disappointed by anything I've had here. The food is unique and delicious, and just the right portion size too! The cocktails are also creative and well balanced.\nOverall this place is just great; really nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and amazing food and drinks.

I can't even describe the amount of flavor in that dish it was seriously glorious my husband who is a total burger guy was at first skeptical at the small and unfamiliar items on the menu but was quickly impressed by the flavors.

It was very good, but I grow a lot of veggies myself, so $12 for one piece of toast with a few slices of tomato, cheese spread & basil seemed too expensive. I had a vegetable curry dish which was very good, but at $23 a bit pricey. My husband ordered a steak cooked medium and it came very rare and with much gristle. That was bad. And expensive. We finished with a chocolate mouse that was delicious. The restaurant was too warm, and the seating was either a wooden bench or cheap looking hard chairs. The waiter was very good and the food came out in a timely manner. Other than the steak, the food and service were good. The value could be better.", "I've come here for brunch and dinner, hoping to be wowed by the trendy atmosphere, locally-sourced ingredients, and cool-looking dishes.\n\nBrunch\n- Tilley Farm Eggs & Bread Salad: This was pretty tasty, and I probably could've eaten more if my stomach wasn't so full.\n\n- Patty Melt: This sandwich was filled with so much goodness.

No line, no wait at 930 and we found ourselves in a cute and cozy restaurant.\n\nThe menu boasts locally sourced and organic dishes.  My son opted for the pancakes (fluffy and tasty!) and I couldnt decide between the nanadict (eggs benedict) or the chilaquiles. I asked our server for his input and he said \"huevos rancheros\".  OK, since I couldnt up my mind, I let him decide and huevos rancheros it is.   It was a tad spicy but flavoful.  And the eggs were perfectly over easy. I liked the crisp tortilla, but liked them even more when they got a little mushy from absorbing all the flavors from the veggies, chorizo and poblano cream.

I had a pork shoulder with grits and greens that made me weep a little because it was just THAT beautiful and amazing.  \n\nThey are currently doing fried chicken dinners on Sundays for $22 a person that is worth every penny.  I went with one other person and we got deviled eggs for a starter, biscuits, brussel sprouts, jalapeno coleslaw, mac and cheese, chicken and a full size dessert each.

It's pretty terrible on a good day. The servers are never smiling, never tell you what the specials actually are and depending on the day may or may not refill your coffee.

My favorite is the nana benedict ($13.) Why? because it is made different compared to most restaurants! It has chorizo and I never had a benedict with chorizo.  It also has a spicy, Latin-influenced spin on the familiar hollandaise brunch standards.  It is served with housemade chorizo, poached eggs, and poblano cream all atop two pupusas (masa flatbread, for those not in the know) the spice was very apparent, but not impossible to get used to, especially when combined with the fluffy poached eggs and the crunch of the pupusas.

I wouldn't label the place as unfriendly, however there seemed to be a lack of genuine warmth with welcoming us and no one ever came by during our meal to ask how everything was going. Surprising. When people came to clear away plates there was no warmth on their part. We also felt quite rushed with getting our bill paid which felt uncomfortable. Some of the items on the menus were poorly explained by staff. The crispy rice was awesome and the chicories salad was fresh and tasty. The braised pork was underwhelming. The corkage seemed quite high. They need to better corkage pricing for locals..\nIt was somewhat disappointing. I may give it another try, but just not sure. By the way, I love supporting our local businesses.", "I finally tried Valley after wanting to try it for quite some time. I was very excited that finally there was a restaurant that didn't serve the standard wine country fare of steak frites, roast chicken and seared salmon. The menu was interesting, albeit short. We liked or loved every thing we ate. The shrimp roll  was fantastic and the XO deviled eggs were very unique and decadent. Don't miss the braised pork or the crisp rice. I would have definitely recommend going here but for the horrible service.\n\nI understand that there is a staff shortage but this wasn't about having to wait too long for my food or my plates to be cleared. It was the staff's attitude. They seemed curt and disinterested. There was zero warmth; instead I got the sense that I was supposed to feel grateful to dine there. No one welcomed us into the restaurant, no one asked us how (or if) we were enjoying our food and no one said goodbye when we left. Apparently l, basic hospitality is no longer envogue.\n\nWe were a group of four and spent $400 with tax and tip to eat at a restaurant we had to order from a counter and be grateful for the privilege to do so.\n\nGiven the poor service experience, it's not worth the money.", "I'm so happy to find a new fun wine bar on the plaza with great ambience.  The staff are careful and considerate, the tables are spaced far apart and you order at the bar to keep contact to a minimum.  We started with shishito peppers (serving size was on the small side) and the boiled eggs - which were incredible and we had to order more. We split the salmon which was well prepared and had 2 great white wines an Albari\u00f1o from Spain and another white from Hungary.  Reservations and masks required!", "Valley blew us away! We practically ordered everything on the menu because it all looked so good! I'm vegetarian and my husband loves seafood and yet we both were so thrilled! The wine is incredible and awesome beers we had never tried. The service was incredible. As for COVID 19, Valley also made us feel so comfortable with its protocols during these times. Above and beyond what I have seen other restaurants do! Dying to make it back there ASAP!", "Valley is a superb addition to the restaurant scene in Sonoma. Imaginative and delicious cuisine with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. The wine list sets this restaurant apart with well priced selections from smaller European and California producers with an emphasis on Artisinal proprietors. The vibe is smart but casual and is enhanced by a fabulous outdoor space. Best show in town by far.", "It's about time I leave a review here. Valley is my favorite restaurant/bar in Sonoma. Let me first start with the incredible staff and hospitality. From the second you walk in you feel welcomed. The design of the restaurant is stunning, the wine is first class and the food is out of this world (innovative, seasonal and executed to perfection). I love either sitting at their bar or snagging a table in their beautiful patio. I highly recommend getting some friends together, ordering anything and everything on the menu and sharing some tasty wine here. You won't be disappointed.", "Loved the food here!

And has a beer house type feeling with the benches for their big tables.  Nice and dimly lit atmosphere.  It is a welcomed addition to the grunge feeling of Alphabet City/East Village/Lower East Side restaurants.\n\nThe food itself is actually pretty good. I had the garlic beef rice dish. I found it full of flavor and has a more home cooking style than what you would normally find at other Thai places.  Simple, meat and rice dish. Nothing else.

The spiciness of the food is unlike that of any other food you have had. It is not overpowering, but compliments the natural flavors of the fresh ingredients offered here. One of the best things I have had is the soup with chicken wings-- so warm and tasty, my mouth is actually watering as I type this review. Another dish that is to die for is their pork skewers with coconut -- the pork is so tender and delicious and the coconut noodles that accompany it are so light and juxtapose the spicy sauce it's served with perfectly. You should also get one of their juices to calm the hotness of the food, so sweet and delicious.", "For delicious authentic Thai food, Somtum Der is the place to go. They have a location in Bangkok that I've also had the opportunity to visit. There are a few differences in the menu, but for the most part it's the same, as is the food quality. You'll find a lot of spicy salads and meat dishes that you won't find in a typical Thai restaurant in the city. The perfect place to go if you're into spicy food (but in case you're not, they ask if spicy is ok when you order). A nice cozy, casual feel that pairs well with the food, and a mix of communal and private tables. I'd even venture to say this might be one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Especially recommend the spicy duck salad!", "Came for dinner with G, who recently visited Thailand, and he attested to the authenticity of his dish (larb ped = spicy minced duck salad with green vegetables and chilis) and the spices used in our dishes. We started with an order of Moo Rong Hai Der and Khao Ji (= grilled marinated pork) which came with 2 sticks of sticky rice. The sticky rice is amazing - easily my favorite part of the meal and must order side (both bc its delicious and you likely will need it bc the dishes here are so spicy!). I wasn't feeling as adventurous and ordered the Kuay Tieo Pad See Eiw Talay (broad flat noodles with shrimp & calamari) - a little too oily for me, will probably order one of their spicy salads next time. Everything was delicious but very spicy, so if you're more of a \"medium spice\" person like me, definitely ask them to tone down the dishes for you (pretty sure we ordered the larb ped medium spicy and I still needed a ton of sticky rice/water). The portions are a bit small but filling. Cute decor, could probably seat two big groups comfortably in the center of the restaurant, with smaller tables meant for parties of 2 or 4 along the perimeter.", "I haven't had Thai food in Manhattan in years.

It IS spicy though so order with caution, you can get it mild too.\n\nI sat by the bar where the salad chef does his magic. He has a large mortar and pestle at his station with jars of ingredients.

We got the special veggie combo which comes with many small vegetarian sides including veggies and lentils. For the entree we got lamb stew ($14.99) which is soooo flavorful and very similar to Indian style lamb which is what I'm more familiar with. The veggie platter comes laid out on Injera which is the Ethiopian flat bread while the lamb came with a side of it. I've never had injera before but it was so incredibly soft and moist.\n\nOverall this meal was fantastic! Prices are reasonable and potions are pretty big and shareable.

This restaurant is small and cozy and the service was excellent.  I came with two co-workers and we ordered the veggie platter (omg), yeg beg wat (goat stew-yum) and the grilled beef (also yum).  Two of us were pretty big eaters but we still had a bit left over.  Like what most have said already, the veggie plate was really good.  It's fun going to each pile and trying to figure out which is your favorite.  Mine were the collards and the spicy lentil. Both the goat the beef were incredibly tender and you get a nice portion size.  Just keep in mind that it's 3 separate dishes so it's best to come with some people so you can cover all basis.  Also, the St. George beer was typical of a light beer but the honey wine was really interesting.  It came out looking like a mimosa and has a really unique taste.

Our group of four ordered the beef tartare with lotus chips, kimchi jeon, sweet potato, 3 sides (cucumber, brussels sprouts and lotus root), seared branzino, kimchi stew, and the ssam board.\n\nIf I HAD to choose, the standouts were the beef tartare and fried branzino. The beef tartare had awesome spice from the gochujang, balanced by sweet sugar and nutty pine nuts. The seared branzino was fork tender, served on a bed of fried fish and braised korean radish.\n\nTruly elevated Korean cuisine without sacrificing the umami or the explosive flavors.\n\nCannot wait to come back!!", "Reservations for this restaurant weren't easy to come by and I see why. Everything we had was absolutely delicious. Our server Natasha was amazing. From the time I entered to the time I left the entire staff was so pleasant it was such a breath of fresh air. For the appetizer we had the Tornado Potato (anju salt blend, furikake, citrus aioli) & Mandu (pan-fried pork & kimchi dumplings) You also get complimentary house kimchi  they definitely could have brought us two with no complaints from us. For the Main we had Saengsun Gui (pan-fried branzino, braised korean radish, soy garlic sauce) it was incredible & Dak Jjim (korean chili-braised chicken thighs, potatoes, and onion) I'm looking forward to returning, the experience was more than satisfying and there's so many other things on the menu that I would like to try.", "Anju! One of the only Korean Restaurants in DC has award winning chefs serving up hot and traditional Korean dishes. What else is there you need to know other than they deserve a 5 star review.\n\nService is great. Even with covid they have patio seating which is limited so you have to make a reservation! They offer take out too.\n\nThe food is high end and high quality but still feels  like your grandmas traditional recipes. Basically the vibes are comforting and the flavors are inviting.\n\nThey serve Korean Classics with a twist. Chef Angel definitely knows how to infuse all the flavors to make it his own.\n\nBrunch items is one of my faves including the Breakfast Juk which is a rice porridge with fried shrimp and roasted corn. They also have a HUGE spicy fried chikin sandwich that's been fried to perfection. The most delicious French toast has been stuffed with sweet potato and cream cheese!\n\nCheck them out if your looking for Korean food because this is it!", "After over a year and a half of the pandemic I had my first indoor dinner with friends at ANJU and it was a lovely space for a small group dinner. The restaurant is at the foot of 18th St and blessedly is removed from the frattier feel of further up 18th.\n\nThe menu is meant to be enjoyed family style and so we tried quite a few items from the menu. I lament that we didn't do the price fixed option which was very reasonably priced at $65/person. We all loved the impossible meat mandu which had the most delicious crunchy, spicy seasoning on top. We also enjoyed their citrus soju and look forward to trying one of the cocktails when we return.\n\nGlad to have tried this DC staple.", "So great! All the social media posts and reviews are true. Anju is off to a great start and looking forward to adding this restaurant to my list of frequented locations. I suggest you start with the appetizers and go from there as the serving sizes are generous (depending on how hungry you are). The kimchi jeon pancakes were delicious with the sauce they provided, mandu was perfect and not greasy, we got a half order of Chikin and it was to die for.  I ordered the bibimbap and was a little bit disappointed since it was not very special and a little overpriced. Will definitely return to try other dishes though!\n\nIn terms of reservations, the place gets packed quick. We arrived without one but were lucky enough that within minutes the hostess found a spot at the communal table on the first floor.", "I'm not sure I'd pay to have dinner here, but it's absolutely the perfect happy hour spot. A short walk from downtown, Anju has a fun atmosphere and a cheap drink and appetizer menu at happy hour. The crowd is lively, and there's a nice selection. We ordered a series of Asian beers, the spicy fried chicken, and the kimchi slaw dog before heading to our dinner spot. The food was outstanding and we had a lot of fun. We'll definitely be back!", "Kimchi Jjigae (delivery) - Overall, the taste is fantastic: great balance of salts, acids, and fat from the kimchi and pork belly. Tofu is the right kind used in Korean dishes, melt-in-your-mouth and light. You can really taste the meat permeate in the broth which I enjoyed.\n\nThe -1 star comes from the portion. I finished my rice halfway through the stew. They need to give more rice with this dish as 1) the stew is too salty without being balanced by carbs and 2) rice is cheap.\n\nThere aren't many restaurants focused on traditional korean recipes in DC, so I'm glad that Anju came in with a modern twist to it.", "My boyfriend and I loved anju! The food was delicious and the space was SO cute. We split the beef tartare, the half chicken, and the dak jjim. Everything was amazing and the portions were huge! We ended up taking home quite a bit of food. We will definitely be back!!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/anju-washington?hrid=g99W0rJaMFshCDj3qQm3gg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/anju-washington?hrid=8hmAIinuwiGrOpu3dfbRxg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/anju-washington?hrid=7awBsCC9D2gywjS63S5fSg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/anju-washington?hrid=oNeFbxuQuzrX1IXxAHl15g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/anju-washington?hrid=gJH_Tzo2jduxUWiZRGoL0A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/anju-washington?hrid=BaEyTnAyCOzKa1Pgd0BRfA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/anju-washington?hrid=z9LQUw1ZhX5Cyn1EeHWpoA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/anju-washington?hrid=QjWEKiuhUESNAUKz-UZHtA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Frenchette", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/frenchette-new-york-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/frenchette", "michelin_pov": "Zinc bar, marble floors, burgundy leather banquettes\u2014it\u2019s textbook brasserie with a smattering of art deco finesse.

Begin with brouillade, a plate filled with scrambled eggs framing a pool of Peconic snails and\u2014you guessed it\u2014garlic butter. Traditional sweetbreads sport a crisp shell masking the smooth interior and are served in a savory jus studded with poached crayfish and spring peas. Savor a flaky mille feuille before bidding this delightful kitchen adieu.\nThe wine list is a thoughtful collection of affordable natural European wines.", "yelp_reviews": ["I was so taken by the smart, elegant interior of this place that I almost immediately asked about it. I assumed it was an old bar from the 30's or 50's. I was shocked to be told that the entire space was gutted prior to the opening of Frenchette. It is a pleasure to dine in these surroundings.\n\nBrouillade is an amazing dish I never experienced. Eggs are soft scrambled and topped with escargot. It reminded me of a polenta appetizer if this were an Italian restaurant. The Ris de Veau ) were perfectly prepared with a touch of darkness at the surface. The Sweetbreads were served with crawfish, sorrel Mushroom slices and fava (?)beans.   A passion fruit Creme Souffl\u00e9 for dessert was flawless. Light, citric and sweet in every bite.\n\nThis is a bustling spot. Despite that, the food was great and the people are quietly friendly all surrounded by a beautiful bar and dining room. All of this makes for a fabulous evening of food.", "The only reason I gave Frenchette 2 stars is because most of the staff were pleasant and helpful. Otherwise I would have given it one star. Owners Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson have spent much of their careers working with Keith McNally, but it doesn't appear that his lessons have rubbed off. McNally made his mark creating faux French bistros that follow the script more faithfully than the originals. His inspired insight was to pair good - and importantly, consistently good - classic bistro dishes with a buzzy room. Frenchette fails on both fronts. The food falls on a spectrum from AWFUL to just barely acceptable. The tagine was terrible, the blowfish tails and the poulet roti are pretty bad, and the beef tartare is done better pretty much everywhere else. We didn't want to risk dessert. And the room is neither buzzy nor pretty. And finally, Frenchette is more expensive than other bistros that deliver a better experience.\n\nEvery McNally restaurant is better than Frenchette, and several other bistros are better as well (try Boucherie). I will say that the restaurant has a decent, relatively well priced wine list with some really interesting offerings. But overall Frenchette is to be avoided.", "Though there's nary a baguette at the famous Frenchette, there's still plenty that'll meet your palette! Lucky for you, that's all the rhyming I've got in me.\n\nAtmosphere: the dining room has an old-school brasserie aesthetic. Next time I'd opt for the bar area, where the art deco style is more prominent/interesting.\n\nFood: thankfully, the menu is more adventurous than your standard brasserie fare.Unfortunately, the only real highlights food-wise were the blowfish tails (perfectly spiced and not too oily) and frites. The duck was just okay: the skin was solid but TBH I prefer the duck in Chinatown! Escargot with soft scrambled eggs was too one-note for our tastes.\n\nWine: the NATURAL WINE list is CLUTCH, filled with funky gems. Lots of skin contact, if you know what I mean.", "I can't speak let alone write intelligently enough to convey the joy I experience when eating Chef Riad's food.\nIt's simply the best I've ever eaten. Every course is conceived of and prepared with love, skill, quality and brilliance.\n\nThe place is so comfortable and well laid out, beautifully appointed and designed- it's kind of a mid 70s Parisian vibe with Deco finishes and classic lines.\n\nThe servers and waitstaff are top notch and all seem very happy and industrious. I was able to sample so much of the menu, I ate too much, but every bite is a new flavor experience. Tortellini and Mussels Escabeche were highlights as well as the Gnocchi, the Steak, the Duck, the Lobster!! They made my stay in NYC so memorable and lovely. If you can get reservations do so. It truly a gastronomical delight.", "I really wanted to love Frenchette.  I really did - but  unfortunately I just felt let down.  The place was pretty and my drink at the bar was perfect but it went downhill  from there.  My friend came and we sat down.  She ordered a dirty martini with olives and the drink came with one tiny olive on a toothpick.  Then they brought some bread which was crusty and good but the butter was sour.  I ordered the Brouillade (basically scrambled eggs made with garlic butter and topped with a few escargots which was $26) and the PetIte Salad (which was a small bowl of lettuce lightly dressed in a Sherry vinaigrette for $16).  Both were bland.  My friend ordered the monkfish - which was tasteless.  She sent it back for the duck which she would have needed a saw to cut.  That went back as well.  It was a very memorable meal, but not in a good way. So disappointing.  As an aside, our waiter was fantastic and I felt really badly for him.  2 stars.  One for our waiter and one for the bread.", "Frenchette is the rare NYC restaurant that has stood the test of time -- part of the bedrock of the city's food scene for as long as I can remember. Since it opened this spring to rave reviews, Hamburger has wanted to know what the fuss was all about.\n\nYou should know the place serves cow brain. My roommates know that well. All too well. I waited to write this review until after I'd tricked them into eating a doggie bag of it. It \"tastes weird\" like \"Mac and cheese\" that is \"gross\" and \"dude, throw that away.\" I left it on the counter overnight to test if, like a fine wine, it improves over time. No.\n\nSomehow it was the second strangest thing on our table, after the fried whiting, but cocktails and the brouillade (egg souffl\u00e9 thing with escargot (SNALE)) and scallops and duck frites were very good. Overall solid four stars but as a Yelp Elite critic I wasn't, like, super impressed.", "Frenchette is a breath of fresh air.

Coveted for its fantastic cooking (check the front window for a slew of accolades), the menu also has a Cantonese focus. Service is basic and the d\u00e9cor kitschy at best, but it\u2019s clean, tidy, and tons of fun.\nWhile the massive menu touts everything from Dungeness crab to dim sum, it's really all about the congee here. Ladled into a clay pot with bits of crispy roasted duck skin, mingled with pork liver and white fish, or ramped up with blue crab and lobster, there are nearly 30 varieties of the soothing namesake porridge on offer. Pair it with dunkable sticks of puffy deep-fried Chinese crullers for a satisfying contrast in texture.", "yelp_reviews": ["I love Congee Village. It's one of those unique chinese food experiences that you can get in NYC. The atmosphere is like stepping into a remote chinese \"village\" with all the laquered wood etc. And the strange food items (duck tongue, jellyfish etc) to standard regular chinese food (Orange chicken, Lobster etc) offer a good variety of different textures and tastes for any palate. I highly reccomend the roast chicken. Their roast chicken is the best chicken you will have anywhere. Perfectly cooked, moist and the skin is crispy. Their congees are top notch as well. Not everything is great as the menu is really large and it's hard to have quality on everything when there is too many dishes to create, but there are a lot of gems on the menu. It will take many trips to try everything. The restaurant is very popular and expect a bit of a wait if you don't have reservations", "Best sick day remedy. Or just any day remedy really.\n\nThe thing I love about Congee Village is that you can go with a small group of friends and grab a bite for $5 a piece or go all out banquet style and get $20 worth of food. Regardless, Congee Village serves it all and I've never left feeling unsatisfied.\n\nTheir namesake is my favorite on the menu. Congee is a traditional Chinese dish made from rice and has a soupy starchy texture similar to porridge. Their list of add-ins is very long, including all types of meats, preserved veggies, thousand year egg, and more. My favorite is the pork, chicken, and duck.\n\nTheir main course dishes I like include pan fried bean curd and roast duck. To be honest, I almost always go with congee because it's such a good deal and delicious, but I don't complain if the tables wants to go for larger family style fare.\n\nIf you come on Saturday nights, be prepared for a wait. I also suggest this place if you're looking for a brunch alternative and don't want dim sum.", "Really solid restaurant in its category. Food is always spot on. Don't order the usual suspects that you might at some regular Chinatown place. Go for good, stick to your bones Canto fare like chicken cooked with shiitake in a box, rice with crab cooked in squash, dreamy creamy congee with fish or chicken, or if you are feeling fancy feast on the Long Island sound deep water dungeness (meatiest crab I've ever had!) I've always had attentive service. I smile, say thank you and leave a good tip. Friendliness begets friendliness. Also I'd do a bit of research before writing off waiters. In Asia waiters and help staff don't act like your servants. Just ask them for what you need and be nice. They'll always help out. I love the people here and the food is so good. Great for groups!", "Congee Village seems to love its reviews; they're plastered all over the windows. I was walking towards Chinatown when the flashy blue sign caught my eye. It was a cold day, and new as I am to the city, a bowl of hot congee would be perfect for bringing me back home.\n\nThe decor--tacky. Chinese restaurants don't need to have fake bamboo. But it's not like I ever evaluate ethnic restaurants on decor. On a sidetrip to the bathroom, I realized how big the restaurant actually is. Besides the more casual dining room in the front, the back had much more seating. Even better, the basement had door after door leading to private banquet rooms.\n\nOrdering the abalone chicken congee and a scallion pancake, I didn't realize how starchy my meal was until I was halfway through the bowl. The congee came in clay pots, something I can appreciate for keeping rice porridge hot. The flavors were all there; the ginger, the scallions, the abalone, the chicken. They all greeted me like I haven't visited in years.\n\nBetter yet, the congee is only like $4. Now that's how I really evaluate a Chinese restaurant!", "Congee is always delicious and service is OK, nothing to write home about.  The  Singapore Mei fun, Seafood casserole, and pan fried beef with Chinese broccoli are overly too sweet for my taste.  I mean don't get me wrong. The place is known for it's Congee and that is what they are good at. The other dishes are mediocre at best. So if you want great Congee, this is the place, if you want great tasty Cantonese food, try the other joints around Chinatown. Another thing that bothered me and made me hysterical laughing, 1st the temperature of the food in the seafood casserole dish was inconsistent throughout the dish. The fried tofu and broccoli were barely warm and the scallops were hot. When you rush the quality of the product suffers. secondly, they had this server who brought out the food he sounded just like \"froggy\" from \"The little rascals\" It was hysterical when he announced the dish as it approached our table in a grumpy monotone voice, complete with a sneer and stare down, priceless!", "\"A-Ok, \" 3-stars good.\n\nWhen this place first opened up, I had an urge just to dislike this place even without trying it.  Perhaps it was the cheaply themed storefront, or because it was located at the very edge of Chinatown and not deserving full Chinatown status, I don't really know.\n\nMy first time to patron this spot, I was very surprised that they offered more than just congee.  My party booked up four banquet tables and ate decent Cantonese fine dining dishes.  They even had abalone dishes.  Oh yes, they have congee too.  I was shocked and enlighten.  I've been open to dining here ever since.\n\nThe decor is still cheap, and free street parking is nearly non-existent without a healthy cardio walk.\n\nService is okay, nothing fantastic.  Most servers know enough English to get our order through, and it helps that I can speak broken Cantonese.\n\nThe prices are fair and comparable to other Chinatown equivalents.

My son doesn't typically like tacos but he was raving about it saying the pork was super tender and juicy. We also ordered the ceviche and that was super unique with complex flavors. It was really tasty. The foods all had a tanginess and spice to them which I loved. If you are not into spicy foods, make sure to ask for sauces and salsas on the side. Everything was very fresh and homemade.  The chef, Alex, was so friendly and welcoming. This place is definitely worth visiting!", "Pretty good taco spot. The best part is definitely the fire pit. You can sit outside in the back of the restaurant and eat a warm juicy carne asada taco as you look up at the stars and feel the warmth of the fire pit. The decor is very rustic, with picnic tables and sandy gravel on the ground, and no lighting in the back, and so it literally  feels like you are at a camp spot in yosemite.

Its interior is simple and friendly servers warm up the vibe. Tables are equipped with grills, but you\u2019re not required to work too hard, as waiters appear at just the right time to flip or slice the meat. Pork, chicken and shrimp are on offer, but prime beef, as seen in mouthwatering bulgogi, is your best bet. While their pricier American Wagyu is always worth the splurge, the acclaimed garlic-soy-brown sugar marinade is ace with short ribs. Still, you may want to avoid too much of a good thing by balancing it with cuts of non-marinated meat.\nLunch specials are easier on the wallet, offer great variety and are very popular.", "yelp_reviews": ["Really great Korean bbq. Like top notch.\n\nThe quality of the meats are really undeniable. They also offer the impressive wagyu beef if you're willing to pay for it. We didn't order that but we did get the ribeye, beef tongue, marinate short ribs and tiger shrimp. Everything was really delicious. The tongue was sliced very thin, the short ribs were just the right amount of fat, the shrimp were some of the best shrimp I've had at a Korean bbq place.  We also had the shrimp pancake and it was awesome too.\n\nThe prices were a little high in my opinion, though they make up for that a little bit with the $2 valet parking.  Their menu says that each person must order one bbq dish which is a lot of food. And what if you want to try something other than bbq?  I'm really against restaurants mandating how you should order.\n\nThey take reservations and I would recommend that you make resys if you don't want to wait 30+ minutes for a table. Service is prompt and efficient. They'lol come by and turn your meat over for you if you're not familiar with how to do Korean bbq.\n\nNext time I'm in town, I would stop by here again, but I may want to try some of the noodle or rice dishes.", "OK so it's pretty damn good. I tried one of the wagyu meats (W1 on the menu), the short ribs, and the tongue. The waitress recommended 2 for 2 people but we added on a third and we probably could have eaten a fourth if I was with one of my big-eating friends. The meat is fatty and the marinades flavorful. The sauce and the salt on the side are great for the non-marinated meats. The banchan are done well, although there aren't that many. Service is pretty good. The servers were really attentive about cooking the meat and changing the grill, but I had to keep asking for water and lettuce. They also brought the check before we were finished without asking if we wanted any more food, which we in fact did. I ordered the mint gelato with chocolate shell for dessert, which was also good, but not great.\n\nHOWEVER, as much as I liked the food, it was not, in my opinion worth the $93 (including tax and tap) that I paid for it. Meat quality just doesn't make as much of a difference at KBBQ as it does at a steakhouse. Definitely a must try for KBBQ lovers, but not a place I could see myself being a regular at.", "I have been here a few times but I forgot about how top end the quality of meat is that you get at this place. Usually when you think of Korean barbecue, you think of all you can eat spots. This has a couple of packages for me but it's not all you can eat. I would say this is the high-end version of Korean barbecue\n\nThey start off with all the usual sides that you would get a Korean barbecue but you can tell the quality difference versus the all you can eat places.. There is three types of kimchi and various things that come with the meal. We get the package deal and it's always more than enough\n\nSo trust me and start with the ggot sal (wagyu), then the pork belly, then bulgogi, then finish off with the galbi! You won't be disappointed at all\n\nThe food is definitely five stars but the service gets a point off because they are slow to the table and usually you said about 5 to 10 minutes before anybody comes. It always happens! One thing I do like is they come and cut up the meat and flip it for you so you enjoy your meal without having to do much work", "Being lauded as one of the top Korean BBQ joints in LA's Koreatown, I was stoked to finally try the charred, meaty goodness.  Inside, the decor's straight forward with ample ventilation for all the table grills.  The space is somewhat cramped though.  A perusal of the didn't take long as my friend and I quickly settled on some Park's galbi and prime ggot sal.  While they were both quite good and nicely marinated, I really can't say they're worth the (very) steep prices.  Compared to Genwa as an example, I actually enjoyed theirs a bit more.\n\nOn the other hand, the stone pot octopus casserole came piping hot and most generously portioned for $25.  Rich, hearty and loaded with spice, the mix of octopus, veggies, rice cakes and udon was very tasty and a nice contrast from the BBQ.\n\nRegarding the banchan, the selection was on the smaller side though each one was certainly well above average in taste.  As for service, our servers were decently attentive though I did find myself having to take the meat off the grill myself to avoid overcooking.\n\nFor the price, I've been to other places that either offer comparable if not better meats or a better atmosphere...or both.  Worth at one least try, but I don't foresee a return visit.", "We came here for the lunch special and was not disappointed!\n\nThis place is already super popular but there's a reason for it. Their lunch specials are really affordable considering the amount of food they give you.\n\nThe employees are very friendly and attentive, despite it being so busy!\n\nThey offer valet but there's also quite a bit of street\nparking so whatever you're comfortable with!\n\nWill be back for more :)", "Very good but too bad parking!

Been here twice already for lunch and have enjoyed my plates with every bite. If I could lick my plate, I might...except that my sandwiches don't really drip sauce or anything. Every sandwich I've had here has been great. I've tried the B.E.L.T and two other sandwiches I can't remember the names of (one had tofu and the other was a special).. But ALL GOOD. Love the chips they serve with the sandwiches too.\n\nIf it's hot out, I'd suggest ordering a beverage.....The water is tap and you can't smell/taste it and whether you get it cold or room temp is just hit or miss. One thing about this place though...although it's called Community Food & Juice, the juice selection is pretty minimal. I was expected smoothies, juices, and the like. Had to settle for a GuS (Grown Up Soda). Not too impressed.\n\nIt's not very wallet-friendly but NY as a whole isn't wallet-friendly..So put on the same scale, the price is average.\n\nIf people are visiting from California, I'd bring them here. Clean and good. Face it, no one from California wants to eat in a dirty resto...", "Community is owned by the same people as Clinton St Baking Co., however the quality of the food served here does not compare at all.\n\nI've been here a few times, mostly for brunch since I think that's kind of their forte. I've had the blueberry pancakes, veggie scramble and smoked salmon benedict, all of which are similar to some of the menu items at their original LES post. The blueberry pancakes are served almost exactly like the downtown location, with warm maple butter, but the consistency and flavor of the pancakes are very much different. I find the pancakes served here to be much less fluffy and tender, and somewhat lacking in the amount of wild maine blueberries they actually put in the batter. The veggie scramble and benedict are also just standards, not unlike what you'd find at most American restaurants. The whole wheat biscuit served here also pales in comparison to the ones at Clinton St, a bit tough and too crumbly for my liking.\n\nCommunity may be a good option for Morningside Heights, especially for fresh American fare. However, if you want to experience the \"famous\" blueberry pancakes by Neil Kleinberg and his wife and partner, make the trip downtown!", "Part of the joy of being a Columbia student is rolling into Community food and juice on the weekend for brunch. Community is a family owned establishment (also owns a few spots on Broadway such as Nussbaum, Brad's etc) and when you go, they treat you like family.\n\nFor brunch, my absolute favorite dish is the blueberry pancakes. Stacks of fluffy, uber soft pancakes with a slab of melted butter on top. Each bite is enhanced with an explosion of ripe blueberries. There is no other word to describe this but heavenly.\n\nAnother go to dish I have is the salmon eggs benedict. This can get pricey, but it is worth every penny. The eggs are perfectly poached and as soon as you cut into it, yolk spills out and soaks the English muffin and smoked salmon. The hollandaise sauce is not too heavy but provides ample taste.\n\nI do feel the fresh squeezed juices are too expensive. The small is $5, no refills, and the glass is certainly very small. But they are very fresh.\n\nDinner wise, the menu changes seasonally. During the fall, I love the pumpkin ravioli. The grass fed burger is always a solid choice and is available year round.\n\nTip: for brunch, go around 11 to skip the line.", "Tried the pan-seared fish sandwich (catch of the day fish), which came with beet chips. Everything was very crunchy (fish included), so definitely a good workout for your mandible, but well worth it.\n\nNot too loud, friendly staff, plentiful (but not too plentiful) seating on a weekday brunch, and strong enough coffee.", "I'm not really sure why this place doesn't have at least a 4-Star! I've been a couple times already now for brunch and have been surprised by how simple, and delicious the food was! Words cannot describe my love for hash brown. I was, at first, apprehensive about the carrot hash brown, but man, were they delicious. I'm just hoping that they are actually as healthy as they sound! Otherwise, I got the classic breakfast items like eggs and ham. The drinks were strong, but I agree with some of the other posters that they were on the more expensive side.", "We went in for light fare and had their potato pancakes, which were superb. When we asked for extra roasted apple sauce and sour cream, they brought them quickly. I had their kale salad with a substitute dressing. Very healthy, though a bit bland.

The real star of the brunch was the cocktail pitchers (we had the one with grapefruit) which were a hit with everyone.

I couldn't get over how much I enjoyed this dish\nTraditional chow mian with veggies - 5 stars for thick, tender, moist noodles with just enough flavor & the freshest mixed vegetables. Satisfied my craving for chow mein that hasn't been satisfied for years (why is good chow mein so hard to find?)\n\nIf you're craving Chinese or Szechuan or both, order from this place & be prepared to enjoy an exquisitely tasty meal :D", "I was happy that we were seated pretty shortly after we checked in with our reservation. I knew it would be busy as the Chinese New Year parade was happening that afternoon. The service here is pretty nice and quite different from most Asian restaurants. We ordered the Apple Wook Charcoal Grill Whole Fish dish as it is one of their specialties, and we got this with the Chinese Sour Pickle flavor. We also added mushrooms, noodles, and winter melon. We also got an eggplant dish as well. The only disappointing thing was that the fish seemed to be breaded and that was surprising. It was still good but not what we expected. The prices might be slightly higher than some spots but it just depends on how much people can eat.", "One of the best Chinese places I had eaten. Awesome. Chowmein sit fried was one of the best ones ever eaten. We ordered fish soup which was larger than expected but tasted very good.

If you frequent Ethiopian spots you know they're not known for quick service, and if you're the type to end up at a restaurant more than a little hungry, you understand how important quick service is.

My daughter got the shrimp tips I think it was called and she is not a spicy food fan but it was just a touch of spice and she loved it. They offer one dish of pasta with marinara and that's what she wanted to order. I'm glad she stepped out of her comfort zone. Everyone loved the food. My husband wasn't happy about the lack of forks but I guess that is how you are supposed to eat Ethiopian food. They give you rolls of the bread and you make like little tacos with it.

Not just speaking to their beautifully seasoned dishes, but (most importantly?) their injera: it is so fire every time. It's fluffy, thick, tangy, and chewy like no other injera you can find around here. Every time I return to Barcote after flirting with other Ethiopian spots, it's a beautiful reunion. \"This is what I've been missing!\"", "This place might just have the best Ethiopian food in all of Berkeley. We rented out Barcote's back room for a private event (college graduation celebration for my sister and her friends). The staff was super friendly and accommodating for us, checking in with us, getting us more food and water frequently, and helping us cut the graduation cake (yeah, they allowed outside food for the private event).\n\nThe food is delicious -- we ordered several vegetarian plates (it was an Indian graduation party) and a few meat plates. The quantities are large and diverse. The eating style, where everyone eats from the same large plate, brought together the 6 or 7 families who had never formally met before this. Our parents were basically old friends by the end of the night, thanks to Barcote.\n\nI definitely recommend coming here, especially if you want/need to host a private event.", "The service is excellent, and the vegetarian combo platter is delicious! They also have a gluten-free injeera option, and it was excellent as well. We ordered the two person veggie combo and could barely finish it even though we were super hungry.

It's been on both of our lists for a long time. The decors super cute. Sort of like a private bar feeling. When we got there, our waiter explained that Robin doesn't have a set menu.

What I didn't enjoy was the super tiny pieces of sushi which was no bigger than the size of my pinky. Was the food good? It was creative but I'm not sure it was that unique; I didn't have any piece that said wow this is the best sushi ever and I have to be back. Service at the restaurant is okay. It felt a little bit like that restaurant in the movie \"Date Night\" where Steve Carrell and Tina Fey go to.

It's a bit awkward from the get go, because they ask what price point you want to go for in front of everyone. Poor etiquette there. All in all the service was solid, the atmosphere was fun, but the sushi was not memorable. One bite at a time type situation. And felt it was overpriced for what you get. If you want a true omakase experience, go see Roger at Zushi Puzzle. You most likely will have to cut him off during the omakase from being overly stuffed, in a good way, for the same price point. Can't really recommend Robin unfortunately.

Fresh fish.  Good yelp reviews.  Anticipating an amazing meal...\nMEH, mediocre food.\n\nFails to impress, especially at a price point of $80-100pp omakase menu.  \nThe flavor combinations just don't work.  There was not a single piece that had a wow factor in taste.  \nThis is a modern omakase meal where sushi is dressed and embellished by other ingredients.  However, the embellishments fail to complement or enhance the flavor of the fish.\nThe live uni was delicious.  But you can get live uni at other great sushi restaurants too.  The flavor of the uni speaks for itself.  Not seeing the skill of the chef there.\nOne big underlying problem: Sushi rice is over seasoned and overdosed on vinegar.  \n\nService leaves room for improvement.  It was attentive, but lacks warmth or personal touch.  This feels like it should be a higher-end restaurant, so please have the service to match.\n\nMy take: Spend your omakase budget elsewhere for better culinary satisfaction.", "visits to date: 2\nfuture visits: hopefully many\n\nRound 1: we first dropped by robin back in August and was served/entertained by non other than owner/chef Adam Tortosa at the sushi bar.

It absolutely didn't make sense to have valet for a tiny parking lot like that. If it was an indoor parking lot I would understand but it's literally a 10 spot strip-mall lot. We pretty much just pull into a spot ourselves since the valet was parking another car when we showed up. It's a rip off to charge $5 for this so call valet parking.", "I adore this place. Let's get the only negative out of the way, which is that parking is a bit of a hassle. They have valet but a very small lot and on a busy night it can be a wait.\n\nOn to the pluses: Great, diverse menu of impeccably fresh seafood. Last time I had the steamed lobster, which is cooked perfectly and comes split with claws cracked to make eating it a breeze. Helen had a seafood pasta that was delicious. Good wine list with fair prices and a nice selection. Very good selection of craft beers. Amazing desserts. They will try to sell you the blondie but get the hot fudge sundae.\n\nVery friendly and knowledgable staff. None of the usual West Hollywood \"too cool for school\" attitude.\n\nReservations are strongly recommended but there is a nice bar if you want to risk it.", "Given the Hollywood location, one would expect a little too much trendy hipster, a little too much style, and not enough effort into the food. Particularly for the money.\n\nAnd indeed, it's not cheap...\n\nBut given the quality of the seafood, honestly, it's not bad. In fact, it's surprisingly good. The fried calamari is the only so-so item here, the Portuguese fish stew was excellent, fish and chips were quite good, and both the hot and the cold lobster rolls were superb. They may not stand up well outside of SoCal, but they were probably among the best ones I've had on the west coast.\n\nRaw oyster selection was adequate and more important, quite delicious. And the homemade ice creams, the huge blondie brownies, etc... beyond adequate, into delicious territory.\n\nService is quite decent, and if you have a large enough group that can get into the semi-private dining area, it's a lot more comfortable, a lot less noisy than the main area. The main area and patio fit the American seafood-house theme quite well, the whole thing just works.\n\nDoes it blow me away like some 5-star places? I'll be honest-- no. But the whole experience all wraps up so nicely, it feels well-deserved.", "Get the lobster roll. Hot. With butter. Weep with joy.\n\nI love this place. It has the feel of an east coast oyster shack with a little Los Angeles \"charm\" mixed in. The vibe is super relaxed and the wait staff is lovely. One thing to note: Getting in can be tricky. Make sure to get a reservation a few weeks in advance as the place still has the halo of being \"new\" news.\n\nAnd, don't forget to try the oysters!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/connie-and-teds-west-hollywood-2?hrid=daTWPN5F3UI4STWyv4akRA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/connie-and-teds-west-hollywood-2?hrid=u0p2nuvzBf-kpCtEdRa_7A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/connie-and-teds-west-hollywood-2?hrid=ojEKd4JNAjXlDZvYa0apvQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/connie-and-teds-west-hollywood-2?hrid=bzqCe3_WtJNHjf8x4AwJsw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/connie-and-teds-west-hollywood-2?hrid=favDVxhf3trqAVjb4ZOUQQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/connie-and-teds-west-hollywood-2?hrid=SEtEkflscX4Wtu0oNodg5w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "MAMA Oakland", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/mama-oakland-oakland/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/oakland/restaurant/mama-oakland", "michelin_pov": "Opened by a husband-and-wife team just a few doors down from their wine shop (Bay Grape), this alluring spot has that simple yet chic look down pat.

Staff was great, the owner explained the wines and pairings that would go well with what we were having and allowing us to taste before he poured, and the food was full of flavor and just comforting! The kids loved the pasta, my wife and I tried everything on the tasting menu and we loved it all.\n\nHow the menu works: 3 course dinner menu with two options to choose from in each course. There are other sides you can add for an additional cost. We decided to get the birote bread with anchovies and butter (good appetizer if you like the brininess of anchovies). After we had the three courses, we were perfectly full and happy, and opted to get a *six pack of beer for the kitchen, which acts as a cash tip to the back-of house staff. Menu items do change so check the website or call.\n\nPerfect for date night or a small family dinner.", "Loved this experience. We went early so got full attention. Fixed menu is simple and delicious. Choices were 1) a butternut squash soup or a salad with hazelnuts, celeriac, fennel & blood orange; 2) spaghetti with Mama's sugo or malfatti (similar to gnocchi) with roasted root vegetables; 3) pumpkin cheesecake or persimmon upside down cake. Between the 3 of us, we tried them all. We were not disappointed. Hubs is a pretty harsh critic of Italian food, having grown up in an Italian family / he raved about the spaghetti. The only sides we tried were bread (fresh & warm) & meatballs (again earning a big thumbs up from the hubs). Wine list was affordable & just big enough to make us feel like we had plenty of choices without being overwhelming.\nService was great / very friendly, & knowledgeable yet humble & unpretentious.", "Just a great dining experience. The staff was incredibly friendly and our waitress even took the time to explain to us how our sparkling rose was made in the same way that champagne is made. Very cool! and the rose was delicious.\n\nThen there was the food! It's a three course menu for a very reasonable price. There are two options for each course (appetizer, main, dessert). My wife and I decided to just order one of each so we could try it all. And let me tell you, there wasn't a single plate that disappointed. With each course, we had a hard time deciding which plate was better because all were excellent.\n\nWe live close by and are very excited to make this one of our regular spots!", "Went with a small group. Got to try all the options on the prefixe menu. Both pasta entrees were really good. I would def skip the first course and dessert if I could but then the entree itself isn't worth $30. Soup was bland and pretty basic. Salad was verrrry salty. Desserts both tasted days old. Id give it another try if both those courses were diff on the menu.\n\nWait service was good but first impression a bit weird cuz a couple of us arrived half hour early for our reservation hoping we could have a glass of wine at bar perhaps. There's a long counter which looked like it could serve just that purpose but the host said no. We also saw a table set for a party of 5 which we thought might be ours so we asked if we could sit and have a glass of wine but the host guy turned us away again. He directed us to their wine shop a few doors down and said he'd text when the table was ready. Half hour later, friends arrive and let us know they're seated. We never got a text from the host AND we ended up sitting at the table that we saw earlier which apparently WAS already set for us. I dunno why that happened like that.", "What a neighborhood gem! Love the affordable prix fixe menu with fresh pasta and starters inspired by the season. And the dessert was fantastic! Best olive oil cake I've had: very moist.\n\nAlso, the wine list is great, of course, and nicely balanced between classic and more trendy natural wines.\n\nThe decor is pretty unique: kind of a green theme, from indoor plants to green glass chandeliers. I like that it's not slick, it's just the tastes of the folks who opened it. Homey and vintage.\n\nExcellent service all around. The owner dropped by to say hi and offer wine suggestions, we were each offered tastes before each order of a glass of wine, and the waiters were very kind.\n\nThe bathroom also had some thoughtful details. A changing table, and a chair for nursing if you needed some quiet space. It felt very welcome to families.\n\nIt was also nice that they seat people until 10 pm on a Monday night! We added the optional \"6 pack\" for the kitchen, which is basically a small service fee that goes to the kitchen and dishwashers. Very grateful for their work.\n\nThe soundtrack was fun: some Lizzo, some neo-soul, but not so loud you couldn't have a nice conversation.\n\nExcited to go back!", "Such a great restaurant! I went here with my husband and another couple for dinner. I love the simple menu - three courses, with two choices for each course. No fuss! The first courses (salad or soup) were inventive, fresh, and delicious. The pasta course was very good, they always have the meat sugo option, and on this occasion has a puttanesca pasta as the other choice. The desserts were really marvelous too.

Yes, you can get an egg cream and Junior's cheesecake here.\n\nEven though there's a tiny parking lot next door, we prefer to travel here like Noo Yawkers - the restaurant is just around the corner from the CTA Red, Orange & Green Line stop at Roosevelt Rd. and a short walk from South Loop.  We live too far to dine here regularly, but we've managed to visit occasionally since its opening in 2006.\n\nWe love their breakfast/brunch items and the deli sandwiches and noshes, and we relish the old-school ambience and friendly service.  At busy times, though, the kitchen tends to get backed up and make mistakes.  There've been at least two occasions when we had to send back undercooked egg dishes.  On other visits they've neglected to heed special requests or forgotten to prepare a side dish.

But, I decided to enjoy myself anyway.\n\nI had the \"Woody Allen\" which is a double decker corned beef and pastrami sandwich. It comes with cole slaw and a pickle.

Though each dish is rooted in tradition, there's no shortage of flair, as in kampachi sashimi decked with the flavors of street corn.

It was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Much like Frontera, they manage to authentically represent the different regions of Mexico while creating upscale dishes. We were there for the \"art\" menu. The waiter did a great job explaining the theme and how it tied in to each course. I went with the recommended courses, while my wife tailored her courses. There was only one course she didn't like, but I did, so she gave that one to me. It's a small restaurant and pretty intimate. It definitely feels like you are in a special place as you walk they Frontera to get to a separate door for Topolobampo.\n\nWe saw Rick Bayless there...which was pretty cool since we're huge fans of his PBS show. He was also at Frontera when we were there a month earlier. What that says to us is he obviously is a hands on owner, despite the success and fame he's achieved.\n\nThis is definitely a special occasion restaurant that is very expensive. That said, we were there the night before it won the award as the best restaurant in the US...so I understand why they can charge those prices.", "The food: it is amazing. The carne asada was fork tender (chef recommends ordering medium-rare which is what I had). There was a depth to the flavor of every dish. The freshwater eel was a 5/5. Plates are small, but I was satisfied (not over satiated) when our meal was over.\n\nThe cocktails are really good with the same depth of flavor. A lot of smokiness to everything.\n\nThe service: the waitress was nice and attentive. She recommended and described our choices. The guys brining our food to the table described the sauces but they seemed so bored and spaced out as they were muttered the description. I don't blame them really. They have to repeat the same lines over and over every night.\n\nThe value: so this is a touchy subject. I value and appreciate good food. I can eat a $10 meal and be happy. So for $150 a person, is it worth it? I say pass, and go to Frontera. If you have the money, come here for an extra special evening.", "Outstanding meal. There are no words which can describe how truly amazing the food was. This is by far my favourite meal ever.\n\nWhen we arrived to the restaurant we were greeted and taken into Topolobampo through frontera grill, another of Bayless' restaurants. Once seated, a menu of three tasting options are presented.\n\nWhen the food arrives, it is truly an experience. Each dish is perfectly cooked, flavoured and authentically Mexican. After finishing the mains, dessert arrives. I was blown away by the flavour combination and Textures.\n\nThe service is unprecedented. New utensils are brought along with each new dish and the servers never miss a beat when something is needed.\n\nAfter the meal, you are given a goodie bag of homemade hot cocoa mix that can be used the next morning. It was creamy and rich and made the experience continue through to the next day.\n\nI would eat here every day if I could and I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.", "Mexican food is often reduced to the simple taco or burrito and not given much thought beyond that. The cuisine of Mexico proper, while appearing modest, is extremely complex in flavor, through the delicate use of chiles and spices. Topolobampo is an amazing restaurant in that it can take a humble (and exciting!) cuisine and turn it into something high-end and creative, all while maintaining the integrity of the original cuisine form. The staff was great here and the food was everything I wanted it to be, after waiting a good long time to be able to finally dine here. The tasting menus are well-thought out and composed and I highly recommend them to anyone who wants to get a good wide sampling of some really inventive Mexican food. I would return here again and again.", "Phenomenal experience.  Great tasting menu offering authentic Mexican cuisine, with an upscale twist.  The ceviche was so tasty and flavorful. The lamb served with mole was great as well.  Service was very courteous and accommodating.

Heck no, and frankly if I am spending that kind of money I am there to enjoy the whole experience. Yes, I went cheesy and had the Top Chef Masters menu. Hands down one of the best meals of my life to date. The layers of the flavor, the creative combinations, and the somelier rocked with the wine pairings. I could talk for hours about the Oaxacan (sp?) mole.\n\nThe service started a little shaky, but they got in the groove and redeemed themselves.\n\nFrontera has been an undoubtedly will remain on of my favorite restaurants.

The injera was definitely not as sour as I remembered another restaurant's injera was--not sure if that is a good or bad thing, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Everything was well seasoned and had deep flavors that went extremely well together. The pickled cabbage was a great balance for the meats and lentils.\n\nOverall, a great experience and would definitely come back again to enjoy a meal with friends!\n\nAlso, Georgetown restaurants are notoriously pricey, so don't be surprised when you get the bill!", "Overall a lovely dinner at Das! My party and I ordered the Das Chicken & Beef Combination Sampler, Das Vegetarian Entree Sampler, the Fish, and Potato salad. The Samplers were a good call because you get to try a handful of smaller portions of the entrees. My favorite was the fish and the beef cubes (from the sampler).\nI would say I was a bit disappointed with the wine choices - we tried the Sauvignon blanc and the Rose. The Rose was not something I would recommend, although the white wine choice was decent.\nYou get two rolls of injera, and if you need more you can get refills, although I wished you got a bit more at first. Only downside worth noting is that the entry level is the only one available right now and it's a tight fit, with tables very close together. Glad that we shared one large platter because that's all that can fit on the table (Maybe that is the point of small tables...) but I wouldn't recommend a larger party than 5-6 to eat here.\nOverall, yummy food and a good experience!", "Had a wonderful experience at this restaurant. When you walk in, you think you're in a super fancy elegant restuarant, but the prices are affordable.\n\nThe staff is very attentive and nice. They explained the dishes to us!\n\nEvery dish sounded delicious. I ended up going with the beef kay wat. A spicy beef stew with inerja (ethiopian flatbread) I loved how there were no utensils. When I try new cuisines, I want to immerse myself in its culture and have an authentic experience.\nI loved the inerja. It is soft and spongy and I used it to wrap my beef kay wat. I teared off a piece of inerja and then wrapped it. They kept refilling our inerja! I was incredibly stuffed.\n\nI love how colorful the food was - very appealing.  The food is just so flavorful and unique. All the different spices thay go into it! I also appreciated how they had a meat and a vegetable platter that sampled all the different options.

This is a perfect spot for adventurous eaters, as traditional Ethiopian is served family style and eaten without utensils; instead you are attentively supplied with a spongy bread utensil called Injera. Therefore, it makes for a fun dinner with a group of friends or on a second date to see how much fun he/she can have. To try as many of the bold and unique flavors as possible, the best option is to combine the Chicken and Beef sampler with the Vegetarian Entr\u00e9e sampler.", "Located on an unassuming corner at the edge of Georgetown, Das occupies a great space if you want to try out some of D.C.'s best Ethiopian cuisine.\n\nThe best part about the restaurant, besides the food, is the owner.

This personal touch extends to the knowledgeable waitstaff who will proactively refill your injera and drinks.\n\nI love ordering the meat and veggie platters since you get a nice mix of everything. Your carnivore friends can dig into the meat while your saving-the-planet veggie friends who also love HipCityVeg can enjoy their greens in peace. Everything here is tasty and filling, and you won't be disappointed with the flavors or spice levels. Nothing is overly spicy, although if you are sensitive, be aware that some of the individual dishes can reach the \"medium spice\" range.\n\nI've been here numerous times since I moved to the District, and it has never disappointed. Come with friends and family, and enjoy the genial atmosphere and fab food.", "More often than not, restaurant critics like myself jump to yelp and other sites to dish out our frustrations,  but this time, as I write my  experience, I can truly tell you that my mouth is watering just thinking about the dinner experience a group of us had at DAS Ethiopian Restaurant in Georgetown.  We had 11 adults and 6 children in our group.   The waiters were very attentive, and as the owner of the restaurant walked us through the menu, I can tell you that all of us were ready to dig in.  Our group got the Shrimp and Mushroom appetizers followed by a sampling of the beef, chicken, and veggie entrees to share.  Everything was delish complemented with Ethiopian beers and honey wine.  \n\nThe location is very nice and the restaurant gets quite busy in the evening.", "Good selection of vegetarian options with injera.

I had the mussels for an appetizer, and the lobster roll.  Mary's has good, classic seafood, but it has a slight gourmet twist - something different.  \n\nThe mussels were cooked in this broth that was just different.  I think it was topped with something that tasted like sauerkraut, but not as pungent.  Served with sourdough bread that was great for dipping.  \n\nThe lobster roll was $33 - kind of expensive.  But oh well.  It had a little more mayonnaise than I would have liked, but the lobster bits were thick, hearty, tender, and delicious with a squeeze of lemon juice.  I didn't think the lobster roll was small - it was just right.  Its more filling than you think.  And just overflowing with juicy lobster chunks!  More than enough for moi!  The fries were very slender and crispy.  I splashed them with a bit of vinegar and they were just perfect!  \n\nOn a Friday night, we got there at 8 and had to wait about an hour, but the servers and hostess were so friendly and apologetic about the wait.

We moved to Connecticut 12 years ago but still come into the city for dinner on most Saturday's.  Mary's draws us back over and over again.  Hard to find a restaurant as consistently excellent for so many years as this one!  The lobster roll is absolutely awesome and a MUST have!  If the salt-crusted shrimp is not on the menu, make sure to ask for it - the regulars know it and request it so they always have it , yum!  And do have the ice cream sundae with fudge sauce and peanut brittle to end your perfect meal!  They switch their menu seasonally and always in perfect balance with the seasons and what the fresh seafood market offers.  Absolutely awesome restaurant in a tiny, let-your-hair-down space.  Be prepared to wait a while in line a outdoors.  Worth it.  The line starts forming at 5:30 pm for the first seating at 6!", "Mary... you only did okay on this one.. and here's why:\n\nA bit overpriced... umm lobster roll for 30 buckeroos? Unless you are serving this thing on a platter made of solid platinum, you should not be charging that much for an average lobster roll drenched in mayo. I personally prefer less mayo, but mayo lovers might appreciate this one since the flavor overpowered much of the lobster. You get a choice between fries or salad on the side. We opted for fries, which were thread thin, flavorless and borderline overcooked (they did NOT look like the one in the pictures here). The portion size of the roll: average, I've had bigger... (that's what she said! HA!). We also had fried oysters, mini salted crab legs, braised octopus, and the cauliflower couscous... again.. small portion size, but everything was very good.\n\nOn the brighter side of things, service was fast and friendly. No need for reservations and we were seated promptly as we arrived fairly early (6pm-ish). The waitress offered suggestions and was very helpful. Atmosphere and ambiance was quaint. Overall a decent experience. Would I try it again? Probably not. There are other more conveniently located establishments to get my lobby roll fix for less. Thanks anyway!", "The Lobster Roll @ Mary's Fish Camp is really as good as everyone says it is!!  I went in there thinking, \"How good could it be?  It's just a Lobster Roll..\"  But one bite into the juicy, creamy, buttery, succulent lobster and all my pre-dispositions flew out the window.  It was soooo GOOD.  Served with thin cut Bay Fries, on top of the buttery-ist, toasty-ist hot dog bun I have ever tasted, was the most orgasmic, fresh, smorgasbord of lobster.  YUM-MY!  \n\nIf you haven't tried it and you like Lobster, you definitely have to try it out for yourself.  Not only is the food good, but the waitstaff is super friendly and unpretentious.  The Lobster roll is 25 bucks though and it isn't very big, so you might want to order some chowder or a hot fudge sundae to go with it.", "WHOA. I have been jonesing to go to this place forever. And, I am so happy I finally did. I will be coming back again and again and again.\n\nFirst, the place is tiny and super cute. You can smell the fresh seafood from a block away.\n\nWe got the lobster roll (best I have had), pan fried cod sandwich (too good) and skate (excellent with lemon/capers). The shoestring fries are addicting! The desserts are solid, nothing special, but good (had the sundae and lemon pudding).\n\nThe price isn't cheap but not bad either and very worth it.\n\nThis place is really my kind of place.

The small dining room had a consistent crowd and energy, full of many locals who obviously dine here all the time. The food all looked really tasty - we were able to try the shaved Brussels sprouts salad, the seared scallops and soba noodles, and the shrimp cake sandwich.

I actually had Pinch before jetting out to Seattle and having the actual Ding Tai Fung the day after so had a pretty good comparison.  I thought that the soup dumplings at Pinch are actually better!  They are more succulent and flavorful then at DTF.  Portion size is actually similar to DTF, which honestly is also kinda small.  The restaurant is in SOHO, so the price is actually pretty reasonable for that area (its the cheapest on the street).  (btw, DTF was also $10 for 6 dumplings).\n\nThe noodles are awesome, very chewy and flavorful.  The cumin ribs were delicious, and very tender.  I've also had the mushroom dumplings which were super umami flavored and enjoyable.\n\nThe decor is nice, and chic.  Bar has some serious wine selection and some interesting drinks.  The owner clearly spent a lot of time picking out good wines from all over the world.\n\nOverall very happy with the taste and selection of the food.  Understanding that it is in SOHO and all makes the price acceptable.  It's on the same level of service, and portion size as DTF, with better taste if you ask me.

Comes with 3 ribs\n- Pea shoots: always our vegetable of choice, and Pinch did not disappoint\n- Wind Sand chicken: our \"main\" entree of the night. I've never had such tender moist chicken before. We got this based on our waiter's recommendation. Everyone liked it but we all did not think it was worth the $50 price tag\n\nI'd come back here if I'm willing to splurge for dinner, but I also appreciate the cheaper options in Chinatown", "You walk in to a trendy, cozy space that gives an intimate vibe without an over-crowded on-top-of-you feeling.\nStaff was friendly and efficient.  Made suggestions on the menu and a constant, rotating number of people were resetting the table, clearing dishes, refilling waters, etc.\n\nIn terms of food, these were our picks, starting with our faves:\n1) Pork soup dumplings (absolutely delish with a few drops of soy and/or vinegar)\n2) Cumin Ribs (perfectly seasoned)\n3) Spicy Wontons\n4) Dan Dan Noodle\n5) Dong Po Pork Belly (order with a side of rice!)\n6) Vegetable Dumplings\n\nWe also tried sides of Taiwanese cabbage & pork as well as seasonal greens -- both perfectly al dente with a great crunch.\n\nI should mention that even though the food list is in descending order starting with our favorites, every bite of every dish was gobbled up immediately.  We were happy with every choice.\n\nWe particularly enjoyed that dishes were brought out in stages: as soon as we finished one, it was cleared, new table setting placed, and our next item arrived immediately yet somehow without feeling rushed.  Fun to feel like we were having a legitimate dining experience rather than simply filling up and turning the table.\n\nThe whole place was sparklingly clean including the bathrooms.\n\nFive stars.  Very much enjoyed.", "Pinch Chinese has a modern look and nice service. But this cannot balance out the fact that they bumped up the food price while the courses taste no superior.

It's a great place to visit if you like to appreciate simple ingredients.", "A good attempt at introducing the authentic dishes to match a modern taste. Our party of 7 dove into dumplings and ribs to kick things off. We had every order of dumpling flavor available, some twice, and the seafood and pork was the winner for me.\n\nThe mains were good, most notable dish were the pea shoots and duck. The duck is appropriately sliced into bite sized juicy hits of dark meat. You can only dream of snacking on these throughout the day. Okay I might be alone in that category. We also had a deliciously spicy ma po tofu, something I think goes great with - surprise! white rice.\n\nI would recommend this spot.", "I was skeptical at first, a Chinese place in SOHO?? But we gave it a try since we were in the neighborhood. We got pork soup dumplings, mushroom dumplings, spicy wontons, eggplant, and seafood fried rice.\n\nAll dim sum dishes were excellent. The wrap of the dumplings/wonton were skin-thin, which is always a good indicator of how good the dumplings are. Pork soup dumplings were not overly oily, which sometimes happens at other Chinese places. Mushroom dumplings were light and flavorful, and wontons tasted like homemade. I was very very happy with all of those dishes.\n\nThe others, not so much. Eggplants were a bit undercooked. I understand sometimes to keep the beautiful purple color of the eggplant skin, you don't want to overcook it, but ours was really undercooked. As a result, it was tasteless. The fried rice was average, something I can make at home. Not bad, not amazing.\n\nI'd highly recommend people to come here and try their dim sum dishes, maybe stay away from others?", "Pinch is a diamond of a restaurant.

Definitely get it with the garlic naan.", "I've really tried to like this place but fact is it's ridiculously overpriced and really really average at best. I'm a big fan of dal makhni made the authentic North Indian way--it's always a hit or miss with saffron...more miss lately. The dal is so thick and congealed esp. when ordering takeout that one look at it and you're done. I've tried the yellow dal but I found it too heavy (they use channa dal who  is a strange choice of yellow dal to begin with!). Their curries tend to taste the same whether it's mutton or fish.\nThe buffet is decent but as others mention just not worth the hefty price tag. Finally, today we ordered the veg dum biryani and it sealed the deal for us--never ever eating at saffron again. The dish was awful to put it mildly-- it was full of veggies with hardly any rice and way too much masala esp. whole masala. I couldn't go beyond two spoonfuls which is saying a lot since we paid $18 for that crap!\nNext time I'll just cook at home!", "My first time at this restaurant was a Sunday night. I was not aware that Sunday night dinners are buffet style. You could order from the menu, but the wait staff seemed to discouraged it by telling me it would take too long (approximately 20 minutes) to order. I was a little irritated that they would discourage it as I just wanted to try their lamb vindaloo. I didn't want to pay $22 for a buffet when I only wanted 1 dish. However, I decided to be adventurous and try the buffet.\n\nTo my surprise, the buffet was pleasantly good! There was a good selection of dishes to choose from: a few vegetarian dishes, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, chutneys, desserts, etc.\n\nThe butter chicken and lamb vindaloos were both flavorful and delicious. The staff was very diligent in replacing items that have ran out. The naan bread is brought hot and fresh to each table. While the food was very good, I don't feel like I ate $22 worth. Perhaps next time I will try take out.", "We stopped by here to grab a to-go order before heading back into the wild and wonky boondocks, far away from civilization (if civilization means Bloody Mary's and Indian food).\n\nThe waiter made it super simple by handing us a takeout menu and offering a cushioned bench by the door for us to sit on while we decided.\n\nI mainly paid attention to the vegetarian menu, so I'm not sure what meat options they have. But I was pleased to find a veggie-specific section, and was also impressed that they had a lot of unique offerings and spin-offs of traditional Indian fare.\n\nThe butternut squash curry has a lot of oil and a very mild taste. But there's a spicy aftershock that I liked. And the squash was perfect.\n\nThe game changer, though, is their white cheddar naan. That's right: white. Cheddar. Naan. With a spicy side of what I believe to be tikki masala sauce. It was divine. Probably the best naan I've ever had. I'll be back just for the naan alone.", "Four stars because this is the kind of place Yelp people would like and this is Yelp.\n\nI thank them for having a nightly dinner buffet, this is kinda rare.\n\nI consider this food the americanized semi-sweet, creamy and salty fare.  That is what lots of people like and so this review is for the people.\n\nIn short everything was perfectly fine, the place was clean, staff were nice very highly attentive, and all of the food was solidly what most people in the bay area associate as great Indian food.  The naan was particularly great IMO.\n\nIt's got the trendy modern updated thing going on, it is formal and the staff is there at every turn to do your bidding, so again I know Yelpers will love it.\n\nPersonally it is entirely not what I go for, especially for health reasons, I prefer to eat more like home-cooked Indian food, far less cream, sugar, but more spice, cooked very slowly over a long period.    \n\nParticularly the Butter Chicken was quite sweet, which many confuse for 'buttery' (sugar paired with cream has that sort of flavor) which one may think makes good sense given the name, but the name actually has to do with the chicken itself and its tenderness, not flavor of the gravy.", "Make reservations for lunch or you will wait a long time. Came here are on a Friday with co workers and man, did we go to town on the buffet! Butter and tandoori chicken were the only meat options, but that's ok. The curries were perfect for dipping with the naan bread and the flavors and spices spiced up my stomach in a good way :)\n\nI looked the deep fried kale and I devoured every curry they had. I went back for seconds then dessert which was probably a bad idea, but the food was so yummy!!! Good service, cannot complain. Price was a bit high than other buffets, but it's San Carlos and it's all you can eat. Not the best buffet I had, but still really good.\n\nOverall: Great food, Good price, Good service"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/saffron-san-carlos?hrid=UcJZEocw6g4vjOfgpu325w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/saffron-san-carlos?hrid=luHp9Q5d5h1-cpdDsfsc0A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/saffron-san-carlos?hrid=DWtM2-sWGxWl-4D0cjilTQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/saffron-san-carlos?hrid=Cvf1CyuBFn_puNKr-I7AZA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/saffron-san-carlos?hrid=U4T_LPMkfZUnCCpu9yJVsA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/saffron-san-carlos?hrid=pK-vaiKG-2M0CIXVtGsO7g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Chilam Balam", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/chilam-balam-chicago-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/illinois/chicago/restaurant/chilam-balam", "michelin_pov": "This cozy subterranean space feels like an undiscovered hideaway, but the secret is offcially out.

He immediately opened our bottle of red wine and poured our glasses and recommended his favorite dishes on their rotating menu (all with a quick wit, I might add).

We decided we'd had enough and didn't order any more.\n\nThe queso fundido was basically all peppers and a little sausage topped with a layer of cheese that looked and tasted like mozzarella. Boring and bland. It was the first time I ever left a portion of queso fundido unfinished. And this potion was pretty small.\n\nThe hangar steak was good, but the sauce it was in was pretty uninspired. At first, after the bland queso, it tasted too spicy. Then that quieted and it was just a nondescript sauce.\n\nI expected much better and for $22 for two mediocre small plates, I felt it wasn't a good value for the money.", "I visited Chilam Balam tonight for the first time and loved it! My friend had heard great things about the restaurant, and we decided to check it out.  The wait was 45 minutes when we arrived, but was well worth it.  They even took down our cell number, which gave us time to go to the ATM - the restaurant is CASH ONLY - and allowed us to walk around.  The ingredients are fresh and most are from local farms, so the menu changes each month. They recommended 2 plates per person.  We ordered:\n\nRoasted cauliflower (with chimichurri, jicama, pineapple, cucumber, mango) - it was good, but nothing amazing.  I was happy to eat it, but would probably order something else next time.\n\nGrilled salmon (with salsa veracruzana, wild rice) - very good, nothing extraordinary though.\n\nCorn masa memelas ( with black beans, aged goat cheese, arbol salsa and dressed shoots) - DELICIOUS! You could taste each ingredient, and the flavors complemented one another really well.\n\nGrilled vegetable succotash gorditas (with melting cheese, pasilla cream, pea shoots salad) - also delicious.

They have weekly specials, and you can't go wrong with any of the savory dishes They also make fun sort of breakfast appetizers, like hand pies and biscuits, and serve Dark Matter coffee. But I'm most enamored with Lula's dinner. I feel like meat almost always tastes good, but as a former vegetarian and lover of produce, I'm always impressed when a chef makes vegetables well. It's clear that the folks at Lula take great pains to source their produce and they cook it better than any restaurant in Chicago. They also serve a several course \"farm dinner\" on Monday nights which is really good.\n\nI've brought lots of people at Lula, including locals, out of town friends, my parents (who are a little older and don't eat out much).

Next was a soup course, braised cabbage, and dumplings. The dumplings might have been my favorite, but a bit too salty--especially after three heavily-seasoned, savory courses. Next was a tasty cheese course. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the dessert, butterscotch pudding--not a pudding fan, but seems like a weird way to end a tasting menu. Give me a light sorbet or give me a decadent cake/mouse, but the pudding was just kind of blah...Am I crazy? Pudding is boring, right?\n\nMy only other gripe was the pacing of the meal. The first three couple courses came out quickly, but the fourth course took like twenty minutes from the time we finished the previous. I'm down for a leisurely meal, but there was an obvious miscommunication between the server, kitchen and expeditor.", "Discovered the restaurant via a fundraiser gift card and went with another couple who've been wanting to try it.  Appetizers were unique - we had fresh spring asparagus/ricotta/poached egg, feta cheese with jalapeno/basil olive oil, and asparagus soup - all had great, fresh flavor. The soup was poured tableside and had a beautiful green color, perfect spring flavor. Entrees included the grilled pork chop with german potato salad gnochhi, flank steak. The gnochhi had a subtle german potato flavor and was not overpowering. Pork chop was good. My husband raved about the steak.\nFor dessert, although I'm a chocoholic, we had carrot cake. I did not regret it. Moist cake, and the cream cheese frosting was not too sweet. Rhubarb crumble was tempting. Great seasonal menu. Good vegetarian choices, too. Sangria was very good.

The interior decor was imported from a Chicago hotel (if I remember correctly) that was being demolished and it is exquisite from floor to ceiling! The menu was well rounded with several dishes to choose from that all sounded amazing. The wine list was so long that I think it weighed 5 lbs. While waiting for our food we were served soft bread and herbed bread sticks with a trio of olives, butter and a really good bean dip. I started with a cup of the famous abalone bisque which lived up to it's notoriety and then some. Following the soup came the amazing Salinas salad sprinkled in orange and red flower petals! It was a vision! My main entree was the lobster ravioli in cream sauce which was equally as tasty as the rest. My husband had a seafood rigatoni with pesto sauce which was top notch. You really can tell when a restaurant has a well trained chef. In addition, the service was timely and well done. What a pleasure the whole experience was. I would highly recommend this place for a fine dining experience.", "What an amazing restaurant! We expected a rustic place based on the name and the exterior, however, we were very impressed by the high end quality of the inside. There are several dining rooms and one rivaled many of the palaces of Europe. They also have an atrium diningroom that was beautiful!  Their wine collection is probably one of the largest of any restaurant on the west coast. They take their wines very seriously and if you have a special occasion their sommelier can pick out a fabulous bottle from their collection.  If you are lucky enough to get a wine cellar tour, you will feel like you are in Italy with the \"catacombs\" and iron gates they store their wines in. The food was very high quality and the service was excellent and the staff very accommodating. It was very evident that many of the locals are regulars at this place as they were greeted like old friends. Skip the touristy places by the water and treat yourself to an awesome dining experience at this place. We had been visiting Napa and San Francisco for several days and this dinner was a highlight of our trip. Thanks Sardine Factory!", "We came here on a Saturday and had reservations for about 14 of us. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. The place was exuding romance with dim lighting and white table cloths; we were in the glass room which looked out into a garden with white twinkling lights.\n\nThe menu looked delicious, with choices of different seafood and steak options. I decided to go with the Seafood and Pasta dish which came with fettuccini pasta, fish, clams & prawns, tomatoes, garlic in a marinara sauce for $39. It was pretty steep for a pasta dish in my opinion. It was good, but not great as there was a lot of left over fish in my pasta. I would've liked a bit more prawns or clams and more sauce. It was a large portion I must say and it could be easily shared. My friends ordered everything from the filet mignon and lobster. They all seemed pleased with their dishes and cleaned their plates. We also got one of their signature cocktails which was tasty and very strong!  Overall, the service was great and they were accommodating of our large group and being able to split the bill went smoothly.", "We made our way to the Sardine Factory. We were seated in an glass-domed atrium called the Conservatory that featured  a huge chandelier and a stature of Venus, a setting we imagined would look even better in the day, where you could see the vegetation outside. We passed a dining room called \"the Captain's Room\" that showcased old paintings of sea captains. The wine cellar was excellent. We started with six Hog Island oysters with malt vinegar, horse radish and cocktail sauce. We shared a tasting plate of sand dabs, Crab risotto, prawns and scallops. My wife had a bloody mary and we shared a Justin Cabernet. We finished it off with a dessert of Kahlua chocolate ice cream, chocolate wafers and chocolate mousse. Good service and overall experience..", "I did a business meal for 29 people here the other day and rented out \"the wine cellar.\"  While the service was good and they worked hard to make it fun, we had a number of concerns\n\n- It's kinda crowded and dungeony in the wine cellar.  While some might like it, with the 29-person maximum, it's tight and some folks were a bit claustrophobic.\n\n- The food is pricey for what it was.  \n\n- The food just wasn't that good.  I had the abalone bisque (good), the pear and arugula salad (ok, nothing to write home about), the poached lobster tail (kinda cold by the time I got it), and some dessert that I can't remember (never a good sign).\n\nOverall, it was kinda sorta fun.  Whole experience -- including the food -- just felt a bit dated.  To add insult to injury I had planned The Sardine Factory as the big celebratory night out for the team and The FishHopper the next evening as cheap, touristy dinner to balance the budget.  Amazingly, people enjoyed the The Fish Hopper *more*.  Ouch!  That's not supposed to happen when you compare The Sardine Factory to The Fish Hopper.", "This is a beautiful restaurant with a mix of excellent classic and progressive dishes.

They have a great selection of meats - cabeza, lengua, carnitas (with nice crispy edges), chochinita pibil, and the usual Pollo and Carne asada. They use good queso fresco for toppings and a healthy dose of pickled Chiles. I highly recommend the huaraches.

My partner and I had lunch here yesterday for the first time. We got a huarache con huevos y nopales, a quesadilla Azteca (three different vegetable fillings), and mochas. All of it was SO good. Even though the mochas made with a Nespresso machine, some additional specialness (including cinnamon) was added, and they were served in beautiful, colorful ceramic mugs.\n\nI also loved looking at the bright orange wall decorated with archetypal paintings celebrating symbols of Mexico's culture and history.

The quesadilla de flor de calabaza was ok. I suppose this is a favorite from Mexico City, not really for my taste buds. I want to try the huarache next time.

Luv2Eat is a completely unassuming mom-n-pop restaurant tucked into a Hollywood strip mall anchored by a 7-11.\n\nThe fish curry was amazing, though even mild proved to be too hot for some at our table. I was smartly told that it's the same flavor broth as their highly-touted crab curry, only a lot less work (you get the crab still in the legs/ and have to pick the meat out of the shells, but with the fish curry, chunks of white fish were floating in the broth...).\n\nWe also loved the crying tiger beef (sweet, not spicy at all), the fried pork and chinese broccoli, and the jade noodles -- al of which were fantastic.\n\nThe only thing I'd skip next time is the papaya salad. Usually, I love this as a go-to at a Thai restaurant, as it offers a little sweet, crunchy respite when on the plate with meat and rice...

So I now have the best of South and North.\n\nI ordered the pink milk which is essentially Hale's blue boy sala flavored syrup with milk. It's the childhood essence of every Thai child that went to Wat Thai on the weekends. Anyways, I'm not sure if they can offer it with sparkling soda but id sure ask. I would recommend you guys order it. It is sweet but very off setting for the spice in the entrees.\n\nThe papaya salad with the \"pa-la\" fishy goodness is quite authentic here. This place is very authentic. Aka can very much be too spicy. So mild isn't mild people.\n\nIt's such a little detail but sticky rice. Great consistency ! I hate dry/overly moist sticky rice.

The pork and shrimp dumplings, a highlight for me, were both delicate and chewy at the same time.  Not sure how they pull that off.  Left overs fried up nicely at home.

The mother was making the dumplings and the family members were the waiters and bus persons.  Delicious beef noodle soup, made with fresh broth and fresh noodles.  The star anise and Sichuan peppers accented the broth and soup.  We started with the marinated beef and the onion pancakes.

Usually, it is sweet and savory, with the sauce consisting of soy sauce, wine, and sugar as is common for Shanghainese cooking. The Hunan style, however, makes it slightly spicy and not sweet, which is very different but just as good. Spicy fish is a Szechuanese staple, and they do a good job of it with tender fish fillets and a well-balanced soup.

Well grilled mushroom. Good with green scallions. Mild and savory sauce. Assorted appetizers-delicious. My personal favorite is the homemade cheese. Almost tastes like butter. Very creamy and flavorful. Smooth texture. Marinated oyster is also super tender and flavorful. Baby mackerel is lightly fried and also tasty. Also includes marinated beef that tastes like prosciutto, crab cake, vegetables and chicken breast. Sukui tofu-good. Homemade plain tofu with different kinds of toppings. Japanese sweet tomato-delicious. Excellent quality of tomatoes. Fresh and naturally sweet. Surprisingly refreshing with the two sides of salt. Sansai kinoko soba-delicious. Soft homemade soba noodles that almost melt in your mouth. Excellent quality of vegetables, grated daikon and nameko mushroom. Mild and savory broth. Excellent service.", "As a vegetarian, there are enough options to choose from. I got the shishito peppers, tofu, and hot vegetarian soba. I think about 3 bites into the soba, I realized I do not like soba noodles-in general. The broth was delicious- good flavor without it being overwhelming or too spicy. The appetizers were also fantastic.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 the fried chicken and some skewers and he's definitely coming back.\n\nWorth checking out especially since I think it's a good price. $50 for 2 people, no drinks", "It has been a long time since I came to this restaurant last.  However, everyone in the family was quite happy finding variety of dishes.  This place is not just about soba.  It has quite extensive Yakitori menu, which is as good as what you would find in a yakitori place in Japan.  We ordered sashimi (raw fish) appetizer, which was quite delicious.  We ordered many kinds of yakitori (chicken) .  You can eat with the sauce or with salt, which means quite authentic.  They had various seafood items, veggies, meat on a skewers as well.\nThe sobas were fresh and innovative combination as well.\nWe were delighted and thus, we will return very soon.\nIt is a plus that it is a minute walk to Grand Central Station.", "Fantastic place.

We were so pleasantly surprised by the service and the amazing drinks/food they have to offer! We sat at the bar just wanting a drink or two. The bartenders were nice and chatted with us at times, even explaining some of the drinks they were making for other tables. They utilize \"salt air\" for some of their drinks. I would relate it to a salty foam at the top of a drink. Keeps things fun and a bit different. The decor is bright, vibrant and goes perfectly with the menu. They are mainly tapas food items. The size of the plates are small and order a few for multiple people at a table. The margaritas are amazing.\n\nThey also have homemade chips and salsa for the table but you need to request it. The first order of chips and salsa is on the house but after that -- you need to purchase them. They make homemade guacamole right in front of you and it's amazing! If you're in the area, absolutely don't miss out on trying this place! I know we'll be back. Make sure you get there with ample time for parking and a potential wait -- they can get crowded at times!", "This update is based on their Almuerzo Rapido menu.  I love this lunch menu, please don't ever change!  I am a huge fan of their sopa Tarasca estilo P\u00e1tzcuaro (black bean soup with avocado leaves, light Mexican cream and aged cotija cheese, served with a side of\ncrispy ancho chile, avocado and fried tortilla), taco de hongos con crema (saut\u00e9ed wild mushrooms with shallots and Mexican cream, topped with salsa serrano and pickled red onions), and pastel de tres leches con pi\u00f1a (traditional cake soaked in Coruba rum and three kinds of milk, with a rum and milk foam, fresh pineapple gelatin and a pineapple salsa, served with a scoop of dark caramel ice cream).

Make a reservation, even if for lunch, the place is always packed.", "Another winner from Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s. The menu consists of a small, sharable plates accompanied by a wonderful variety of margaritas. The highlights of our meal were the ahi tuna ceviche, pork belly quesadilla, braised beef tongue taco, and squash blossom special. Honestly, there is something for everyone on this menu. Service was attentive and prompt, yet not overbearing.\n\nWhat I appreciate most about Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s is the consistency of creativity and flavor he delivers in every one of his restaurants. Though people may enjoy one cuisine more than another, in visiting one of Chef Andr\u00e9s' restaurants you can always count on his signature style to shine through. The decor, ambiance, service, and, of course, food combine to create a unique and memorable experience every time.", "Delicious, fresh flavours. I seem to come here mostly after work, which begins as drinking and ends up with orders of food and sometimes tequila tastings.\n\nFirst off, their margaritas are good -- and cheap during happy hour, if overly small. They use fresh ingredients and not that neon-green mixer crap you get in lesser restaurants.\n\nGuacamole is made fresh at your table, with varying degrees of spiciness or flavour. I hate cilantro with the fire of a thousand suns, so I always go without. Otherwise, it's put in liberally. But the cilantro-free version is brilliant, and almost as good as Mom's.\n\nI love the small plates. I haven't tried any of the larger mains; I aim to go back and do that. I tend to get tacos, which is a big portion of the menu. Particular favourites are pork and chicken, and you have to get the grasshopper tacos. Yum.\n\nThere is a great tequila menu, as mentioned above. Some good sippin' tequilas that make for good after-dinner drinks.\n\nService, on the whole, is good. It gets quite busy, so sometimes your server might be hard to get a hold of, but generally they are responsive and courteous.\n\nDo note that it tends to be quite loud inside.", "I've been here twice - once for a tequila tasting and once for dinner. Loved the space for the tequila tasting and great food - all of the tables were removed and it was easy to walk around, drink, and nibble.\n\nSo, when we returned for dinner a few months later I was surprised at how packed in the place is! It feels very claustrophobic with all of the random decorations and crammed together tables. We were seated at a table for two close to the kitchen and every time servers walked past us with a tray I thought they were going to hit us in the head!\n\nAnyway. I would rate this place 3.5 stars but I'm bumping to 4 because we had really good, fast service. The food is fine but not great. We had the hamachi ceviche, quesadilla huitlacoche, ribs, shrimp, chicken taco and duck confit taco. Nothing mind blowing but everything was prepared well and had good seasoning. We each had one drink and the total before tip was around $85 - anytime we eat out in DC and it's under $100 it's a good deal to us!", "My favorite of the Jose Andreas restaurants.  I love the lunch special here - 3 courses for $20.  You can get either two tacos and an appetizer or an appetizer, taco and dessert.

You'll find it down an alley, sometimes lit with lanterns.\n\nI went to the Sovereign because it has one of the best beer lists in DC. Lots of obscure Belgian beers, and a great selection of sours, if you are into that kind of thing (which I very much am). There is a solid draft list, easily with 50 different drafts (I'm guessing) as well as a book full of bottles. In addition, there is a wine list and a cocktail list, but, I was too excited with the beer list to bother with those.\n\nThe bar is two stories, dimly lit, and full of large, exceedingly comfortable booths. Great for a romantic date night or a quiet evening with friends.\n\nOur server was knowledgeable about beer and very friendly. My friend got a few small plates and said they were very good too. It's not cheap (my friend got a $25 16oz beer), but, for what you are getting, I wouldn't expect it to be.", "Date night planning? Sovereign is your answer!\n\nSovereign is one of the top 3 restaurants in the Georgetown neighborhood for me. I highly suggest it! With its dark lit ambiance, this place is perfect for a first date, second date, hmm any date really. Because of the mood lighting, Sovereign is an easy place to have an intimate heart to heart. I've shared quite a few of these conversations at the bar over sips of beer from their extensive and constantly changing beer collection.\n\nIts not a sports bar, or a college bar, or anything like cookie-cutter tourist favorites like Clydes. Instead Sovereign almost reminds me of a tucked away speakeasy. That's why I love it; there is a lack of this type of bar in the neighborhood.\n\nOn to food, their loaded fries are a godsend. I never never order these fries when I dine here. Those fried bad boys paired with an icy beer is all you really need for your weekday evening after-work de-stress. All of the food Sovereign serves up is really tasty and rich, so live a little and try something new!\n\nUpstairs is a more casual bar setting, which is best for larger groups. If you're on a more romantic date, opt for downstairs. You won't regret it!", "My work team and I made reservations here this week and enjoyed a nice dinner. It was very easy to make a reservation, they called to confirm and they were fine when we were 30 minutes late. The beer selection was great (49 beers on draft and you can do small pours so you can try more). I tried the two sours they had on draft and really liked the red sour. We tried the saffron mussels, which were delicious. Also the croquettes, which were good (we liked the shrimp ones better). Two of us tried the rabbit, and although it could have been a little more tender and a little saltier, the sour cherry sauce was very good. The cod got rave reviews from our table. For dessert we tried a bunch of the ice cream options. Didn't really think the speculoos was anything special but the white coffee was really good. Overall good service if a little bit over the top. A bit expensive as well but I wasn't paying so I didn't mind :) The only thing I will say I didn't really like is how dark it was inside, especially on a nice day when you just want to be outside it was a bit of a turn off. Would probably come back for beers again with some of my other beer loving friends.", "This Georgetown establishment definitely caters to an older crowd with its dim lighting, rustic decor, and laid back ambience.\n\nThe upstairs bar features an expansive craft beer selection with 50 unmarked taps. Impressively, our bartender has them all committed to muscle memory. Yes, I quizzed him.\n\nComplementing the wide variety of fermented suds was a menu consisting of cheese and meat boards, small appetizers, and eclectic entrees. I took the bartender's recommendation and ordered the Sovereign burger. Cheese fondue and onion jam layered on my medium rare? Yes please. Definitely cracks my top 10 list of all time burgers. The fries were golden crisp, and the spicy bicky sauce was great for dipping.\n\nI'd strongly recommend The Sovereign if you're shopping along Wisconsin Ave. and/or looking for an intimate drinkery with plentiful crafts and appetizing fare.", "Came here for a night cap after a great dinner in Georgetown. To say I expected to walk into this place would be an utter lie. This gem is tucked into an alleyway off of the main strip of Georgetown, with nothing more than some peculiar lantern's leading to a poorly lit stoop and door-- leading into an rather gorgeous restaurant and bar setting.\nMy friend and I headed upstairs, and found a nice quiet corner on the bar, with a romantically dim ambiance due to the lighting and designs on the walls (very tastefully done). We were greeted by a bartender after sitting down and explained the gist of what they have, handed us menu's and left us to decide on our needs. The beer list was very impressive, not overwhelmingly large, but a great size and very well diversified. We both ordered and before we knew it our drinks were before us and we were enjoying some fine beers over lovely conversation.\nBecause we had just had dinner, we weren't particularly hungry for any of the menu, but it all sounded tasty. I will absolutely be planning to go to this place on purpose for an outing with friends.", "If you're a beer lover, you've gotta check out this place. And even if you aren't extremely knowledgable about beer, the draft menu breaks them up into different categories which makes it easy to narrow down your selection. The service is impeccable-friendly, knowledgable, not pushy if you aren't in a hurry, etc. The food is Belgian, so it's fun to try something unique and different. The flatbreads make for a good appetizer. Cod entree was pretty good. I'd skip the skate fish-weird texture, almost like shredded chicken, but brown.

I always dislike when places overdress the lobster and pearl oyster delivers when it comes to not overdoing it. While some places give you a lobster roll with excess bread to spare, pearl oyster gives you more than enough lobster meat to where you'll go in with your fingers to grab the last pieces. The actual bread is perfect- it's light and buttery to the point where you won't feel guilty about your expensive indulgence.\n\nTo top it off, the shoestring fries are a perfect fit for a roll that's as delicate as this.\n\nRecently I picked up a few lobster rolls to eat with some friends after we had a discussion regarding where we've all had the best lobster rolls. Once they tasted pearl oyster, they agreed that they make the best lobster roll that they've ever had.\n\nSometimes my friends bring up pearl oyster and we all begin to drool, definitely give this place a shot if you haven't already!", "Pearl's never disappoints! Great West Village spot on quiet Cornelia Street where you can enjoy an always satisfying fish and seafood meal. We usually get there by 6 PM when they open to avoid a wait. Love their small menu, you can't go wrong with the delicious bouillabaisse, clam chowder or any of the daily specials. I've settled into ordering the fried oysters to start and the lobster roll served with shoestring fries just because they're that good and it's hard to find a better lobster roll anywhere!", "Pearl Oyster Bar was one of the first, and best, restaurants to fill a toasted hot dog bun with lobster and mayo and serve it to discerning Manhattanites. Such a simple combination, and yet so transcendent. This place is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants; I've spent many a night over their oysters. There's also a blackboard menu listing different kinds of fish, such as pan-roasted halibut or red snapper, lobsters both grilled and boiled.\n\nPearl doesn't take reservations but it's definitely worth waiting for a table - think of it was a short cut to Cape Cod! The line tends to move swiftly, and what the spot lacks in d\u00e9cor, it makes up for in taste.

A friend and I sat at a cramped wall-facing bar in between the entrance and the kitchen since we didn't want to wait for a table. Our waitress wasn't necessarily rude, but she was extremely busy and showed it in her outbursts and lack of service.\n\nThe lobster roll was massive, and I was incredibly stuffed by the end of the meal. It was a pleasant surprise that the dish came with half a plate of yummy skinny fries.\n\nMy only complaint (and I see that this is common amongst the Yelp reviews) is that the lobster roll had way too much mayo. I even requested not to have a lot of mayo, but the waitress said they pre-make the lobster portion. I also wish the lobster had more roll to neutralize the amount of mayo. Mid way through the meal, I had to take breaks to eat fries with ketchup so I wasn't so overwhelmed by the mayo.\n\nI would love to come back and try something else other than the lobster roll, considering how amazing all the plates looked coming out of the kitchen.\n\nBy the way, they only accept Visa and Mastercard.", "I wanted to update my review for this place. Now, I've been around. My boyfriend and I have been obsessed with mussels and oysters all summer. You'd think that we're getting paid to find out which places hands out the best seafood.

The proscuitto is sublime, it literally melts on your tongue, less than paper thin, so delicious you forget all social and dining protocol and have to consciously contain yourself from shoveling the whole order into your mouth like a starving beast.\n\nNow, after you've settled down a bit and enjoyed a generous pour from the excellent by-the-glass wine list, its time to really get serious and order some pasta.   I've had the bucatini all' amatriciana and the spaghetti alla carbaonara.  The bucatini is unreal.  Its so al dente, so perfectly sauced, so subtly porky, its almost too much to bear.  The guanciale is coarsely chopped and sticks to the pasta so you can nab some with every delectable bite.  The carbonara is perfectly balanced between egg, pecorino and coarse black pepper with the egg and the cheese binding together nicely and the pepper lending a pervasive kick throughout.  Delicious.\n\nI will have a hard time ordering anything else but I suppose I should force myself to branch out.   Molto Mario does it again.", "This is my second time at Lupa, and both visits have been nothing short of amazing. Tonight three of us shared an assortment of cured meats, vegetable dishes, a special chicken entree and two deserts. The three of us left debating which dish was the best, and no one could decide. 'Its not as if anything was bad... Everything was great. It's a matter of what was the greatest!'\n\nThe decor is also noteworthy- comfortable, chic and intimate, but the staff and music make me and my visiting friends feel at home.\n\nFinally, the wine list was amazing- and our waitress/bartender Emilia had great recommendations. We tried a range of white and red wines, and I particularly loved the after- meal Amaro.\n\nTry lupa. You can't go wrong- unless you fail to make a reservation!", "My friend and I were starving. We walked up and down the streets of Greenwich Village until we found a restaurant that looked busy enough, which means, the food is good.\n\nWe ordered the butternut squash and the calamari for appetizer. My friend had the oxtail gnocchi while I had the squid ink pasta.\n\nInteresting is what I would say.\nThe calamari was served over barley and cucumbers, a more refreshing type of dish, but I wouldnt order it again. My friend liked the butternut squash but we both agreed we would try something else next time.\n\nThe oxtail gnocchi dish was amazing. Kind of small for an entree, but pretty flavorful. Instead of the traditional gnocchi it was more like 2 flat patties, crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside.\n\nMy waiter warned me about the squid ink pasta tasting a bit briney. But I still went for it because I've always wanted to try it.\nSadly, I don't think its my thing. :( It tasted like pasta, boiled in sea water.\n\nSo overall, because the service was good, and it is a Mario Batali restaurant, I would come back and try something else. Maybe I'll find something I like next time.", "I love bone marrow. Lupa was on the mark last night. Perfectly prepared, just enough of a salty flavor, with a perfect crostini bread.\n\nI ordered the duck ragu with fresh pasta. Small portion ( if i was on chopped they might say it was not an entree size portion but and appetizer ).  The duck was cooked well but was lacking a little bit of salt to extract the flavor. The dish was a little bland but still very good.\n\nWe also ordered prosciutto and 3 cheese selection.

There is a menu on the wall that is in English and offers 5 items.  There is another menu on the wall with more things listed, but since it was in Korean I have no idea what else was offered.  We opted for the sliced pork (pork belly) and the bibimbap.  The pork cooks on the grill along with bean sprouts, garlic and kimchi.  Several condiment bowls are spread on the table as well.  It was all good, but not as good as others I have had.  The bibimbap is spread on the grill after you finish the \"first\" course.

The noodle is cool to look at but not in terms of taste.\n\nOverall the meal (meat + noodle) is not memorable. Lacking in side dishes (only kimchi, pickled jalapenos, and bean sprouts). The ice bowl is cool but not yummy.", "I love this place! First time I went was this past Sunday around 1PM, and there was barely anyone there. I had the pork samkyapsal, ice bowl naengmyun, and duck. Their grills are large, and though they may be able to squeeze people into there, they can't fit all of the food in there. There was just the two of us, but we could barely fit the food in there.\nFirst things first, ice bowl naengmyun--bowl is actually made out of ice, and they use a plate to hold the melting bowl. The naengmyun is also AMAZING. I've had many naengmyun in my life (in america and korea), and they've never managed to top this one.\nThe best part of having the duck was that she helped us grill it after prepping it with sprouts, mushrooms, and kimchi. Then she made sure to move the grilled veggies so that the pork samkyapsal wasn't touching them. She also asked us for refills (which sometimes korean restaurants don't even do anymore). Like the other reviews, we just had four small side dishes and sprout spicy soup, but I didn't come here for the side dishes...", "This is the worst experience I've ever had at a Korean BBQ place. Range of terrible to decent meat. Worst service ever.\nI tried it because all the other reviews said the sam gyup ssal is amazing but it was nothing special. If I noticed any difference it was that the meat was a little thicker than usual. It had no special taste and was pretty tough. Ham ji bak is still the best for sam gyup ssal.\nThe pork bulgogi was pretty good. We also ordered the tripe, which was the nastiest thing I've ever seen.\nBesides the mediocore meat, what was up with the tiny tables and the terrible service? The Mexican waitresses could not speak Korean or English. What they did try to say wasn't audible. I had to ask 3 times each for rice and water.\nNo banchan. No service. Super expensive ($18.99 for 2 slices of pork). Wth.\nWarning for people without a Korean speaking friend: they don't speak Korean at all.", "My friend comes here every time she visits NY, and she insisted we eat here during our trip. The surrounding area is unassuming and kind of hole in the wall, but the moment we walked in, the restaurant felt very homey and warm. We ordered pork belly and neck, and our waiter grilled the meat on the stone lid. There are plenty of sides, pickled veggies as well as garlic + bean sprouts to grill on top! The owner was so friendly and hospitable, which made our experience even better.  He cracked jokes with us throughout the night and always made sure we had enough of all the sides, bringing refills any time something looked low.

Start off with addictive spreads like tir\u015fik and sac tawa, before digging into hearty meats, available at lunch and dinner. Breakfast is no laughing matter though, with black sesame-studded bread, house preserves, kasheri cheese, and cucumbers dressed in olive oil.

I used to live in Istanbul, and have been looking for a place that makes a decent Anatolian-style breakfast. The Gundis far exceeded my expectations with the varieties of food they offered as part of their breakfast spread. The most important component of an Anatolian breakfast is tea, and The Gundis offered bottomless glasses of excellent imported \"ka\u00e7ak\" tea. On top of this was eggs with sucuk (a type of sausage), cucumber and tomato, green and black olives, three varieties of cheese, butter, three varieties of jam, honey, tahini with pekmez (grape molasses), cheese borek (a phyllo pastry with cheese). All of the ingredients were obviously high quality, artisan items. All this food is all served with delicious sesame bread. The price might initially strike you as a little high, but three people could easily share the breakfast for two and the tea is bottomless.\n\nService was excellent, and one of the owners Mehmet came by to chat with me and my dining partner. Service was attentive and prompt with tea refills. I hope to come back to try their lunch and dinner options, but for now highly recommend The Gundis as the only place in Chicago for a delicious and authentic Anatolia breakfast!", "A chic Kurdish restaurant in Chicago? Count me in! I was really impressed by this place. The decor is clean, a rustic/modern hybrid of sorts. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. And all the food was delicious, fresh, authentic, and presented really well. As somebody who frequents middle eastern jaunts fairly often, this is much appreciated.\n\nAll of the meze were delicious and on point. The bread they brought out was fresh and crispy. The mardin stew and lamb sac tawa were so good, especially the lamb. The adana kebab was pretty good.\n\nThey even have salgam, this root vegatable-based drink. Not the most refreshing thing in the world, but super authentic! I've never had kurdish coffee before, but it's somewhat creamier and crushed pistachio topping was a nice retreat from the usual turkish coffee!\n\nGreat to see such a well-run spot surpass all my expectations.", "Very friendly and hospitable, and some of the things are tasty, but this place needs some work before I am going to get excited about it.\n\nOur appetizers were very good -- a fried haloumi cheese that seemed to have an unusual bit of pop (though that might just be a heavy hand with the olive oil and whatever else was used to dress it), and a grilled calamari dish that had a surprisingly spicy and pleasant sauce with some kind of earthy crushed chile, and hints of other spices. The bread we started with was dry and crumbly, though later on we got some warm bread which was okay.\n\nOur entrees, however, needed some work.  The waitress was enthusiastic about the Lamb Mezopatamia I ordered, and my wife had a stir-fried lamb dish. Both of them had generous services of meat, rice, and vegetables, but really needed some seasoning and additional flavor. Luckily, our third dining companion had ordered the Marzin Special, which came swimming in two sauces, one of which was a quite flavorful garlic yogurt sauce. I tried a few bites of my dish elevated with the sauce and it was much better. But when that ran out, we were stuck with generous servings of meat, rice, and vegetables, in desperate need of something to make them taste exciting.", "Quaint, but elegant - located in a pretty poppin part of Chicagoland. If you want to actually experience the Kurdish culture, by way of food, you have to get the platter that comes with the assorted accouterments. This is how breakfast is served in Iraq! Your eggs are scrambled with tomatoes, onions and peppers along with meat (go with the lamb!). Smorgasbord is the definition of an Iraqi/Kurdish breakfast, and bread is used not only for the jams, but to scoop up the eggs - like little handheld sandwiches. This is authentic, this is delicious. My wife, from Baghdad, no longer wants to eat anywhere else!! Awesome food, awesome drinks, great service, exquisite presentation.", "Everything about The Gundis left me wanting to come back for more. The glass facade welcomes visitors into the warm glow of hanging lamps in a lofted space with brick walls and modern wood floors.\n\nThe space is very communal, everyone sits in one room. It is warm and cozy.\n\nMuch thought has been put into the food and drinks. The Gundis Salad is so fresh and flavorful. The Kurdish coffee, I learned from Denise, a co-owner, is made from pistachio beans. Pure heaven.\n\nEverything on the menu looks delicious. We'll definitely be back.", "Restaurant has a gorgeous set-up with a very romantic vibe to it. It's pretty quiet on weekdays and great for a date.

It reminded me of my days in Turkey, where drinking numerous cups of tea is a tradition.\n\nI ordered the Zaza pasta. It was delicious and very appetizing. Prefect amount of spices.

Nor, I didn't see the value in this restaurant compared to several other Mexican restaurants I have tried in the area.", "Worth the drive and wait! I am rating 5 Stars because it's worth it! Quality food, great service and cute hole in the wall spot!\n\nYou have to order their Blanco y Negro which is Horchata with Iced Coffee.....it's life changing!\n\nI've ordered their taco plate (Birria and Chicken) and they are AMAZING! Carne Asada is good too! Rice and beans are delicious as well as their Chips, Guac and Salsa!\n\nBrunch time on the weekend will get a bit hairy, so make sure you order drinks and apps while you wait!\n\nKids, order chicken and rice and beans on the side.

Thanks for using fresh seasonal produce and herbs to make your dishes pop.  \n\nFavorites:\n-ollita de pobre, so humble and simple but oh so good.  Go veg or carnitas, skip the beef.  \n-chips and guac, super\n-tacos, the grilled chicken, so smoky and tender, I dream about these\n-fresh handmade tortillas are nice and toothsome\n-gordita, it's like a taco burger!  With pork belly!\n-any of their seasonal salads, from nopales to honeydew, who knew tarragon would go with melon?!?\n-steak, perfectly seasoned and cooked medium rare\n\nAnd yes all the fillers, rice and beans are perfection.\n\nAll the food is good here, quality ingredients, executed well and doesn't feel heavy.  Love LOVE!", "Some of the best Tex-Mex I've had in the Bay Area (and I've lived in SoCal and TX for most of my life!). We had 2 great cocktails (the pear margarita and the Tres Rojas) that were super tasty and well-made. The chips and salsa and guac were very tasty and a decent sized portion. The pozole soup, the quesadilla, and the chile verde colorado enchilada were all very flavorful with super fresh and tasty ingredients. The portions were all quite big, too! THe staff were friendly and accomodating; we showed up during the dinner rush with no reservation on a Friday night and they allowed us to grab an unused table for an hour (which was plenty of time to eat and chill). They were constantly cleaning the tables between guests and the outdoor area was covered and had many heat lamps. The prices were a bit high overall, but we did get a pretty large amount of quite tasty food.", "Most definitely a gem to dine at in Oakland. Nido has really solid selection all across the board and have a very unique menu. I always go for guac and chips here and their horchata is real yummy.  \n\nI recommend their tacos all across the board, may it be their chicken, carne asada, or carnitas, you have to try them all.\n\nReally cool vibe and d\u00e9cor and the service is super friendly too.", "Nido is one of my favorite restaurants in Oakland. It was the go-to place for my colleagues and I, who worked nearby, but I also enjoyed coming over the weekend to try out their brunch specials.\n\nThe one dish that I order every time is the Ollita Pobre with chicken and veggies. The chicken thigh is grilled with skin, so it is really tasty, but for health reasons, I wish they offered a chicken breast option. Moving on to the mixed veggies...they are amazingly flavorful and include kale, squash, and onion. This is served with rice, beans, avocado, and homemade corn tortillas. You'll have leftovers for lunch the next day!\n\nThe restaurant is cozy with a large bar area and limited seating, so you may want to make reservations for a group larger than 6.  Even though it's very close to the freeway (literally right next to the entrance to 880), they do a great job of creating a welcoming entrance with plants and brightly colored walls/murals.\n\nAnother plus is that the staff are really friendly! Can't wait to eat here again!", "A friend recommended Nido a few months ago, and on my way back to Alameda from SF this Sunday afternoon I decided to finally drop-by. The young lady who served me was enthusiastic, warm and helpful with my final choices. I had the Sopes de Chorizo y Huevos = excellent choice. There was a great mixture of spice, potato, meat, avocado, homemade salsa, beans, cheese and egg. I am not typically a \"flan\" person, but this server sold me on perhaps the best flan I have ever tasted. The consistency was brilliant, firm on the plate and spoon, then dissolved completely once hitting my mouth. I am sold on Nido.

We moved back east in March and came back to SB for a visit. We wanted to experience Mesa Verde again because there probably  isn't another restaurant like it anywhere in the country, and that says a lot. The food is totally unique, even the humus and flatbread, both being wonderfully seasoned with a combination of herbs of different flavors. It was easily enough for the three of us. My wife had a delicious risotto dish and I had their vegetable tacos that were magnificent. We also had two of the delicious California salads that were more than enough for all of us.\n\nTwo pointers, be adventuresome because you can't tell what the dishes will taste like from reading the ingredients. You might also want to tell the server the order you'd like the food served otherwise you'll get it pretty much altogether in which case you can have a little of each dish and experience your food that way.\n\nAll dishes except two are vegan and many gluten free. The menu is clearly marked. But please don't think of this restaurant as only for vegans and vegetarians (we are not either). It is for people who appreciate creative cooking at its very best, besides being very healthy.", "We loved everything! Picadilo jackfruit tacos, mushroom umami burger, LaLa smoothie (add almond butter), hummus and pita and an incredible baklava with soy ice cream dessert. Everything tastes as good as it looks.  My hubby is a big meat eater but daughter and I are veg. He said it's the best veg food ever and best dessert of any kind. We wish we lived closer. Such a treat. Everything was so incredibly fresh, great textures and mixes of flavors. I wish we weren't in such a hurry with such a hungry kid to just relax. We finished every bite.", "First thing I did when I arrived in Santa Barbara was research local vegan restaurants. Found Mesa Verde so we decided to have dinner there tonight. We walked into a nice restaurant decorated with reclaimed wood and greeted by friendly staff. We started off with the Cashew Cheese Board then had the Grilled Peach and Avocado Salad. Followed by the Rajas Tacos and the Flat Bread with Hummus, Figs and Caramelized Onions. For dessert we had Baklava with Vanilla Ice cream and pistachios. The dishes all came out with such great presentation and the flavors were delicious. My mother who is not vegan but has eaten at vegan restaurants with me reluctantly, loved everything we ate at Mesa Verde. We need to have one open up in Ventura or LA County! If you're planning a trip to Santa Barbara, make sure you pay a visit to Mesa Verde. You will not be disappointed.", "This hidden gem is deserving of 6 stars. You are greeted with a warm friendly smile as you walk in and the great service continues throughout your dining experience. My wife are avid \"Yelpers\" and always look for the best. This place did not disappoint. We started with the polenta fries, which were crisped to perfection. This dish along would have been worthy enough of the 5 stars. My wife ordered the BLT and I ordered the Street Taco. As an avid meat eater, I was somewhat skeptical; however, I'm a foodie so I'm up to trying anything once. I have to say that these dishes seriously convinced me that meat isn't needed in everything. To top the customer service off, the manager gave us a complementary desert that was amazing. This hands down is a place that you must stop at while in Santa Barbara.", "My girl and I found this place like a lot of folks perhaps, by typing \"vegan\" into yelp in Santa Barbara. What a great choice. I got the Picadillo Empanadas, and it was (no exaggeration) one of the best meals I can remember. Not just vegan meals, mind you, but best ever. It was THAT good. As was the hospitality and conversation from the entire staff. This is the kind of place you recommend to everyone you know. Seek it out.", "Haven't been in since the pandemic but miss it more than anywhere. Don't let the odd location fool you, it is really enjoyable inside (when its warm anyway, in winter it can get a bit too cool even inside for we wimpy So Cal gals). Food is almost always super! But wouldn't recommend the overpriced, tiny, and average desert. Otherwise, delightful!", "Today was my second visit to Mesa Verde  my first visit was last Wednesday. It's that good that I had to come back in the same week! We live in Ojai and made a special trip up to have my husband try it out. The first time I got their amazing hummus and the Jupiter smoothie. My body felt so much better after that!\nToday my husband got the BLTA, the cold pressed Persephone and the Posideon smoothie. So delicious!\nThe owner is so kind and accommodating. His staff is also terrific, very polite and knowledgeable. We were able to sample their cold pressed juices, all of which were so yummy.\nThe d\u00e9cor and cleanliness are also extremely inviting. Very calming environment, both indoors and outdoors. This is a hidden treasure! Whenever we are in Santa Barbara, this will be our spot  \nThank you Mesa Verde for such an amazing experience. I cannot wait to try the rest of the menu", "Best cheese cake ever!  My [non-vegan] girlfriend loved its creaminess and fluffiness. It was a delicate balance of sweet pumpkin and coconut flavor served with flower petals.\nFood here is a work of art. It's is both colorful and delicious.\nWe tried two sandwiches.

We started with the tom yum soup, pork satay and papaya salad, all delicious. For mains we had the pumpkin curry, steak salad and chicken drumsticks in a curry sauce. Pumpkin curry was my favorite with nice kick of heat. Also the chicken was fall off the bone tender. A final noodle dish came out which comes a couple minutes after the other mains and we were decently fool by that point. It was tasty as well with nice portion of veggies but I thought the noodles were way over cooked so they were kinda mushy. For dessert they have sticky rice with berries and sliced mango...

They give plenty of choices and enough meat, fish, and vegetable options to satisfy a crowd.\n\nIf I could complain about one thing from this particular experience it would be that we arrived later on a Thursday night and some of our dishes lacked some of the \"good stuff\" - in an essentially family style restaurant, someone is eventually going to get the last of what's in the pan/pot and it happened to us in two of our dishes. Our pad Thai was mostly just bean sprouts and tofu, hardly any noodles and there was maybe one piece of fish. I also felt like the soup was missing some veggies too.

Unfortunately, there were a lot of strikes against it. While the food is still good, the experience is overly rushed. The restaurant was half empty, so there was no need to keep bringing dishes to us back to back - i.e. the entrees before we finished the appetizer. Also the food while good, just wasn't the same exceptional quality I had before at the other location.\n\nHere's the real kicker though-while waiting to pay, we noticed a mouse scampering across the dining room. He seemed quite at home among the customers, walking along the edge of the room and then back into the wall and then back out again. Not wanting to cause alarm among the other guests, I got up and told the host. She seemed apologetic, but honestly, considering, I expect more. She said they would take care of it the next day and thanked me for telling her and said she was sorry. I get it - its DC, they are in an old row house, and mice are common.

It's bigger than their other location (which is made to feel like someone's house from what I've heard), but I thought the food was great. The menu is fixed every night so you never know what exactly you'll get, but there are some staples (like the pumpkin curry). You get a couple of appetizers, maybe 3-4 entrees, then a pad thai, and rounded out with mango sticky rice for dessert. Everything we ate was amazing (especially the pumpkin curry and the dessert), and it was a really cool experience.", "Had an amazing experience with the chef special menu! It started off with a soup (shrimp Tom kha), salad (papaya salad) and an appetizer (spring roll).

We were so full at this point that we were expecting the dessert at this point. But to our surprise, there was another entree! It was the pad see ew, which was pretty good too.

We asked for new plates and forks . However, ten minutes later, here came our server asking us if there is anything else we want to order and placed down a receipt, then they took all our plates and food away without even asking. Is this a normal procedure of this restaurant to bring a receipts to customers and clean up everything without even asking after just an hour of eating.

Getting a glass of water refilled or waiting for condiments took too long.\n\nAs expected, cocktails are expensive, but well balanced.\n\nFood is presented in a modern and attractive manner. We especially liked the flavors of the Jade Hearts (gourd with peppercorn sauce) and Kung Po Tofu ( a little too gooey). A friend highly recommended the Hot and Sour Pork Xiao Long Bao. After trying them, I can't understand why. It's a creative attempt that's unsuccessful. The order is just 3 dumplings that taste okay. The meat inside had a mushy texture that I didn't like.", "Just walking into a restaurant, you are greeted with an air of elegance and sophistication. 'Hutong' are a type of narrow street or alley commonly associated with northern Chinese cities, especially Beijing so the fact that this restaurant was lavishly decorated and in Art Deco style felt weirdly fitting for an 'upscale' take on Chinese food.\n\nA group of 3 of us ordered the following and were comfortably full with no leftovers:\n- Wagyu Mille Feuille (perfectly crisp exterior and rich gooey interior)\n- Charcoal Yu Xiang Crispy Pork Dumplings (nothing mindblowing here but the texture of the outside was reminiscent of a mochi-like dimsum which was interesting)\n- Roasted Half Peking Duck (this was actually delicious but very expensive for what it was)\n- Eggplant Tempura (this was forgettable - I would skip it)\n- Bao & Soy Milk (a wonderfully creative and well-balanced dessert that had a white sesame seed mousse in the shape of a bao paired with soy milk ice cream)\n\nOverall, I liked the ingenuity of the dishes we tried as well as their unique flavor profiles but felt they were a bit too expensive for what you get. I'd definitely see this as a nice celebration meal place or somewhere you could go for a corporate event.", "This is a terrible restaurant.

This place is going to be the crown jewel of the Midtown restaurants, which normally have a crowd I find too stuffy and food that doesn't stuff me enough.

For starters, we found the Ko Shui Chicken to be spicy, tasty, and addicting! The spice packs a punch. The Yu Xiang Crispy Pork Dumpling was definitely unique. It's a striking presentation, the shape of limes but completely black. The outside is thick and fried and the inside is fragrant and fishy. It wasn't our favorite taste, though, definitely not reminiscent of any usual dim sum. The fried part was simply too thick. The Kung Po Tofu was a let down. The sauce and cashews weren't bad, but the substance around the tofu itself was gooey, like gelatin. The texture of hard jello around tofu, was strange and slightly nauseating.\n\nOur favorite part by far was the tea (we got a water refill!) which we each got several cups of over our two hour lunch.

We started with cocktails and wine seated at their attractive and spacious bar prior to dinner.  When seated for our meal, most of us started with the potato gnocchi and Spanish octopus which was absolutely superb.  Nice large pieces of octo accompanied by smoked tomato puttanesca, pomano beans, castelvetrano olives and tasty basil bead crumbs.  Such uniqueness in taste that our group raved about.  For dinner, the Liberty Valley duck breast was perfectly done medium rare and included figs, chickpea panisse, beets and foie gras sauce.  Simply unbelievable in presentation and taste that left us feeling like we just had the most marvelous meal.  I got a taste of the grilled angus New Your strip steak which was also amazing.  A robust wine list is offered where we selected first, an elegant Pinot Noir then transition to a more full bodied Switchback Merlot which both accompanied our meal perfectly.

Appetizers were the Green Goddess Salad (not much for a $14 salad, but it was delicious) and the asparagus (no need to try it even though the burrata was a fantastic compliment but I am not a fan of cold asparagus - reminds me of being out of a can).\n\nOur entrees were the Berkshire pork and Sea Scallops.  Pork was fantastic, scallops were whatever.\n\nThe highlight was dessert with the excellent oatmal cookie Ice Cream Sandwiches.\n\nI would go again, but probably go simple with a Green Goddess Salad and the ice cream sandwiches...skip the main course :)", "Went here for brunch on a nice sunny day.  Parking was plentiful and restaurant was decorated and sleek.\n\nService was really attentive and I enjoyed our meal.

The fries came assembled like Jenga pieces which I found amusing. The Monkey Bread was like a fancy cinnamon bun without the uber sweet frosting.\n\nI like Prospect. On the weekend there's plentiful parking (no need to use the valet). I've been to many brunch places and this is definitely up there on my list.", "Since my in-laws were in town, we treated ourselves to a nice dinner out. Got a last-minute reservation with four friends. We had sort of forgotten what it was like to sit through a two-hour meal without our kids.\n\nThe food was excellent, especially the soft-shelled crab and tomato appetizer. Really enjoyed the monkfish as well, and my wife's hanger steak was tasty. All of their entrees come with a few bites of several different sides. Finished off the meal with some rather large desserts, including an ice cream sundae and a chocolate tart.\n\nIt's quite a large restaurant with nice natural lighting before it gets dark (as evidenced by my photos). Our server was really friendly and unpretentious; she was proactive about explaining some of the more obscure items on the menu.\n\nIt's close to the water, so we wandered through the ferry building both before and after our meal here.

The chicken sandwich is always a crowd pleaser. If you're looking for something on the healthier side, my go to dish is the chicken salad -- which is really just an incredibly flavorful roast chicken breast atop a bed of quinoa and kale that absorb all that delicious chicken jus.\n\nI'd strongly recommend making reservations for lunch just to be on the safe side."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/prospect-san-francisco?hrid=ZTZ4y6lN2vNIkVJVtmiZug&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/prospect-san-francisco?hrid=wKbYUUg4vZ8j1hmED-zGIg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/prospect-san-francisco?hrid=TCynMOii2SX4_yOL7VnIrA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/prospect-san-francisco?hrid=sWs_fkT2r9yQsUIJ3z5KIQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/prospect-san-francisco?hrid=OV16p1g5yVuXQQjPOhyyew&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/prospect-san-francisco?hrid=PyNFhMFU7Lg9owtB8xIW9w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Coast &amp; Valley", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/coast-and-valley-new-york/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/coast-valley", "michelin_pov": "This restaurant knows you\u2019ve been dreaming about Cali again.

Service was quick and attentive and one of the owners came over to chat and share some of their story with us. It was a really nice, honest touch and you can see how passionate they are about their restaurant. We've already started planning on who we want to take back to C&V in the next few weeks.

The pour was not at all generous, especially considering this place is new. If two people with professional jobs cannot enjoy this place I don't know who can. Also, If you have visited wineries in N.

The red oil chaoshou is a must try.  The chili oil has earthy roasted notes along with a sweetness which intermingles nicely with the spicy heat.  I prefer the chaoshou over the wonton although this is more personal taste as both are excellent.  The Chengdu ZaJing noodles are another must order dish here.  Again the spice here has a layered complexity, which when combined with the ground pork and fried egg, hits all the right savory notes in very satisfying way.  The house beef noodles features that karate chop to the palate numbing spice for those wanting a more intense noodle experience.

Beautiful and decadent. Creative plays with tamago, especially with a warm crab concoction and your nori-wrapped tamago finish? Faaaantastic. Some of the nigiri might be a little heavy with wasabi, but these guys are preparing some grade-A food, and it isn't going unnoticed.

I thought the black tuna was fresh but overpriced, the agedashi tofu I would not order again (not enough flavor, the texture was a bit off), but I did REALLY like the uni special roll we got.

I've eaten at a lot of fine dining places and some of the dishes were really interesting still. It is about 6 courses for $69. This is very reasonable pricing. The one down side is that the portions are pretty small. If you come with a guy, I don't think they will be full at all. They fill you up at the cheese course where they give you a huge piece of brioche and different variety of cheeses. The brioche is way too big. They need to work on their portion sizes a bit more.

Maybe I'm becoming more of a sushi snob, or that there are now other sushi places that are better.", "Upon learning about the one hour quoted wait time at Yuzu down the street, my friend and I decided to shell out a little bit for what a lot of fellow Yelpers consider the best sushi in Chicago. We wanted to ease it in by ordering some sashimi and specialty rolls. If good, we were gonna try some of their pretty popular small plates. Unfortunately we never got around to ordering more, because the quality was just not all that impressive.\n\nWe got the botan ebi sashimi, regular saki sashimi, and uni nigiri. The shrimp looked a bit too opaque. Salmon was fine. Uni was good. Overall the food was pretty fresh, but for the price and portion, I expected to taste the ocean breeze if you know what I mean.\n\nThe specialty rolls were good but nothing spectacular. We got the Trio Maki and the Hamachi Sake Zuke Maguro. The chili oil on the Trio Maki was a bit too overpowering, but other than that, a good roll. I did appreciate the fish/rice ratio.\n\nI think for good sushi, I will just stick to Kai Zan from now on. ARAMI is trendy and fun, but be prepared to pay for the decor and whatever intangibles people chalk up their dining experience to. Their food just isn't worth it.", "I found this gem on Open Table as I was making dinner reservations to celebrate my birthday. We decided to go all out and do it up right. It was perfect.\n\nI was surprised because the exterior is very deceiving. Once you get in, you are welcomed with earthy tones and an intimate atmosphere. This is casual dining at its best. We were not rushed through the ordering process. Our servers were very knowledgeable and totally on top of their game. Professional. Period. They were quick to clear plates and always kept our glasses full.\n\nNow about the food. Fresh, top-quality, a melody of flavors and a fabulous menu! We started with scallops cooked with brown ponzu butter that left us wanting more. We also ordered one of the specialty rolls with unagi. It was savory and finished with the sweetness of the eel sauce. We also ordered the a tako roll which had spicy octopus topped with Apple and other delicious goodness. And finally the Soft shell crab with spicy ebi. This one was my favorite and I heard the server tell the table next to is they sold out of it! We got lucky. We capped it off with the mochi combo which was just right. The pistachio was my fav. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and will be back with friends!", "this has stepped up to my favorite sushi restaurant in the city. everything here is beautifully presented and equally delicious. unfortunately, it's one of those places where i want to order everything on the menu. i've now been twice and have covered a vast part of the menu (so piggy!). my favorites include: the maguro kani--king crab wrapped with marinated tuna with shaved almonds on top. oh. my. god. so good. the tonkatsu don: pork cheek with braised cabbage over rice. the uni shooter. their tuna sashimi is great. really liked their softshell and spicy ebi roll. am i embarrassing myself yet? yes? the tartar bite is also great and you wish it was so much bigger than it is. i love sitting at the sushi counter here--watching everyone work is really fascinating and the chefs are all friendly. the manager john runs a tight ship and should be commended--props!", "I haven't been to Arami in years, so we decided to stop by for dinner to change up our usual sushi scene. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I wasn't too impressed with our dinner. The interior is nice, the music was fun and the menu was large. The food was good, but nothing really stood out to me to justify the higher price.\n\nWe ordered two uni nigiris, tori karaage, shishito robata, spicy tako ebi maki, and maguro spicy sake maki. The uni nigiri was good and it came with freshly grated wasabi. The tori karaage was a large portion and the pickled peppers were a nice touch. The shishito robata tasted like what I expected and I always like katsuobushi on anything. Our maki rolls were good, but a little small.\n\nAgain, the food was fine, however, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here since I already have a great sushi place with slightly better prices. We were content with the amount of food we ordered, but we would have added another dish to seal the deal if it weren't already an expensive dinner.", "Everything was delicious. Great experience. Wagu ribeye was incredible along the very fresh nigiri. Enjoyed it with a nice bottle of Kurosawa sake. We finished it off with some great honey flavored ice cream. Been here a couple times and it's never failed. Just recently opened up to nigiri (non-roll) dishes and this was my favorite try so far., We didn't have to wait and it wasn't overly crowded because it was a weeknight.

As a fan of art deco it's almost everything I could ask for visually. You almost forget you are in the middle of the Tenderlion after walking into the lobby of this art deco masterpiece.  They spared no expense in every nook and cranny of this restaurant.  I can only assume the hotel has done the same by the looks of the lobby.  \n\nThe bonus was the food was fantastic.  We had a wide range of dishes that night and the biggest hits for me were the Dashi Flan and the Hawaiian bread. Loved the squid ink tagliatelle except it had a little too much garlic for my tastes.  Sadly we drank so much we didn't save room for desserts. There will definitely be a next time. Speaking of cocktails they were on point to no surprise considering the involvement of BV Hospitality.  Staff was friendly and informative when it came to the menu as well as any questions you might have of the place itself.\n\nFor me it's one of the best new restaurants I've been to in some time in San Francisco.

Good Food!  \nMy friend was coming from luncheon but I insisted that she order something.  So she ordered kennebec fries. They tasted twice fried and were crunchy and delicious.  They came with an aioli and a red sauce that I couldn't place.  I ordered grilled chicken with savory greens and hickory nuts circled by super delicious yams.  It was savory, complex with multiple taste tones, and so nice to the mouth front, middle and back. Very satisfying.  I could have ordered just the greens and yams and been in heaven.  The staff was very friendly and projected a pride about their restaurant and hotel.  We also visited the rooftop which opens at 3:00.  The rooftop space is huge but familial, with gorgeous views that run the eye east to the Ferry building and west all the way up market.   Everyone we encountered was super friendly in a sincere and genuine way.  I think you should put it on your list of must things to do.", "I don't even know where to start--this place was so good.\n\nThe interior design feels like you're in London at high-end boutique outside of Harrods. Light turquoise adorns the bar area and the lounge is decorated with a hodgepodge fun mismatched furniture and abstract art.\n\nWhen we arrived, without a reservation, we were still seated right away in the lounge area with access to the full menu. The hostess complimented my wife's coat and offered her a lint roller when I noticed a small patch of our puppy's hair on the lapel.\n\nThroughout the meal we had a team of people, in addition to our knowledgeable server, taking care of us.\n\nI had probably the best avocado toast of my life. It sat on top of large, rustic, crusty bread. The avocado was mixed with tomatoes and seasoning and topped with a perfect poached egg.\n\nMy wife had the quiche and it was excellent as well.\n\nI highly recommend stopping here for brunch before a matinee at The Orpheum theatre.", "came here for the nutcracker holiday tea service, which was $55 for the tea, sandwiches, and pastries. i LOVE high tea and am always excited to try a new high tea spot in the city. this was also fairly reasonably priced given the amount of food, which was great. we were seated in the proper hotel lobby for our tea service, which was was super cute. that being said, the service left a lot to be desired. it took us forever to get a waiter to come over even though all we needed to choose was our tea selection. it also took us a while to get utensils and water, which seem like basics. one of our servers was super sweet and did take a lot of photos for us, but the other wasn't very helpful. the pastries themselves were pretty good but very sweet and served separately from the sandwiches- would've been nice if they had come together to break up the sweet. also, they asked if we had any dietary restrictions and confirmed that egg was okay for me (i'm vegetarian) and still gave me two sweet sandwiches :/, which was pretty disappointing. not sure if i'd be back, but glad i had the experience!", "Came here before watching Hamilton at the Orpheum. Hubby and I started off with the seafood chowder and ceviche tostada. While I enjoyed my tostada, the seafood chowder won me over as it was super yummy, with chunks of fresh salmon and sprinkled with roe eggs. Hubby ordered the braised short rib melt, which is a great sandwich for those that love meat as the short ribs were extremely tender and flavorful. The restaurant couldn't offer local fish the day of our visit, as the chef wasn't satisfied with the fish selection, so jumbo shrimps were used in lieu of fish. While I was initially disappointed, the jumbo shrimp dish was well put together and delicious.\n\nIn addition to great food, service was friendly and prompt, as the waitstaff realized a majority of those dining were attending a show after lunch.\n\nWould definitely return to try dinner in the future!", "What a gem in the heart of SF.

Headed by a trio of Per Se veterans, Noreetuh features an intimate setting of two slender dining rooms adorned with hexagonal mirrors and shelving units used to store bottles from the impressive wine list.\nThe kitchen turns out contemporary and sophisticated interpretations of Hawaiian cuisine. Classics like the humble musubi is elevated with the likes of pork jowl and beef tongue, while the parmesan cheese-topped Kalua pork cavatelli's richness is balanced by perfect portions of pickled cabbage. Imported ingredients such as shrimp from Kauai and the famous King's Hawaiian sweet bread are sure to invoke nostalgia among the expats.", "yelp_reviews": ["When one thinks of \"Hawaiian food\" the unfortunate associations are to tikis, platters of food fried to unrecognizable oblivion, and tacky sugary drinks with umbrellas.  If that's your desire, Noreetuh is not for you.  Noreetuh is New American with heavy Hawaiian and Pacific Rim influences.  Take for example a standard Hawaiian appetizer, poke (pronounced like the \"pokey\" of \"hokey pokey\"), which is sashimi grade fish that is akin to tuna tartare and not ceviche, the latter which has citrus juice in it.\n\nOne does not have to be Hawaiian to appreciate the gracious and attentive service of Noreetuh.  Certainly being from Hawaii helps one recognize the local influences of Spam that is sneaked into the torteloni and the Kings Bakery Hawaiian sweet bread made into a pudding.  But one just has to be a good eater to appreciate the flavors of truffle dusted taro chips and the mentaiko spaghetti.  It's been weeks since I dined there and I still can't get the flavors of the mentaiko spaghetti out of my mind, briny, creamy, salty, all at once. Check them out.  You'll be glad you did even though there' nary a tiki or torch in sight.", "Absolutely wowed by the upside down pineapple cake - so much so that I need to talk about it first before the entrees and apps! A generous ring of sweet pineapple on top of a warm moist cake served with pineapple and cherry ice cream. I could eat this everyday! My only complaint was the ratio of ice cream to cake; if only there was more cake!\n\nBack to main courses: the tuna poke app tasted authentic albeit a little too salty. I got the kalua pork cavatelli entree which was a very interesting fusion of Hawaiian and Italian fare. The pickled cabbage added a bit of a sour note while the Parmesan elevated the umami already brought to the dish by the pork. I would definitely return to try other items on their menu.", "3.5 stars.\n\nVery cute (and dark) restaurant with two small dining areas great for an intimate date. They allow reservations. I came here with a friend for restaurant week ($42 per person).\n\nSalmon poke: delicious; a very balanced concoction of flavors. Get it.\n\nTuna poke: not as good; the flavor of the tuna was overpowered by the sauce, and the tuna itself was flavorless.\n\nPineapple pork belly: very good; small portion of pork belly, but skillfully prepared and beautifully presented.\n\nBass: disappointing; the crispy fish was plain and boring... I wish we hadn't ordered it.\n\nKing's Hawaiian bred pudding: very tasty (and bigger in size than the pork belly); if you love bread pudding, you should get this.\n\nOverall, although there were some issues with the other dishes, we enjoyed the salmon poke, the pork belly and the bread pudding. I was happy to pay $42 for the good dishes, but the others weren't worth that price.", "We came on Valentine's Day to try this restaurant for the first time. I have to say it was a pleasurable experience. My first impression of Noreetuh is the small space however, it gives a warm and coziness to the place. Noreetuh offered the prie-fixed course we decided to get, which included snacks, starters and entree. There is wine pairing for a separate price, however we decided on getting a bottle of Sparkling wine. For snacks, we choose the Beef Tongue Musubi and Silken Tofu. The Beef Tongue Musubi were savory, flavorful and delicious. I love it and will be coming back for more. Follow by starters, we chose the Tuna Poke and Grilled Octopus. Then for our entree, we have the Hanger Steak and Uni Spaghetti. The steak was cooked to perfection with delicious pesto sauce. And the Uni Spaghetti was creamy and exquisite.\n\nEverything was perfect from the service to food. The manager or owner Jin took care of us very well. The service was very personalized, and he was knowledgeable about his wines. Provided us with good suggestions. I definitely will be coming back with more friends.", "Came here for RW and the menu showcased their great dishes.  If you are looking for something different (like other than steak or pasta), this is definitely different (Hawaiian cuisine).\n\nOrdered tuna poke as appetizer, very generous portion, tuna was fresh and delicious, would like it a bit chill.  It was quite filling.\n\nPork belly was my main course.  It was tender and melt in your mouth.  Love the polenta and corn sauce.  \n\nHawaiian bread pudding with pineapple ice cream was my dessert.  The bread pudding was warm and SO delicious.  It was a big piece and I finished every bite.  \n\nWould definitely come back for the bread budding.......\n\nThe lighting was too dark to take photo of my dishes and I would like to see my beautiful food......", "Noreetuh's been on our list for awhile since we've always wanted to try Hawaiian and where better to start than somewhere opened by a per se alum (other than Hawaii of course). Definitely feeling underwhelmed by our meal... Seems to be a collection of well executed dishes, but very little unique flavoring that differentiates it as Hawaiian fare.\n\nAppetizer:\nCorned Beef tongue mitsubi - a little too salty since the tongue is to replace spam. But enjoyed the peanuts and cilantro sauce to pair.\n\nTuna poke - definitely recommend, pickled jalape\u00f1o adds a nice twist with some heat. Good starter to your meal.\n\nEntree:\n\nChow noodles - great texture on the chewy noodles, morels absorbed butter exquisitely. Every bite with morels delivered super umami deliciousness.\n\nGarlic shrimp - while shrimp was done well, the dish overall fell flat with little creativity.\n\nIf you're itching for a new place to try out in the area, definitely stop by.

The restaurant is easy to miss from the outside but that lends itself to a very cozy vibe inside. It's dark and rustic and fairly barebones - which is okay with me because that makes the food and drink the absolute focus.\n\nEvery time we come here we always start with the charcuterie plate.

And more importantly, unlike most cheese plates in the city, the bread is not a limp, spongey, tasteless grocery store excuse for a baguette...  warm, chewy sourdough baguette had the pungent aroma and amazing texture of real sourdough and the grilled sunflower oat bread was nutty and soul-satisfying for this carb lover.\n\nThe \"small\" plate of perfectly grilled beef heart with morels and foie gras was generous and delicious as was the hangar steak with salsa verde.\n\nFantastic, diverse and interesting wines by the glass and selection of beer and ciders.\n\nAbsolutely plan to become regulars at this west town neighborhood gem despite not being from the 'hood.", "I went to Table, Donkey, Stick last night with a group of 5 girlfriends, and had an amazing time!

The burrata was your typical burrata (good), but the artichokes were special.  They had a nice light fry, but the inside was nice and soft.  Really enjoyed these.  \n\nFor mains, we went pretty heavy on the carbs and ordered the Cacio e Pepe, Bucatini Carbonara, and Sausage Pizza.  The Cacio e Pepe was good, but I LOVED the Bucatini Carbonara.  This is one of the best things I've eaten in awhile and you need to order this.  It was super creamy and the bucatini was perfectly al dente.  The pizza was roman style, and I liked the flavor.  Not a must order, but if you are feeling pizza you could do worse.  We also ordered a side of squash, which I really liked.  It was nice and soft and I enjoyed the pepitas that came with it.  \n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed our experience at Tesaccio.", "This new spot is now officially one of my favorites! Regardless of COVID-19 going on they have exceeded my expectations! Service was amazing as well as the food! We got the whole spread of tzatziki & hummus with delicious soft bread! We tried all 3 of the skewers, consisting of the swordfish, steak, & lamb.. all three were cooked to perfection. Seriously. You cannot go wrong. To follow we ordered the Orecchiette Cacio e Pepe pasta & it seriously felt like we were on a side street in Testaccio, Italy. Delicious! On top of that we had the Moroccan Chicken which had crispy skin on the outside and moist juicy chicken on the inside which was no doubt some of the best chicken we've ever had. I cannot wait to make my next reservation! Definitely will be returning!", "Had a group dinner at Testaccio last night and we can't stop raving about how great it was. Each dish was so delicious, and the service was fantastic. We ordered multiple shared plates and each one was a hit. They have an autumn soup special that we started with, and I'll dream about it for the rest of my life. The artichokes were amazing. The tuna tartare was excellent and unique. I can't say enough good things about our experience at Testaccio! Can't wait to dine again, and try the sister restaurant Osteria Langhe!!", "Roman fare with beautiful interior in the heart of Logan Square. Before I get to reviewing the food, I will just point out a flaw that can be easily fixed. I came here on a Friday night for dinner with a long-lost friend who I haven't seen in a decade - so naturally, we had planned to chat the night away. The loud music in a packed restaurant made that quite difficult... in fact, at the end of the night, my voice was hoarse from having to scream at my friend to talk!\n\nOnto the food. The antipasto that we ordered were delectable - the burrata was beautifully presented and tasted great, and the fried calamari was crunchy on the outside but soft (with just the right amount of chewy texture) in the middle. We also tried 2 pastas - the cacio e pepe and the carbonara. In my opinion, the cacio e pepe is a must-try - fresh, creamy sauce that was not too overbearing - I could eat another plate! The carbonara, despite being wonderfully al dente, was too salty.\n\nI will probably come back again to try other dishes, and also to try dining in their beautiful (I hope heated) patio. But I hope the music will be less loud next time!", "I'm done with my work today so I decided to eat dinner in a restaurant. I haven't eaten lunch and I'm so hungry. I was here last month and their food was good. Their place was nice and clean. They also have a table outside if you want fresh air and a nice view.  I ordered chicken and some salad. Their chicken was too dry. I don't like it but its flavor was good. I like their salad. It's perfect for someone who loves vegetarianism. I ordered salad for takeout. My wife loves salad too. It came really quick. The staff was friendly and nice. They are so efficient in their work. When I'm home , my wife was so happy when I gave her the salad. She said she likes it. I highly recommend this restaurant.", "Nice to see a new place open in the neighborhood during these times. The whole dining experience was fantastic. Shortly after we were seated the owner came to describe the wine we ordered, as well as, just about every dish on the menu and how it is prepared. Started off with the spread dish which is a must in my opinion. Paired that with the tangine which had exquisite flavor and presentation.\n\nFor the main dish decided to try the carbonara pasta. It had just the right amount of richness and the pancetta was cooked to perfection. The restaurant itself is was very well designed. Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes and hopefully have room for some dessert.", "Hands down best Italian food in the city! I've been searching for quality authentic Italian food since moving to Chicago 3 years ago. I have finally found the Mecca .

The blue walls have paintings of ocean walls. Sit at one of the open tables and someone will promptly bring you a large menu.\n\nThe Chapin ceviche is a Guatemalan version that is presented in a metal bowl. Fresh diced cubes of raw shrimp, crab, and octopus are cured with lime juice until they are firm and succulent. Tender thin octopus slices and soft creamy avocado are layered on top. Tomatoes, onions, a hint of mint, cilantro, and Worcestershire sauce build upon the bright and distinct flavors. Sweet, salty, sour, what more do your taste buds need? There are crispy tostadas and crackers for scooping up the precious ceviche.\n\nThere are bottles of Tapatio at each table, but they'll bring you a yellow squeezes bottle with habanero sauce. The habanero sauce is neon yellow, tangy, and gives off a few sparks. They also sell the habanero bottles for $10 each.", "This place is one of the best places to get ceviche AND fish tacos!  Even though it's called La Cevicheria make sure to get an order of fish tacos (comes in pairs) or the shrimp tacos.  I prefer the fish since I love the contrast of texture from the crisp batter (it's so light and fluffy you can actually hear the crisp break when you bite into it) and the buttery texture of fish.\n\nAlso, if you're looking for something IN ADDITION to your ceviche get the Veracruz Fillet.  I've never had the veracruz shrimp but I'm sure that is delicious as well.  I love salty food and this will definitely give you a party for your tastebuds since there's a briny flavor from the capers and olives.\n\nMost importantly this place is BYOB.  You can't beat delicious cheap seafood with BYOB.\n\nAlthough people say this neighborhood is ghetto (I wouldn't say it's ghetto but maybe a poor neighborhood) it's totally worth it.\n\nMake sure to get there early though, the owners wouldn't give us extra tostada chips since he said they ran out.\n\nThe tres leches cake is pretty delish too if you have to satisfy your sweeth tooth.", "As an off-the-map-food-joint professional, i have to say, this place takes the cake. It is a little hole in the wall, cash only, and closes at 9pm on the weekends. There are 10 tables. And boy is the food fantastic. Best Caribeno stew I have ever had. We also ordered the seafood cocktail, Veracruz style, which was so perfect. The seafood was fresh, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. I was a little leery about the location, but the food is so worth it. If I lived in LA, I would eat here 4 times a week. If you're looking for amazing Latin-American flavored seafood, this is the place to go.

Try ONE DROP before going any further!  \n\n(There -- I've done my public service)\n\nThen, just to see what their hot food is about, we ordered a shrimp burrito.  More marvelousnesses!

Carolina gets down in the kitchen while Julio takes care of selling and persuading folks to go outside the box, especially with the bloody clam ceviche.

Wild caught fish with house batter and excellent dual sauce, perfect cream to citrus-spice ratio over the cabbage. Crisp shell and steamy, flakey fish.  Soft and thin yet robust tortilla selected.

The ambiance is cozy and private, perfect for celebrating a special event with your special someone. The steaks are stunning, perfectly aged and seasoned. If you're going to eat here, then treat yourself and get the dry aged bone-in ribeye. Honestly, it was more than enough for two. Cooked how a steak should be (medium rare) without anything fancy sauce or garnishes. Along with the steak, we ordered the thick cut bacon which was sinfully delicious and the crab cakes. The crab cakes took me by surprise, and I still dream about them. I realized every other crab cake I'd previously eaten was a joke, I couldn't possibly even put it in the same category. This crab cake was filled with thick chunks of fresh crab meat.

The fois gra duo and the blue cheese souffle (I think that's what it was) were both done quite nicely.  The duck breast (sorry if I don't remember the exact name and composition of the dishes because we tried 8 different restaurants in 4 days recently) was tender and juicy but just a bit overly gamy.  The signature short rib (about 4oz. worth of the bovine protein) was tender but I wish the dish had maintained sort of the theme of the dishes we had for the evening and incorporated some citrusy fruits or plums in the braising of the short rib to soften the heaviness of the meat.  In addition, at $49, it seemed overpriced; I can almost get a large piece of prime steak at Mastros for that price.\n\nOverall the food was good; but, it just seemed lacking a certain uniqueness for a restaurant at this price range.", "Finest dinner I've had. 5 Star food and service.

During covid, it is self park and also required reservations with limited seating for dine in, which made the night more enjoyable for me.  Less of a crowd, intimate setting and prompt service. I do believe they offer takeout.. but the dine in experience was so worth it. It was a prefixed menu and everything was cooked to perfection.. I had the chilled avocado soup with shrimp, braised short ribs (melt in your mouth)! and s'mores dessert.  I tried some of my friends miso glazed sea bass and it is one of the best sea bass I have ever had.. so amazing I will not be able to look at or eat another short rib or sea bass the same again.

Everything was fresh and tasty but unspectacular. I've had surprisingly good tuna tartares at Sbicca in Del Mar, Pacific Coast Grill in Cardiff and Nine-Ten in La Jolla, so I was disappointed with this dish.

For this reason, they informed us that if one person gets the daily spread, everyone at the table must as well.\n\nThe laffa bread came out hot and was seasoned nicely. It was a great base to eat each side with. We got multiple rounds of the hummus, mushrooms, artichoke dip, tahini, and the potato with almond spread.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the service was slow. We told 2-3 waiters which items we wanted replenished, but sat waiting for most of that time because they forgot. They came out with the bread after we reminded them, but we had no mezze spreads. We reminded them maybe 3 more times about which spreads we wanted again, but got full by the time they came. Despite this, we had a great time!

We walked in last night (Wed) at 8:30 and waited just five mins for a table (while down the street the wait was an hour).\n\nBecause it's a set mezze menu for $25 per person, we had our food almost immediately.  Of all the dishes, and there were a ton, my favorites were the white dip with almonds, the cauliflower salad and the baba ganoush.  There wasn't a bad dip in the bunch.\n\nWe also then ordered a meat dish- short ribs- that came with two sides.  The fava beans had a weird flavor, they weren't a win for our table but the other side was the couscous and it was delightful.  The short ribs were slow roasted and falling apart, also crispy and salty on the outside, and served on a huge bone.  They were EVERYTHING.\n\nI would absolutely return.

For $25 per person, this is a fun experience worth going for alone, even if you don't order any of the shared entrees for the table.\n\nI'll be back soon hopefully for lunch, which will offer something like an Israeli version of a bento box that sounds intriguing.", "Great Food, excellent service.

If I go there next time, I will stay with Laffa and the Mezes only. The serving is quite filling.\n\nI would have given Lamalo 5 out of 5. The 2 points shorted are due to bad acoustics and cafeteria setting. We did not like the room. The setting does not match the pricing. Will I return there? Yes, but not for a formal evening.

Very worth it as the restaurant took such an innovative take on asian cuisine such as the lobster three ways with the poached lobster, lobster sticky rice to a fried lobster claw (like a fried chicken drumstick). I would say the food leans heavier on the seafood.\n\nThe wine selection is great and there is a sommelier to help you with your choice.

I almost hope the word doesn't get out too much so I can pretend this is my personal hidden gem.\n    The omakase is a good deal for the $ but I prefer to cherry pick from the daily nigiri offerings flown in from the Japanese fish markets. The O toro and barracuda are just a few of the fantastic options you won't find at 99% of sushi joints. A must for me at any sushi restaurant is the sweet shrimp. More specifically the fried head of heaven and it doesn't disappoint at gintei.\n    The service here has always been perfect.  They are very knowledgable and willing to walk you through the sake menu.  Also the chefs have always been kind while breaking down the sushi list.

However, I really enjoy their straight-forward omakase and excellent service.\n\nI've dined at Gintei a dozen times and also enjoyed their takeout during the pandemic. Both experiences are great. I normally get nervous eating takeout sushi, especially nigiri/sashimi, but Gintei uses high quality ingredients that their food tastes almost as good eating it at home.\n\nI'm a big fan of their nigiri, especially anything with scallops, snapper and barracuda. Their omakase leans more towards the traditional side - minimal ingredients that makes each bite shine. You won't find - although I love them - truffle, foie gras, etc on any of their nigiri. Other menu items I enjoy is their chicken karaage (I'm a sucker for karaage) and fried shrimp heads.\n\nGintei has an impressive sake selection with a focused assortment of beers.\n\nThe owner Cole is awesome and so is his staff. I always feel right at home dining in or just picking up food.", "Gintei may be one of the best Japanese restaurants I've been to in the Bay Area--the decor inside is elegant and modern, and the food and service were both on point. Despite not having a reservation, we were seated right away in the small restaurant in the nondescript location.\n\nWe started our dinner with the omakase sashimi platter, which included cuts of red snapper, salmon, mackerel, and bluefin tuna--everything was fresh and delicious! We also had the delicious miso soup (which included mushrooms for more umami flavor), the short rib, the sauteed local mushrooms, and the somen noodle. All of these dishes were delicious, but the real standouts to me were the grilled mackerel (saba) and the grilled hamachi collar. Both of these were cooked perfectly and had delicious salty flavor that went so well with the meaty texture and aroma of the fish. Overall, an absolutely excellent dinner, and I would definitely come back for more!", "Michelin's review guide lured me here.\n\nProbably the best omakase I've been to so far. At $45, you'll get your first 10 pieces, best pricing in the bay. The fish they serve you, I don't think I've ever had it before. It is definitely not the regular salmon, albacore, or tuna. Each piece is quite exotic to me, maybe I'm just new to the game of nigiri. After the 10th course of chef's choice of fish, we opt for more and ordered whatever the chef recommended as \"special\" of the night as well as a few order of Hokkaido uni, and the geoduck. These are not on the menu but available that night.\n\nAll in all, the fish is VERY FRESH and most pieces have the melt in your mouth affect - the omg moment. Though, service can use some improvements (-1) at the price tag we paid. What a great find, would definitely return when time permits.", "It took me by surprise to find there is a lack of good sushi restaurants in this area of SF.   It certainly didn't install any confidence in me when I saw a string of 3.5* rated Japanese restaurants in this area.  Are the people too picky or is the sushi really mediocre?  \n\nUpon noticing the sushi counter when I entered, it was a quick decision to sit there. Glancing at the menu, I noticed a slew of sushi/sashimi options available from Tsukiji market in Japan.  I didn't go for the Omakase (about 45-60pp) b/c I could only sample limited fish from Tsukiji.  I had the horse mackerel, mackerel, amber jack, sea eel, and a bunch more.  The fish were fantastically fresh and the rice was very well prepared.  For a price point of 60pp (which can still go up easily to 80-90), I'd say this is a fantastic price for the quality you get.  Is this the norm in SF? That I cannot answer, but as someone from the DC area, I would be ecstatic to have a place like this where I live.  \n\nFor serious sushi lovers, I strongly suggest you not go with the omakase and handpick chef selections from Tsukiji.

Rather, the execution is on point and there is an integrity behind the cooking. As is typical of Japanese cuisine, the quality lies in the minute details of seemingly simple cooking techniques. The differing thickness of batter coating to match the ingredients. The temperature control of the frying oil. The preservation of water content in the ingredients. All these are minute details which testify the chef's mastery in his cooking. And on top of that, there is the whimsical nature of fusing Western ingredients with Japanese cooking techniques.

It's great here where they mostly will only have 8 people per hour, where you can truly enjoy the flavor and the atmosphere here.\nI made reservations few weeks before actually being here.  That's the rule here. and do book it fast because they will run out of seats very fast.\n\nFood: we had a more expensive omakasa set where we have 3 more choices of tempura. But before actually enjoying tempura, we have two appetizers- one soup and one salad. It's selected by season so you do have surprises if you come in different seasons. Their tempuras are exceptional - fried food is no longer greasy here. All things maintain their flavors and add a crunch base chewiness at the end. And I am amazed by shima a soup dish which is something I have never tried before but taste so good.\nDessert is a must here. Ugh red bean, red bean.

I was able to secure their outdoor bubble tent for 2/14. Anyone considering the bubble tent should totally do it! It was 70degrees inside with 2 heaters and an air purifier, and we felt so cozy and private even being ok the street in the East Village.\n\nWe each ordered a beer/glass of wine and enjoyed a bottle of sake with our meal - definitely the way to go drink wise IMO! The omakase is a great experience, and like everyone says - the tempura is a highlight. My favorites were the head on shrimp, scallop, and king crab.

It was paired with green beans, fingerling potatoes and salsa verde. The broccoli was really tasty because of the anchovy vinaigrette, roasted garlic, and toasted bread crumbs on top. Such a unique and exquisite way to eat broccoli! The turkey leg was probably the only item that didn't wow me as because it didn't seem much different than the turkey leg I can get at a fair.

What was so incredible about Orsay was its spectacular service. The bus boys, bartenders, waitresses and maitre'd all didn't miss a beat. The guest number grew from sixty to over ninety, but no one ever flinched. Any favor asked was met.

I couldn't help but keep going!\n\nMy favorite dishes was the pumpkin soup, lobster and truffle, and the dessert! The lobster and truffle had the perfect taste of seafood with a bit of a 'salad' twist. The dessert, Gianduja Cr\u00e9meux satisfied my craving for chocolate and the wafel streusel was like eating your favorite chocolate cereal with nutella ice cream.\n\nTry to get a seat next to the window if you can for lunch.

Unfortunately there was a large table next to us that was very loud and being very over served. Great way to ruin a quiet dinner.   Which it pretty much was. And the restaurant did not so much as comp a $5 decaf coffee after dinner.\n\nWe asked to move to the bar to finish our last couple courses.

We checked in on Yelp to receive their cheddar biscuits for free. Normally they are $9 and with the honey butter they were delicious. We shared the Salad of Garden Greens before our meal. My husband ordered the Wild Caught Petrale Sole and ate everything on the plate. I shared the Heritage St Louis ribs with my daughter and they literally fell off the bone and were delicious! There were plenty of leftovers of ribs. The macaroni and cheese was also cheesy and gooey and shared at the table. My other daughter ordered the Grass-fed Cheeseburger and crispy potatoes.

I was in Napa over the weekend and was unable to get a reservation ahead of time. After doing our last winery tour, I decided to call the restaurant to see if they had any last minute reservations and they did! My friend and I immediately rushed over to the restaurant to make our reservation. Immediately when we got there, it was like a Pinterest dream! Makes sense why there was a wedding going on just outside of the restaurant.\n\nWith the Yelp check-in, you get a free basket of cheddar biscuits which were delicious! Who doesn't love carbs and cheese?! Disclaimer: I'm definitely not a huge fan of pork - but for some reason, that's all I had on this trip! I ordered the porkchops and it was FANTASTIC. It came with broccoli, jalapeno grits, and an apple and fig compote to top it off. The pork chops were grilled to perfection and paired very well with all of the sides. Huge portions and the price was very reasonable considering we were in Napa!", "What a beautiful ranch and perfect for lunch and to spend a few hours.

It's really spacious with two stories but was half empty when I went on a Saturday prime dinner time.\n\nThere were 4 people in my party and we got the combo for 3 people plus the beef tartare, which turned out to be just enough to make us comfortably full. The combo came with aged tenderloin, dry aged ribeye, and marinated galbi.

The sushi rice and chestnut added so much flavor to the beef. I will for sure be back for this!\n\nMinus 1 star for the service. You would think the service for an expensive fancy looking restaurant would be good but nope, it took us a massive amount of effort to get the waiters attention every time.

It's definitely a lot of meat but I have a big appetite.\n\nAnother great thing about this place is that they have a full bar and serve soju, beer and hard alcohol      \n\nTheir food is great but their service is always lacking which is disappointing for a higher end Korean bbq restaurant.", "I think their space is too big. The tables upstairs were definitely majority empty. The entry is nice, the restaurant looks nice and the first floor was pretty full. The banchan was tasty, and there is a yelp check in for a free drink. I enjoyed what we ordered -the korean spicy braised short rib but I think I prefer bbq-ing over precooked. This place is not AYCE. There are so many places to try kbbq. I would say that this is a good place to check out, but I don't think it would make my regular spots list.

We were seated in a private room upstairs that had a fun vibe, cool art, etc.  \n\nThe food was above average - I would give it four stars but the service was below average.  All the BBQed meat was flavorful and solid quality.  They have interesting non-bbq dishes like the beef tartar sushi looking roll.  This was tasty but huge!  I think it could easily feed 5-6 people.  They also have yummy moon bean pancakes that I'd recommend.\n\nI think part of the problem with the service was they didn't have enough waiters.  We saw our waiter once or twice the entire dinner and had to wait a long time to order more food, have them fix the fan, get the check, etc.  There are other better BBQ places in Korea town but if they can improvise the service, this place could be great.

How far they've gone from the old.\n\nUsed to be my #1 recommendation for non ayce kbbq with the charcoal grills and the in house dry aged meats, but service has fallen a long way from what it used to be which is forgiven for post pandemic times, but from getting completely ignored multiple times, and the last 2 stops with the server burning our meat and instead of replacing the meat just picking off the burnt pieces it really just let's me know I can't really recommend this place anymore. Large combo and a few soju bottles came out to 383 after tax for 3 people.\n\nThe large combo has inflated from 160 to 199 and now a whopping 260. We can talk inflation, but the value itself here has come and gone. There are other places that probably deserve your attention more.\n\nI would say if you do come here make sure you come with a group. 5+ people you'll find more value here. Anything under you'll find better value elsewhere.\n\nYou honestly can't beat the flavor a charcoal grill gives you but if you do a search for just that you'll find an OG worth going to.", "Love this place so much.

Even though they advertise the rice bowl as \"mini\", it was a good amount and there were a ton of options to choose from.

Despite having \"soba\" in the restaurant name, we actually thought the rice bowls were much yummier.  We got our soba hot though since the weather has gotten pretty chilly, so perhaps their cold soba is better...I'll have to come back and see!\n\nOverall, Soba-ya is a solid spot in the East Village and an especially good alternative for when you go to Ippudo (just a few blocks away) and find out that the wait is 2h+.", "Highly satisfied with Soba-ya. The sake (salmon) sashimi was incredibly fresh and mouthwatering.\n\nOur party of 3 also enjoyed the ika meshi, which is squid stuffed with savory sticky rice. Thinly cut and served. I think we each would've enjoyed an entire order to ourselves. -Noted for my next visit.\n\nI had the fresh sea urchin with grated mountain yam dipping soba. So during this dinner I found out I was not a fan of Japanese mountain yam. The mountain yam tasted fresh but the lingering aftertaste just wasn't my plate of yam. The sea urchin was incredibly creamy and delicious.\n*Also the 3 different sizes does not change your uni portion, only the soba portion! I asked :)\n\nMy friends ordered the oyster soba and the nabeyaki udon. I personally didn't enjoy either. I found the oyster soba too be too salty and the nabeyaki udon to be too plain.\n\nI will like to come back for the special lunch sets! The appetizers are definitely a hit and must get.", "Soba-ya is the absolute real deal!!! Yes, Yelper, it is expensive. But this is honestly the most authentic experience you'll get for soba, stateside.\n\nI decided to go all out and ordered the uni tororo as well as the ikura oroshi soba. The uni tororo was super fresh. Plenty of uni in the portion. I was plenty full after the soba dish - the ikura giving way to a perfect balance of saltiness.\n\nThe service was obnoxiously polite - which I found charming and a bit silly at the same time. Staff is attentive to any needs you may have, and it's clear that the owner runs a tight establishment.", "First off, the outdoor sign is really cool and has an authentic feel. Inside, it's cozy but kinda tight spaced and the waiters are in Japanese kimono type clothing. My friend and I had to sit at the counter because there were no seats available but our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nI got the Nabayake udon which was about $18. I paid $26 including tip and tax. There were some chicken, tempura shrimp (it was really good! just the right amount of crisp yet the bite of the shrimp was yummy, meaty, and warm), tempura carrot, mushroom, other vegetables. I attest to other reviewers who say that the ingredients are fresh. I just think it's a little over-priced. I didn't care so much for the broth. Not my cup of tea. My friend got some soba thing. Hers was decent. It's not tasteless as some reviewers say. Overall, a good experience, but won't be running back here anytime soon.", "I really like this place. They have authentic soba noodles and their tempura batter is perfectly light and crispy. I tried their uni soba and their sea bass tempura along with their dinner special. The special is around $25 and includes soba, 2 shrimp tempura, side vegetables like pumpkin and two inari-sweet tofu skin with sushi rice stuffed in it. And also strawberry ice cream.\n\nIt's very clean and quiet environment."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/soba-ya-new-york?hrid=YrPYEpEd5zwthnngPFg_Iw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/soba-ya-new-york?hrid=kwKRN0Y7WfTlyHlHGbrppw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/soba-ya-new-york?hrid=C0rxvQhdXul6JoSdcxwa8A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/soba-ya-new-york?hrid=c8HlbTAciSrr64R_iZJ4Cw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/soba-ya-new-york?hrid=BpO_21hE1MLnlOJ6V8a_-g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/soba-ya-new-york?hrid=COxOV6xPUywuo1br7eSeTA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Glasserie", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/glasserie-brooklyn-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/glasserie", "michelin_pov": "Housed in an old glass factory, the beautiful Glasserie is colorful, rustic and industrial, with many original details, including a welcoming bar and small door that peeks into the bustling kitchen.

It's rabbit three ways, plus an outrageous array of side dishes that includes a green salad with fennel and mint, hummus with whole chickpeas and gorgeous olive oil, pickled vegetables, a yogurt dip, some dipping sauces, and flaky bread.  Good lord this is a fantastic dish, and it could easily serve three.\n\nI'm not sure what the portion size complaints are about in some of the reviews below.  We'll be back to sample more of the menu, but from what we had and what we saw going by, the portions looked perfectly ample.  As mentioned, the rabbit is ridiculously generous.  The ambiance is very brooklyn industrial chic, so maybe folks are expecting a casual couple small dishes to constitute a meal.  Not so, this place is elegant, and seems best enjoyed by splurging, ordering a bunch of stuff, and trying everything.", "I was lucky to have my birthday brunch at Glasserie. What I love most is the family style mezze feast menu which is a fun experience to share dishes with a large group. The $19 brunch included dishes ranging from grilled vegetables to fresh hummus. There was no shortage of food during the whole meal and they even bring extra servings of dishes that you enjoyed most. The dining room is beautiful with warm colors and a mix of seating areas that make you feel like you found a hidden spot somewhere far from Brooklyn. The service was great and they kept up with my large group. I wouldn't hesitate to return for another large group celebration or any weekend brunch.", "This is an easy, easy five stars. One of the select few we've come across in the New York. Top to bottom, solid joint. It's located on a cobble-stone sidewalked, industrial part of Greenpoint. Place used to be an old glass factory and it looks like a timeless piece of New York City.\nThe ambience inside just nails the vintage thing. It's a nice balance of being assembled as if it were another time without being \"hip\". Just a really comfortable and friendly ambience. Designed with a lot of thought and class.\nThe food was incredible. We came for brunch and it's very obvious that the chef is well-trained. Tons of complex flavors put on simple and classic dishes. The Mediterranean-inspired fare was flat-out just really good. I got the sunny eggs with lamb and my girlfriend got the lamb pies. Both were ridiculous.\nThe service was amicable and very attentive. Things moved very fast but in an efficient, not at all rushed way.\nFor sure worth the trek over. We will 100% be coming back for dinner.", "This place is amazing for lunch there is a traditional style Greek/Middle Eastern option that is similar to mezzes with about 10 different pickles and dips for the table and flat breads, this has never been the same twice and is always a little inventive in a good way. There is an option to add a main course to this that we usually do and take home.\nThe drinks are good and not over expensive, I discovered sour beer here that goes very well with the food, the reason I don't give five stars is that the service can be a little slow and thou I love this place it is rather noisy and does have a high percentage of the wonderful stroller crew, who seem to think that we must revolve round there world, for instance child being sick at the next table, no effort was made to shield us from this less than pleasant experience, a cloth napkin was used to clean things up and left for the server.\nOverall great experience but can be difficult to get a table for good reason.", "Griddle bread with labneh and pickled beets. One of the best things I've eaten this year. The griddle bread is piping hot but an amazing salty doughy mess that perfectly accompanied the soft cheesy labneh and micro greens with a molten spicy hot harissa oil core! The beets are only lightly pickled and so fresh, made all the more refreshing with their almond tahini sauce.\n\nAnd then the Chicken Liver Mousse is this rich pudding perfectly balanced with acidic tabouleh and refreshing cucumber and the insane pita with a million sesame seeds that just cover your fingers.", "Glasserie, pretty cool restaurant decor, nice space, located in the middle of nowhere.  Now throw in the fact that besides perhaps losing a kidney along the way to this restaurant, you'll now loose your wallet too!  Glasserie is a tapas style bar and prices their food so incredibly high that it would make people in Manhattan drop their jaws.  Do you like paying $15.00 for a carrot wrapped in phyllo dough?  Then this is the place for you.  Seriously.....the pricing is outrageous and the tapas are much to be desired.  A small rabbit three ways is going to set you back around $80.  Mind you that the rabbit is not all that it is hyped up to be.  Perhaps if you have rabbit maybe once in your lifetime, it will probably only be a novelty to you.  Granted none of the food was particularly poorly prepared, I had much higher expectations given the pricing.  I will say the rabbit was on the verge of being over cooked, the carrot is something to be avoided, and like I said, prepare to be gouged on pricing and leave hungry.  I'll leave this place to the hipsters.", "Visited this restaurant on a Saturday for brunch a few weeks ago and it was absolutely delightful. The decor of the restaurant almost reminded me of a wedding reception in a 1960s movie with a modern twist.

Pan-fried turnip cakes are simultaneously crispy and creamy, studded with bits of pork and mushroom.

That being said, however, the line moves pretty quickly and you can browse neighboring stores or the grocery market while you are waiting.\n\nThe quality and variety of dim sum options were pretty good. Nothing too special but my cravings for dim sum are satisfied here. Some of my favorite choices are the chicken feet and the egg yolk cream buns. I used to always get the turnip cake, however after my most recent visit, I have decided that it is too oily for my taste. Another item to skip is the flavorless congee, which is a shame because it is often ordered together with dim sum. When I visit MingHin with a group of people, the cost usually ends up being around $20/person (we eat a lot). My guess is that you can generally keep the cost lower than that.\n\nIf you are craving dim sum, MingHin is not a bad choice considering the other offerings in the surrounding area. While it may not leave any lasting impressions, it will do the job of filling your belly for a decent price.", "We were visiting Chicago, and after walking around in Chinatown, the few of us who are Chinese decided on this restaurant.  Because 1. It looks clean, and we would rather not be responsible for food poisioning  a group on business trip. 2.  It has a very nice color-photoed dim sum menu, so it's easier for the \"gwai lo\" to order.\n\nGlad we did, everybody walked out full and very satisfied, and the bill comes out very reasonable too.  \n\nThe Macaness BBQ Pork Belly was a bit hit - an orgasmic trio of crunchy skin, melt-in-your-mouth fat and flavorful meat.  So were the baked creamy egg-yolk bun, the pan-fried chive cake and the Xiao Lung Bao.  Even the ginger and scallion noodle was a hit.   It made for a fun time everybody passing around steamers and plates of food to sample and share.\n\nThe waitress was helpful in suggesting dishes off the regular menu for the vegetarians in the group (as dim sum is rather veg-unfriendly).\n\nMy only grip is that the place doesn't have bigger tables.  There is a private room but unfortunately it was not available, and all other tables sit a max of 10.  Kind of unexpected for a Chinese restaurant like this.", "The dim sum here is superb and I like the atmosphere better than the other place in Chinatown Square that seems like a banquet space. Like most dim sum places, you order from a menu with lots of little pictures and there is also an iPad to use. The food comes very quickly and is hot and fresh. The seating is very nice, lots of comfortable large booths. I would recommend skipping breakfast and coming here for lunch, famished and pig out. The food will hit the spot! The sesame balls are a must, but don't get the jumbo ones because they don't have any filling, unless that's what you're looking for. They have a few other locations that I haven't visited, one is downtown. There's sometimes free street parking a short walk away or metered spots more close by. Decent restrooms. Attentive service. Right next door to Lao Sze Chuan, another favorite for me.", "If there's ever a place to introduce a friend to the wonderous world of Dim Sum, MingHin located in Chinatown is the place to be. It's definitely seen a lot of hype and the crowds on a weekend translates to longer wait times. You will however be spoilt for choice at MingHin.\n\nIt's hard to list out all the dishes we ate since Dim sum is meant to be shared family style but I've listed some of my favorites below.\n\nSiu Mai and Har gow - The must orders of any Dim sum joint, these prawn style dishes come wrapped in a  transparent skin or in a yellow skin depending on which ones you order. The ones at MingHin come with a generous portion of shrimp and has that nice chewy texture.\n\nMacau style pork belly - A must have and probably the best out of all the places I've had this dish. The skin is crispy and you can dip the meat with some sugar that comes with the dish.\n\nLiu Sha Bao AKA Gooey egg yolk bun - A bun filled with a nice gooey custard interior. I usually opt for the one that comes with a nice crusted exterior for additional flavor.\n\nIf your friends are feeling adventurous, why not recommend they try out some chicken feet! It's another staple dish in Asia Dim sum that they can get to experience.", "First of all, they're open until 2am. Nothing makes me happier than knowing that I have dim sum options late at night. For someone who moved from SLC to Chicago, this is pretty exciting. Second, their service is great and super fast. And third, the food was really good - - no complaints about any of the dishes we ordered. You mark off what you want on a menu, rather than wait for a cart to come around.

Not your typical counter service taqueria, this one's pretty popular. Parking was difficult (although it should be much easier now), the line for adobada extended around the dining room and out the door, and seating was available for those lucky enough to catch someone leaving at the right moment.\n\nThe ordering system can be confusing for first-timers, each line is basically for a specific set of menu items. Convenient for some, a pain for others. So if you're in line for Chorizo, you'll need to wait in another line for Lengua. There are signs that will indicate which line to stand in.

It does have a bar and other small tables as well. The beer selection is good, a bit small, but good craft beer options. The service thus far has been very good, everyone is very friendly and they do a good job of making suggestions, explaining the menu, and making you feel at home. Great food, great beer, the smell of the place is of smoky bbq. Parking may be slightly difficult but not too much of a problem (street parking available on Taylor).\n\nPrice is okay. You will eat well but it'll run you anywhere from $10-$30 depending on sides, drinks, and entre", "Located in Little Italy is some of the best BBQ you'll find in Chicago. This was perfectly smoked meat with some stellar sides. I went with the local favorite, rib tips. It was a pound of pork rib perfection. Each piece was juicy, tender, and had a nice seasoned bark encasing the scrumptious morsels. Their spicy bbq sauce went exceptionally well with it. I got corn pudding on the side which is hard to describe. It's almost like a corn bread pudding. Regardless, it was delicious and something I would come back for. My friend was blown away by the smoked pastrami. I found the sweet tea to be a little weak, but otherwise this a joint showcasing the best of America's BBQ traditions including their very own.", "Came here once on a Tuesday, when they had a deal on rib tips.\n\nOrdered: rib tips, macaroni and cheese, and whiskey sour with grenadine\n\nDRINKS: The whiskey sour was made with fresh sour mix, and a very sweet simple syrup. It didn't come from a gun or a bottle. And the freshness showed. That was truly the best whiskey sour I've ever had. I mean, they really put so much effort into a drink that could have easily been a normal well drinks.\n\nFOOD: I Only had one rib tip, but boy was it good. I'm from Georgia, so I like good smoking and good barbecue. And this was very well smoked. You could taste the wood in the meat.\n\nThe macaroni and cheese wasn't really macaroni, it was rotini. I always like Mac and cheese with different types of pasta. I feel like it gives the dish more character. I'm pretty easily impressed. The cheese was light in color and thick. It had a very slight sour backtone to the flavor and it was delicious. I killed the Mac n cheese.\n\nSERVICE: the bartender was kind and I didn't have to ask to have my drink refilled, they were already on it.", "I placed an order by phone for pick-up.  It wasn't what I'd expected when I walked inside.  There were several people dining in, but it was quiet enough to hear a pin drop.  Kinda weird.  The transaction was simple.  I paid for my order, just as they were bringing out my grub. 15 mins as promised.  \n\nOnce I made it home, I was disappointed with the portion size of the sampler platter.  With fries, my order came out to $25.  The sampler included 1 chicken leg, 1/3 slab, 3 slices of brisket & a small hot link.  I was expecting a little more food for 25 bucks.  It definitely isn't enough to share.  Nothing in the platter really stood out.  Nothing was bad, but I wouldn't go out of my way to stop in again.  If you're a fan of Smoque, you probably won't be impressed with County.  The brisket was tender with a good garlic flavor, but had considerably more chew than Smoque.  The chicken leg was dry and bland.  The rub & bbq sauce used on the ribs was interesting in a good way.  The hot link was probably the best of the bunch.  If Smoque is a 10, County is a solid 6.5.", "Although I have tried many BBQ places, this place is definitely worth going. Especially on Taylor Street. You'll only find a few decent restaurants for brunch and dinner in my opinion and this is definitely on my list.\n\nUpon arriving to your destination, the entrance to the restaurant is pretty small. When I was waiting for my friend, I was unsure whether or not their waitress even knew I was there. It was a good 5 mins while standing there before they came along when my friend appeared through the door. That was a shame.\n\nWe were seated outback of the restaurant (spacious) given the fact, its behind the restaurant. How to imagine the place: a cute cloth resting on the table with a candle. Depending on where you're seated, you may be next to another customer.\n\nFood wise, I ordered the St. Louis Spare Ribs (Full). It's a big order, I thought I could share but even then there was lots of food leftover. Garlic Fries on point but wished there was more. My friend tried their special that night I believe it was Greens and the Maple glazed chicken. I would say it looked amazing. I was quite jealous but next time!\n\nAll in all, best restaurant to dine in for dinner on Taylor."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-bbq-chicago?hrid=oB56JHknkBbkpuqufw2GBA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-bbq-chicago?hrid=IdaDv4GJVv-pnZzFwlvFtw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-bbq-chicago?hrid=iNZwH2dA17uKnBET1qA0Ow&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-bbq-chicago?hrid=CSVn0ZQyDQr811xNimmO4Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-bbq-chicago?hrid=sWYp4_njfZdPla-L3Ser6A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/county-bbq-chicago?hrid=6uRv6gSY2brW4FvhLvpfJA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "The Charter Oak", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/the-charter-oak-restaurant-st-helena-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/saint-helena/restaurant/the-charter-oak", "michelin_pov": "Christopher Kostow\u2019s casual-cool retreat continues to be a well-regarded and rightly applauded Napa mainstay.

Olive oil was very special.\n-Cucumber from our farm// Galia melon, burnt cucumber vinaigrette, baby shiso leaves. This was one of my favorite and I'm thinking about this dish as I write this.

Sadly, the food and decor are a pale reflection of the way this restaurant used to be.  The menu is simple and unexciting, given the wealth of fantastic restaurants in the St Helena area.  The decor is cold and boring compared to the inviting, clubby atmosphere of Tra Vigne.  \n\nIn our experiences at Charter Oak, the service was perfectly fine, the food was certainly not bad, but overall there is just nothing to recommend the place now.  Tra Vigne was a million times better in every regard, and we were saddened to see it go.   In its place, we go now to Rutherford grill, goose and gander, farmstead, cook, just to name a few, all far more interesting places in food as well as ambiance.   If you'd never been to Tra Vigne, then maybe this place might be interesting to you, but really the boring decor and simple menu are just grossly overshadowed by so many other great dining options in St Helena that there is nothing to recommend this place.", "We had dinner here the weekend after Thanksgiving and had a great meal. We typically go to Farmstead across the street (highly recommend!) but decided to give The Charter Oak a try based on a friend's recommendation.\n\nThe standouts for us were the aged beef tartare that comes with milk bread (you must get this, trust me), the sturgeon with caramelized kimchee, and the mushrooms. Everything we ordered was good but those were the dishes we'd order again for sure. To be honest, I could probably eat a serving of the beef tartare by myself. They cook many dishes in the hearth, which adds so much depth to the flavors.\n\nOur server Ronan was great as well.

Bread was heavy and tough, but bowl of greens was unique and tasty.  Warm tomatoes and yogurt was different and interesting.  Main course(pork belly) was so greasy that it couldn't be eaten but side dish of potatoes was great.  Figs with cream was tasty as a dessert.

They have everything from fun mixed drinks to rare bourbon and rare Japanese whisky. Very eclectic bar that does not disappoint.\n\nI tried four different rolls to share and they were all uniquely flavorful. My favorite was the Una-Kyu, it was perfectly spicy and crunchy. I could have had three of these rolls for myself.\n\nThe next best maki roll of my selection was the Go Takara but it was really big just and the waiter said and it was kind of difficult to eat.

Let me start off with saying I absolutely love this restaurant but if you are an animal lover it's a bit hard because it is a hunting lodge atmosphere with animal heads and pelts as decor and if that turns you off this may not be for you. The employees are all wonderful and the last time we went we wound up with a small wait and one employee took us on a guided tour of the lodge and told us all about the history of it (and some possible ghost sightings) right up until our table was ready. The food is wonderful, I really enjoy the Pink Lady Apple Salad, Brussels Sprouts, Mary's Chicken Breast, and sorbet trio. If you're a more adventurous eater my father really enjoyed the Chef's Game Trio of Emu, Elk, and Bison. It's a beautiful place in a gorgeous location with delicious food, what more can you ask for?", "Nestled in the Santa Monica mountains, this quaint cabin-style interior dining establishment was a place in which I had always wanted to dine.  I'm a fan of fine dining and have done much of it.  Saddle Peak Lodge is old style.  Nothing wrong with that and I actually like it for that reason.  The food fell short of my expectations, though.  My date had the trio of game meats.  I had the buffalo steak.  Of the trio, two had the same glaze/light sauce that bordered on tasting burnt, as in over carmalization.  I was disappointed in my buffalo.  It was not as tasty and tender as buffalo steak I've purchased from Whole Foods.  And you don't get the whole steak - just 4 or 5 slices.  The accompaniments didn't live up to the menu description.  I love salt, but everything was very salty.  The creamed kale that came with my entree was so creamy and little kale that it was too rich to eat more than 1 or 2 bites.  The potato accompaniment was salty and dry.  I left with no desire to return.  I would come back to visit the quaint bar if it were not for the expensive valet charge to park your car a few feet from the door.  They need to revamp their menu or change chefs, or both.", "Finally, we've found a rustic spot in Los Angeles that is reminiscent of our summers in Door County, Wisconsin. Nestled in the hills, the outdoor patio is spaced well for social distancing and the interior (currently closed) is snuggly Lodge motif with antler chandeliers, stone walls and log cabin walls. We had the fresh trout which was flavorful served alongside an acorn squash that was so yummy I even ate the skin. Our martinis were brought to the table in a shaker so we could enjoy every sip without half if it spilling between the kitchen and our table. Service was top notch. Total for two was $249 including tax and an automatic 20% service fee (worth it!). This included two beers, two martinis, one appetizer, 2 mains, 1 side, and 1 dessert to share. Too expensive to make it an every weekend kind of place but certainly great for special occasions or a mental getaway from the city!", "This place is nestled in the hills between the valley and Malibu. It is a really pretty drive. A very romantic place. A great date place, IF she doesn't mind looking at animal heads while dining....just something to consider. wink wink\nAlthough there is a vegetarian meal on the menu, I would NOT recommend this restaurant for vegetarians. The veggie meal is very cheesy. They do have some delightful sounding veggie choices for appetizers, asparagus, butternut squash soup, and a few other veggies. It is true to it's \"LODGE\"; name with stuffed deer, antelope, duck & various other animals all over. It is interesting... like a museum.\nI got the Halibut! on a bed of Lentils, a little potato and warm green grapes! Mmmm so yummy with a nice glass of Chardonnay! Mike and Gav got the Buffalo which I tried. Pretty Dang good! And Rick got the venison, also good, but the buffalo was more to my liking. Go figure! They have a nice website & the menu changes. It's an interesting place to visit & nice for special occasions as it is pricey. It's worth it though, the service is spot on & the food is 5 star. It also has a lot of history.", "So I haven't done a review in a while but last night I had the best corn bread I've ever had. Or the best in recent memory. Here, at Saddle Peak Lodge... my boyfriend and I enjoyed a very very very yummy meal. The ambience was fabulous. There are twinkle lights and the cabin is deep in the Calabasas mountains. You don't even feel like you're in California. I'm a vegetarian so you may think \"what did you eat at a steak house?\" Well.... I had tons of delicious options to choose from. I ordered the Carmel Apple cocktail, 2 actually. Dripping Carmel on the glass, so yummy and unique. We had cornbread to start. It tasted like dessert it was so delectable. For my starter I had the tomato and burrata as well as the most unique portobello fries. For my entree I had a delicious veggie ravioli. Truly everything was superb. I love history so I love that Clark Gable used to visit this restaurant. The only down side for me was the taxidermy but I understand it's a restaurant known for meat, so we will overlook that. This is a place to. Celebrate and to have a romantic night. Please try it! 10/10 on the customer service...", "Good food an even better ambience!

This is no Monterrey, but they encapsulate the essence of central Mexican cuisine.\n\nI ordered the tacos de nopalitos and the huaraches (!!) with a tamarind jarritos. The tacos come in the traditional double tortilla style. Tortillas can make or break a dish, and they were the perfect size and texture- they didn't break apart. If there's too much filling, separate the tortillas and turn them into two little tacos. Huaraches are so rare to find in the states in my experience, which is unfortunate because the masa based dish with goodies on the top is delicious! Everything tasted fresh and like home.\n\nOur server was very accommodating, always checking in on us and gladly explained the differences between the four salsas they had when brought to us. I recommend putting a little of all of them on everything... if you're adventurous.\n\nThe setting was simple- nothing fancy. Tables placed closely with one another, not uncomfortably. They added a more intimate vibe.\n\nIf the restaurant has a mix of Spanish and English in the air, it's likely the real deal, like this one. I'll definitely be back.", "I love this place- it reminds me of the beloved mom and pop joints that churned out the best Mexican food that made living in Arizona tolerable for so long.\n\nTaqHab is probably the best value in town-not to mention how crazy delicious the tacos, enchiladas de mole poblano and perfect margaritas are. Kind of shocking in DC to have big flavor, taste consistency and value so solidly define a place that continues to knock it out of the park for years now...\n\nThe tacos al pastor are tender and salted just right- a perfect partner to bits of sweet pineapple...the heat and citrusy shrimp mix heavenly with slices of avocado in the shrimp taco and the outer handmade tortilla always has a longed for bit of crunch from the griddle. The enchiladas de mole poblano hit just the right amount of heat with the subtle layers of chocolate and fruit and dozens of other ingredients in the sauce. And the beans and rice- our family could dine on these two incredibly delicious items alone.\n\nChef Dios Mio and crew serve up some of the best food and drinks in DC. Go early if you can-even now on weekdays- to avoid the long lines.", "I love this spot! Its one of my favorite authentic taco spots in the city. So good that I've been here multiple times pre Covid and recently stopped by. The staff wears masks and have tables 6 feet apart. I usually get the chips with guac, carnitas, chorizo, al pastor, barbacoa, bistec and lengua tacos. Something about the seasoning and the way they cook their meats/seafood has me coming back all the time. As for the drinks, I always get the mezcal hibiscus margarita, mayan mule or Mexican mojito. They focus on puebla style cooking so expect a little bit longer for the cooking, but expect strong flavors and your food to come out right every time. Parking here is very easy as I always find street parking in the front. The seating indoors can be a bit tight for some, but they also have outdoor seating. The service is always great as the staff knows the current specials and whats ingredients are fresh. If you want some authentic tacos and great drinks this is your spot!", "A group of 9 of us went on a Tuesday night and we were able to push 2 tables together while still leaving plenty of seating for other diners. As a vegetarian I ordered the mushroom tacos (not on the menu but they are always available) and green salsa chilaquiles (I was told the red salsa was spicier) - both delicious! Half of our group ordered the chicken enchiladas and they disappeared faster than our tacos did. For the spice lovers at the table, everyone was a fan of the spicy orange sauce and milder green sauce that is available on request (the spice tray also included pickled onions and another sauce).\n\nWith great service, delicious food and the proximity to Red Derby and Lyman's tavern (the restaurant doesn't have a liquor license, not sure if they have applied for one), we'll definitely be coming back for more tacos and enchiladas!", "Possibly the best Mexican street taco restaurant in the DMV.  The tortillas are made fresh on premises and to order. I poked my head in the kitchen and saw fresh shrimp and pulpo (octopus).  Nothing frozen here! All fresh.  \n\nTaqueria Habanero is owned by the husband and wife team of Mirna & Dio Montero.  The duo came to the DMV 14+ years ago and after working at a slew of restaurants, including for Jose Andres, the couple opened Taqueria Habanero inspired by the street food of Puebla, Mexico.\n\nWhen you walk in you feel that you are at home. That this is authentic.  That abuela is in the back working on the mole and tia is diveigning the shrimp.\n\nWe started with chips and guacamole. The chips were so crisp and the guacamole was home made.  I Jade three tacos: bistec (steak), cochinita (pulled pork) and the best: pulpo (octopus).  All were delicious and so filling.  I only needed three, but you can do so much more!  And did I mention, the price? The cheapest in the district.

Within minutes, you'll be ordering tacos and their house margarita. I ordered the shrimp tacos, pork tacos and beef tacos and the shrimp tacos won!

Culinary high points were the birds nest soup, salt and pepper crab, whole roasted chicken, honey baked sea bass, 5-grain stone pot rice, and anything with beef.  Some dishes like honey walnut prawns, although amazingly well executed, can be ridiculously small portioned at $20+.   Totally skip the pre-ordered crispy chicken with stuffed glutinous rice.

Pastas are, of course, made-in house and the specialty is no doubt the tajarin, a plate of deliciously eggy noodles twirled high with a savory rag\u00f9. Other regional specialties include hand-pinched ravioli stuffed with la tur cheese as well as prosciutto-wrapped rabbit loin.", "yelp_reviews": ["A great intersection of fine dining, comfort food and authentic italian cuisine.  It felt like we were in Italy for a 2 hour dinner made by my friend's grandmother, some of our favorite dishes were so simple, one of those cliches where \"the ingredients spoke for themselves\" rings so true in this case.  The homemade pasta with a simple tomato sauce, however boring that sounds, really was perfection on a plate and displayed the greatest possible potential of those few ingredients.  There are other dishes that were more complex and layered with flavor (most of them actually) and out of the 8 dishes we ordered, each one of them seemed better than the next, with our favorite probably being the gnocchi for a first course and the prosciutto wrapped rabbit for the second.  The waiter was very attentive and welcoming, he seemed to be very involved and have a real passion for the menu (quite possibly the owner?).  Both him and the kitchen were quite accommodating to our friend who had a severe dairy allergy, as difficult as that might be.  Overall, it was a great experience.  Pricier than your typical neighborhood Italian restaurant, but the quality and experience are well worth it.", "I was very impressed by this restaurant. We found out it was recently opened in May 2014. The owner talked with us for a little about the roots of the restaurants menu. He was very passionate about the food as well as his native country, Italy. The staff was extremely attentive and helpful as well.\n\nWe tried the Polipo, which is grilled squid. It had phenomenal texture and tasted delightfully light and summery. For my main course, I had the tajarin, which is a type of Noodle. It was prepared with brown Butter and sage. Again, an outstanding dish with tons of flavor. My husband had the rabbit with pork belly, which he was also quite impressed with the wonderful texture and flavor. For dessert we had the semi freddo, which had the most delightfully rich cherries I've ever tasted.\n\nThis place was truly enjoyable. It has a great outdoor patio space as well as a welcoming interior. The wine selection was a perfect amount for the size of the restaurant. The waitress allowed me to try two wines since I was unsure of which to choose. We will definitely be returning for more outstanding dishes and service.", "My best friend would always rave about how good the pasta here is so we came here for her birthday and had a fantastic meal from start to finish.\n\nWe ordered their several pasta dishes to share but the star of the meal was the plin. Hand pinched petite ravioli stuffed with creamy la tur cheese and tossed in thyme and butter... do I need to say more? Each bite was so indulgent and rich, yet the ravioli itself is supremely soft and light. The ragu was also very delicious! To be honest, I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu here. I appreciate their use of local and seasonal ingredients. They do a wonderful job all around. Oh, and their wine list is a plus too!", "Stopped by Osteria Langhe on a Saturday night. Normally the restaurant does have lots of bar seating that fills up fast but we had a reservation so we were seated promptly. The feel of the restaurant is cozy and elegant. The waitress was very warm and helpful, gave lots of good recommendations to how to have a well rounded experience. We started with the carne cruda which is a nice antipasti with raw beef tartare and crackers. The waitress gave more crackers when we ran out for free. Then we had the cauliflower flan which was absolutely delicious, I highly recommend as it was the highlight of the night for us. The flan tasted very much like a quiche with soft lightly buttered cauliflower inside. For primi and secondi we shared the plin, which was a tasty ravioli with three cheeses including a goat cheese that provides a tangy zesty flavor to the filling. For secondi we shared the pesce, a delicious roasted sea bass with delicious cauliflower and potatoes in a citrus basil cream. Overall our experience here was excellent, the food was delicious, and we'd definitely come again!", "Tightly focused menu for both food and wine. The service is always excellent, and the food is incredible!  Lucky to live so close to this little neighborhood gem. I started dining here when they first opened, and I would walk by with my dog and notice they weren't busy-- nobody knew how good they were yet.  I'd sit on the patio with my Doberman and eat dinner alone. I say \"eat dinner\" but what I mean is \"indulge in a slew of delicious plates, one at a time, with wine pairings guided by the wine god, Aldo\", who would also occasionally keep me and my dog company.\nThe menu is seasonal, but the Plin Is a staple and shouldn't be missed.  \nThey now offer interesting pop up wine tastings, and specials like their Champagne happy hour every Thursday, or their Trifecta Tuesdays (3 courses prix fixe)... all of which get posted on their social media.\nThey're the little but mighty Italian spot that somehow has managed to stay humble and true to its friendly neighborhood roots amongst all the acclaim.\nDefinitely worth the try!", "I haven't stopped raving about the the magical night I just had at Osteria Lange. From the moment we walked in, our Italian server who was fantastic, the decor, the drinks and of course-our main course, the food.\n\nThere is no reason you wouldn't order the plin. Little pillows of pasta delights. Stuffed with Cheese and can I have more? As a bonus you can walk out with a bag to cook at home.\n\nGnocchi was quite heavy after the plin but vet savory and creamy.\n\nMy husband devoured the rabbit wrapped in prosciutto!\n\nBeautiful dinner and on Sundays it's all you can eat pasta!

They do Beer Flights of 5 for $15 which is always fun to get to try a bunch of types. I will definitely be back once brews rotate out a bit to try new beers that enter their repertoire.\n\nThat being said, I did enjoy the food greatly. They do a fantastic job preparing melding Asian & American flavors with dishes like the Chicago Beef Bao for $14, prime rib and Szechuan giardiniera in a soft bao bun.

I booked a table for 6 on the rooftop for my birthday.\n\nWe were seated promptly and our server came by quickly to introduce us to the menu and describe some of the beers.\n\nThe beers were great.  Easy-to-drink bases with interesting flavor additions that matched their cuisine.  I would describe the food as Chinese fusion.  Traditional dishes with an upscale twist.  Our server was great at answering questions about the dishes and giving guidance on portion sizes.\n\nI ordered the Yibin Style noodles and very impressed!  Tons of flavor and tender noodles.  A little too much sauce but I was happy to take home the leftovers to put over rice later.\n\nSeveral people ordered the Pork Belly Chow Fun.. and if I had been hungrier, I would have ordered it as well.  The pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth tender.

He took it like a champ!\n\nTheir dining room is closed now for the rest of the year but we'll be back to order beer and food for takeout!", "Overall: Bixi Beer provides a fresh option for boozy brunches and group-style dinners.\n\nThe good: They brew their own beers which are actually really tasty. They cover all the bases - sours, ales, lagers, stouts, each one great. Plus, you get a free check-in from one of their drafts. The atmosphere is sophisticated with white tiles and black accents but the vibe and food offerings don't necessarily match, which is a very good thing. I loved the plant accents as well, which brought the tone down. As for the food, it's typically a dim-sum kind of fashion, but our table did a more \"get your own meal\" and everything was great. Drunken noodles, eggs, fried rice, it was all hot and flavorful.\n\nThe not-so-good: A little pricy and the seating was a little uncomfortable for our particular booth, but neither are much to complain about. And, the house-made sausage wasn't particularly to my liking.\n\nFood/drink: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nService: 9/10", "No expense was spared when it came to the decor of Bixi. Beautiful fixtures, 2 living plant walls, a retractable roof, an inviting parlor right out of a Kubrick movie - taken all at once, very impressive and massive. Downstairs is more casual, whereas upstairs has a classier vibe.\n\nThe beer options are light and refreshing with interesting flavor notes. However, the food was sub par. I was excited for the idea of a Chinese inspired brewpub with food. Anyone looking at the menu is sure to order the scallion pancake because you think it'll be lightly fried and delicious. Instead what came to us was dense and awful.\n\nThe sticky eggplant bao was the only item I thought was good. The long bean was overly flavored and the belt noodle yibin was greasy, overly flavored and overcooked. In general, it's what I'd expect from Chicago Chinese takeout. If you know what good Chinese food tastes like, you'd find this unacceptable.\n\nStop in for a beer but pass on dinner.", "I really wanted to love this place but unfortunately it really fell short.  I read all the great reviews of the upstairs space and was disappointed to learn it didn't open till 5, even on weekends.  The full menu wasn't available till five either.  The bartender was not very friendly and when I inquired about the IPA, she replied \"it's basic\",  She's right it was.  I wasn't a big fan of the pale ale, it tasted too much like fruit juice and not enough beer to it.  The full menu came out at 5 and it seemed overpriced and small.  There were only two noodle dishes.  We left to try something different.  There is no parking due to construction for two blocks in front of restaurant, just a heads up.", "I absolutely adore this place and am so happy to have it in the Logan square neighborhood. I'm not normally into Asian fusion restaurants but the food here is so delicious. Standouts to me have been the shrimp and crab dip, cheeseburger bao, miso blondies with their sweetcorn soft serve, but the number one thing you must try are their yibin noodles!! The yibin noodles are made in house, and they are the fat chewy yummy kind of noodles, the sauce is a little on the spicier side, and the flavor is out of this world!"], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/bixi-beer-chicago-8?hrid=zyLinqTNiwwGFBQtNLYb8A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bixi-beer-chicago-8?hrid=bELK3jfORTacBs1lf3hByQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bixi-beer-chicago-8?hrid=grzdnCnml722JDaEORaj0g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bixi-beer-chicago-8?hrid=sBYaF9EhI4c1MSJPzFvMdg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bixi-beer-chicago-8?hrid=6gy8fA5673yXD8OgkoXx_g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/bixi-beer-chicago-8?hrid=1_j5aWjG_hPAUfGZaSLIcw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Ayara Thai Cuisine", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/ayara-thai-cuisine-los-angeles/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/ayara-thai-cuisine", "michelin_pov": "Unless you're heading to LAX, this culinary retreat may seem out of the way, but in reality, family-friendly Ayara lures diners from far and wide.

The fact that it was bustling with business was a good sign. I played it safe and ordered the pad Thai with chicken which was just better than okay. I felt it needed a bit more of a kick of flavor, so I added the hot sauce to turn it up a bit. The service (which pushed this review to 4 stars) was OUTSTANDING!\n\nOur server always appeared at the right time and before she would leave our section she would turn to give a glance to be sure that no one was in need of a refill or whatever.

It gets pretty crowded so you may have to wait a bit and the space may look small but it's actually quite large - it has 3 seperate dining areas all connected but unless you go the restroom you may not even know there's more in the back.   They're great for the classics like pad thai, Tom yum goong, drunken noodles, etc, but I highly recommend you try something different because those dishes are some of their best they have a beef salad type dish that has mint in it and it's just so flavorful refreshing and just plain yummy.  their curry dishes too are so good and they are constantly updating their menu with special items.  This last weekend they had a thai version of grilled cheese and tomato soup since it is national grilled cheese month, but the soup was thai flavors and  their Valentine menu is a great one if you get a chance to go one year I recommend making a reservation.", "Food: Was excited to try their boat noodle and duck noodle specials. Overall decent light flavor and good presentation. Although there was not enough veggie toppings for your soup (cilantro, green onion, bean sprout, sauces) and for $9 a bowl, it was not as filling as expected for a noodle soup. **Also, they were out of sticky rice so missed the opportunity to try the larb salad and the sticky rice mango with coconut. Boo!\n\nService: Be ready (with steeled patience) to wait 15 minutes or longer for your order to arrive from the kitchen. Noodle soups took some time to come out even with only four other tables occupied during the slow dinner hour on a Sat evening (4pm).

Plenty of injera was set out on the table for you to tear off pieces and grab bitefuls of food.\n\nMy friend suggested I try the ZILZIL TIBBS (#8), chunks of beef seasoned with garlic, black pepper and purified butter, seared over a hot charcoal grill, and then brought out on a sizzling iron plate.  It came with a small green salad of lettuce and tomatoes.  The beef was so tender and flavorful.  I sampled my friend's VEGETARIAN COMBO, which is one pretty platter.  Reminds me of an art palette.  Everything I tried on it was good.  If there are two of you, getting these two dishes is an excellent way to go.", "I am shocked that no one has rated this place yet. I found out about it because a friend of mine raved about it.\n\nI was a little unsure because it doesn't even look open from the street. It is hidden away on a block with repair shops and such. The decor is not what you go for, but the food is amazing.\n\nI should have mentioned before that it's an Ethiopian restaurant. I had never had Ethiopian before I went. It's so good! For those who don't know (which I didn't), you eat with your hands using bread to scoop up the various dishes. My husband and I went with another couple and we ate communally.  I have been racking my brain for the names of the dishes we ate, but I can't remember. I know one thing was a kind of vegetarian platter and then there were two meat dishes which you dip into the veggie goodness.\n\nThis is the kind of place that you want to bring your friends to because it makes you look unbelievably hip.

The line I stood in during lunchtime moved excruciatingly slowly, but it was worth it for Corazon Cocina's amazing food. Their location in the Santa Barbara Public Market seems perpetually busy, but it's the perfect setting for enjoying the fresh, vibrant, balanced flavors of the food.\n\nI started with the mole con pollo taco, which came with tender shredded chicken, a black almond mole, and cheese on a homemade corn tortilla. The flavors were so deep and delicious--it was really put over the top with the selection of spicy and fragrant salsas from the salsa bar; there was also plenty of pico de gallo, lime, and even an awesome peanut sauce to boot! I also had the amazing Norteno taco, which came with cooked-to-medium skirt steak, oaxaca cheese, guacamole, and beans on a chewy, buttery homemade flour tortilla. The steak was so tender and flavorful, and each of the components of this creatively-assembled taco worked so well together. Seriously some of the most clean and delicious tasting tacos I've had in a while!\n\nWhile not cheap, the tacos here are definitely worth the price, though make sure to bring your patience as well. This is definitely a food stand to come for at the Public Market, and I would love to try more of their menu!", "At last, a Mexican food restaurant in Santa Barbara  I am looking forward to returning for more taste testing. The quality of the ingredients are fresh combinations of homemade delight. We had the sushi grade tuna in a red spicy sauce with watermelon, pomegranate seeds and persian cucumber, alongside homemade chips and avocado. Adding the pickled red onions was a plus. Our second dish was lime marinated white shrimp - meaty, not the usual rubber found in town- with mango, jicama, tiny, flavorful red tomatoes, persian cucumber, and more homemade chips with avocado. Our dishes were flavorful, light, healthy and large portioned. Looking around at what others ordered, there is something for everyone including grilled chicken (Mary's organic) and meat tacos, platanos and black beans. The bowl of Mexican rice looked authentically sublime. It appeared the owner was the woman handing out the final trays of food. That kind of quality control was reassuring as so many restaurants start out with a decent plate of food and it gets messy down the road. Sitting at the bar is fascinating watching the food being prepared in well orchestrated fan fare. I was impressed. Line was long, and food came out fast.

He brings to the table technique and precision that are often not associated with Mexican food such as Japanese, Mediterranean, and even the Middle East!

His plating is well executed considering that his ware consists of paper and plastic, where one cannot wipe off mistakes. If not have to do it again.\nRam\u00f3n invests heavily in Santa Barbara's Farmers Market, and has calibrated his wine by the glass list to complement ingredients when they peak.

The carne asada taco is huge, so I could have just eaten that and a few bites of the ceviche and be full. The al pastor was smaller than the carne asada and has just as much flavor.\n\nThe ceviche bowl should be shared because it's a filling size, otherwise it's good as a single entree.", "I would say this is a hidden gem, but the locals are all over this place - and for good reason. Tucked away in the Public Market, the set-up is the same as pre-Covid: order at the counter, get a beeper, find a spot to eat. They don't have any of their own seating, but now there is a beautiful parklet to take advantage of.\n\nWhile the food takes a while and there is almost always a line, it is one of the top 3 restaurants in town for flavor, in my opinion.

Ordered the tofu with chili oil (instead of chicken), lion's head (pork and salted egg - like a meatball), soup dumpling and shanghai thick noodle (basically udon). This was for 3 people. Food came out pretty quickly but the first thing I noticed was how small it was. One person could eat a dish and still be hungry. Entrees were on average $14-16.\n\nThe food itself was delicious though! Definitely recommend the Lion's Head!! They have the traditional soup dumplings and the one where it's a giant one with a straw. It's a cool experience but would not recommend getting them for consumption. There's not a lot of meat in it, the meat isn't very good but mostly the soup dumpling skin is way too thick. It's more of a bun texture. Aside from that, would definitely recommend this place if you're craving something fancy but authentic!", "This was a totally awesome discovery!!!  My friend was telling me about soup dumplings and how good they are.  I have had pot stickers before and wasn't sure what the difference was. We didn't feel like going to Chinatown so I looked on Yelp and found this gem.  It was a Saturday night and the place was crowded. There is a very cool vibe to the decor.

So cool to watch then put them together so quickly and beautifully.\nI had the Moulin Rouge cocktail which I really enjoyed and my friend had the Adorable Woman.\nWe weren't sure how much to order and the server helped us out. With a Yelp check in you get a free glass of wine that was actually good.\nWe ordered crab soup dumplings (DIVINE), pan fried pork buns(DELISH), and a scallion pancake (YUM) for appetizers. All were wonderful!\nWe ordered two mains   Black pepper beef and macadamia and the Typhoon Shelter garlic shrimp.

We shared a few different plates and the bartender was happy to provide information on each of the dishes. For appetizers we had the marinated beef and marinated cucumbers. They were okay, nothing too extravagant. We then also had the pork soup dumplings, the chicken dumplings with chili oil, and the Chinese sausage fried rice. These three things were absolutely delicious and I look forward to trying again. To drink we each just had a glass of wine on happy hour, also with a generous pour when the bottle was almost empty.\n\nI look forward to coming back and hopefully trying some other soup dumplings but hope to sit at a table!", "Solid spot in the neighborhood that will definitely draw comparisons to Cafe China given the cuisine and proximity.\n\nCame here on a weekend for dinner around 7 and there was a short wait for our party of 3. Looks like they were a little short staffed for the amount of people that were there and it took a while for them to wipe down our table before we were seated.\n\nIn terms of food, ordered the soup dumplings, eggplant, chicken with hot chili, pig ears and cumin lamb. The plates came out looking kind of small considering the prices ($16+ per entree) but ended up being enough food. The chicken was tasty but ended up being a lot of pieces of chili and peanuts and not a lot of meat. Seemed to be the case with the lamb as well.\n\nOverall a decent place in the neighborhood but some may be disappointed by the relatively small portion sizes and prices on the high end. But a good substitute for cafe china with much shorter waits", "Ambiance, design, homey, and great service, exactly how a classy Chinese restaurant should be! We came for an early dinner on Sunday with a reservation and was welcomed into a bright open space with a nostalgic telephone booth design. We sat in the back next to the chef making soup dumplings, which are clearly the highlights here. The crab version had a perfect thin skin and well flavored filling that is not too salty.\n\nThe other favorites included Steamed Whole Bass (tender, light soy flavor with thinly cut scallion), Lion's Head (with salted egg mixed inside and in the sauce, which mixed so well with rice that made us overload on carbs).\n\nAlthough the Hot Oil Eel stir fry didn't seem like traditional Shanghainese, it was well flavored and fresh (wish there was more eel though). The preserved tofu water spinach is a good unique veggie dish. Finally Honey Kaofu is also a great app.\n\nAlthough each dish is pricier than standard Chinese places, portions were big enough such that the split per person price was a reasonable $34.", "High quality, tasty, authentic Chinese food in Murray Hill!

Hands down the most impressive appetizer I've had in a while. Shaved black truffle and parmesan cheese shreds over parmesan ice cream on a light pastry. It was quite savory and refreshing for my palate. I absolutely loved the blue cheese toast served with the steak tartare. Both were solid winners. For the entrees, I was a little disappointed that both swordfish and prime hanger steak were charred very black. I'd appreciate more attention to plating the meats before they become carcinogenic. The kitchen must have been swamped trying to serve up to the high volume of orders during restaurant week. I'm curious to drop by sometime in the future to taste the quality of their steaks.

It is not overly fatty either. Definitely a highlight in appetizer.\n\nWe tried three different cut at RPM, each is cooked as it should. The hakkaido snow beef presents with itself an extremely tender texture and very rich with a mouthful of beef fat. IMO it may not be the best cut for steak as it is a but too creamy and rich. The mishima tomahawk is extremely tender, it is fatty and rich and everything expected from a good ribeye. The highlight to me was 120-day dry aged ribeye. It shows deep red in color and very tender in texture. Upon biting, you will notice the lack of juice in the beef while maintaining its tenderness. On the nose, it does have a long dry-age steak's smell.  \n\nThe pistachio creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was very enjoyable with the delicious pistachio flavor in each bite.\n\nThe gentleman servicing our table paid great attention and requires merely an eye contact or nod to come over to help.\n\nOverall, the price for top class steak is justified by its product and outstanding service.", "We were promptly seated at a comfortable round table that was on the second level overlooking the restaurant.

I've only been for brunch where the dishes offered tend to be more classically Indian than some mentioned by other Yelpers. The free champagne (or mango lassi) definitely adds to the experience at this weekly Sunday offering.\n\nI have to say I always feel a little uncomfortable by the British Raj decor. I really shouldn't as it is run by Indians and the Indian clientele seem quite happy here. Nonetheless, Bombay Club strikes a nice balance between formal and casual for their brunches. While the service and setting are striking and formal, many people there were dressed down. The bottomless champagne, excellent cooking, and sumptuous kheer are unbelievable, maybe less so than the $20 bill you pay for it all!", "An outstanding Indian restaurant! I've been eating Indian food for many years and this has to be one of the best.\n\nThe ma\u00eetre d' was somewhat off-putting but my waiter more than made up for it.\n\nI started with the Masala Crab - succulent pieces of crab with subtle spices (fennel seeds, cilantro,..) and onions. Next up was the Ajwaini Trout - grilled carefully, also with excellent and subtle spices. The skin was deliciously browned, the insides moist and seasoned with just a bit of ginger and garlic. The Pudina Paratha, a whole wheat bread with mint, was superb.\n\nIndulging in desert I had the Rabri, a milk pudding with blueberries. Wow!\n\nIt was also nice to see quite a few Indians enjoying the place too.\n\nI'm coming back.\n\nOne complaint - their web site is implemented using Adobe Flash. There's no way to copy any of the information on their web site. Bah.", "Another winner by Ashok Bajaj! I actually much preferred The Bombay Club to Rasika, both serve amazing upscale Indian food but the service at Bombay Club was far superior.\n\nThe restaurant really has a whole old world imperialism vibe...in the elegant way. I felt like I had gone back in time in some ways. Of course you must try the chat, made here with spinach and arugula. We also tried an amazing salmon dish as well as a meat curry dish.

The restaurant is more tapas style and doesn't aspire for authenticity, but you are still getting very good, high quality, inspired food that will appeal to diners not be accustomed to Korean food, while also appeasing those who are.  \n\nThe bulgogi beef sliders are my absolute favorite item on the menu and I could eat the pickles by the dozen. The wings are flavorful and they are a definite crowd pleaser, but could use a bit more crunch. I've tried their various bibimbap options and the chul-sot bulogi bibimbap, which comes sizzling hot with crispy rice soccarat is delicious. I am also a big fan of the spicy gochujang bolognese noodles with bacon, kimchi and a soft boiled egg.\n\nIn addition to the food, the ambiance and space get a solid A+ and is nicely complemented by a generally chic clientele. Danji is rather tiny, but it leans more towards \"cozy\" rather than uncomfortable and stands in vast contrast to the typical Midtown crowds full of tourists and power suits. Two thumbs up.", "MIchelin starred Korean eatery! - Simple. Striking. Attractive. Refreshing.\n\nAn amazing find! Love this place in midtown NY. Sad that they lost their Michelin star but still really good food. Went there for restaurant week this summer. They have some really interesting EtOh options that you must check out.\n\nFor the food itself, it was a 4 course meal. Got the KFC spicy wings along with spicy yellowtail sashimi. Never have i had sashimi as delicious as that with such an interesting taste that you want to keep eating more and more of it.\n\nNext we got the bossam and the galbi-gui for main course both of which were really really good, though I think the bossam might've won it for me. Soft, flavorful and delicious! The combination of side dishes it comes with makes it all the more amazing.\n\nOk, so if I'm raving so much about this place, why only 4 stars? I'm not really a fan of the tall communal tables that fill the room. Its good if you're with friends but not really if you're looking for something romantic and want to have an intimate conversation. But other than that, this place is amazing and a must go! Next up is their other branch, Hanjan!", "Solidly three star. Everything was oddly oily, including the vegetable dumplings that were unnecessarily deep fried and encased in wonton wrappers. Kimchi Missing the tang despite some fermentation going on. Vegetables for the solid bibimbap were oily, and the rice was on the well done side. Would only come back for lunch set when in area. Happy they had sorbet option instead of ice cream.", "This tucked away and quaint spot is a wonderful gift of Korean food in the neighborhood.  The cod was heavenly, the tofu was cooked to perfection, the spicy rice cake was amazing, and the wings were spicy sauced and still perfectly crisp.\n\nI would highly recommend this as your new neighborhood favorite !", "Impeccable service with a friendly and fun-loving ambience.  Love the Chef's modern take on Korean food.   His delicate, precise touch, accompanied by a sense of humor packed with savoring flavor, gives all the dishes the right twist and zing that are 'just right' to be stand outs.  Oh yes... Cocktails are terrific as well.", "Amazingly creative Korean food. Rice cakes and bacon fried rice were standouts. Brought a major foodie with me and they were equally impressed.

Jerk broth... Hehe...\n\nEvery element was fantastic. The chicken was flavorful and juicy. The pork was nice and fatty. The shoyu marinated ackee, which I had to google, is a fruit. However it was presented in such a way and with such interesting texture that I thought I was eating some kind of offal meat like kidney, fois gras or brains. It was freaking great! The egg was perfectly cooked. The scotch bonnet paste, I thought, could have used a bit more spice to it. I was expecting HOT. But if you need some spice, just add he \"rass hot sauce\" to your bowl and you'll be good to go. The broth was really flavorful and hearty as is, but the sauce really punched it up.\n\nWe also had the coconut grilled jerk corn, which was really tasty - sweet and savory/spicy at the same time.", "Ok so I came here after seeing it advertised all over FB! Let's start by saying the decor isn't really Jamaican vibe there is a lot of retro design which speaks more to 80s then authentic Jamaican culture. There is great reggae music featuring some classics and some nice artwork but I think the decor could be updated to be more oldschool in terms of more of an island vibe maybe with trees or etc.\n\nGetting on to the food. The cod fish fritters were AMAZING!! When you dip them in the curry sauce absolutely delicious!!\n\nI had the oxtail stew which was very tasty outside of some of the pieces of the oxtail were a little hard. They could of pressured cook this some more. Although it was definitely a good portion of food. Overpriced but still tasty.\n\nLastly I had the Jamaican rum punch which was a let down given that I have had this many times it wasn't as flavorful as ik my Jamaican family makes it.\n\nOverall it is a great place to try. These are minor critiques that I believe would enhance the experience.", "I came here in the early afternoon for lunch with my cousin for her bday. It was a good amount of people.

So sweet and delicious.\n\nWe ordered the jerk chicken plate for lunch and the jerk porn Bahn mi. Both were delicious. The pork was 16, and it came with jerk fries, and the chicken was 17. It came with a half chicken, rice and peas, cucumbers and a fruit compote sauce that was delicious.\n\nI will definitely return for dinner and brunch. Great flavor. Service, drinks.

Order a lot of it. The plantains are equally delicious and I love that they let me substitute out my rice for plantains on my jerk chicken platter with absolutely no hassle. The jerk chicken isn't bad. Brunch has a nice bottomless option and the rum punch wasn't too sweet. What I like about 7A as opposed to the Houston Street location (while both great) is the openness and window space. It's a wonderful spot on a nice day because they open up all the windows and you feel like you're sitting outside.

Yummy Mac & Cheese. Who doesn't like Mac & Cheese? Hot artichoke & callaloo dip was the bomb. The jerk Chicken had a hint to spiciness. The curried shrimp was delicious with the roti bread to mop up the sauce. The Jerk Ramen with firm noodles and broth was different from the usual ramen but yet very familiar. The jerk pork was so good. Tender and all the spice. It was a hearty portions also so easily shared for two people.\n\nIt definitely was the hopping spot on a Sat night.

The decor and lighting was awesome and they played great music.\n\nMy friend and I got there early and had a drink at the bar while we waited for our group. I had a mango beer that was delicious and tasted more like juice than beer. Once our group arrived, we were seated and ordered roots and culture and pineapple mojito pitchers for the table, all of which were delicious.\n\nI had the shishito peppers and the patty melt.

I had a side of mac n cheese which was good, and collard greens which was OK.  The cornbread was great though.\n\nMy wife ordered the BBQ chicken and it was average.

It took half an hour to get us our food. I don't think it takes that long to fry chicken. Maybe it's to keep up the pretense of classiness that it takes a while to prepare the food? Who knows.\n\nI must say they tried hard to make soul food look classy, and they succeeded. Never would I have pictured such a beautifully laid out plate of fried chicken.\n\nBut that's really all it was. That's all it seems the place is, appearances with no substance. The chicken was dry without much flavor, both the fried and smothered. The jerk chicken was actually soft, but didn't seem to have that characteristic jerk taste.\n\nAll in all, I'd say avoid this place if you want an actual soul food experience.

You name it, they have it.  Carts come by with great frequency and anything you don't see just ask a passing waiter.  Service staff cleans the table quick as well.\n\nProbably the best items to get are the standard shrimp dumplings, Shanghai dumplings (xiao long bao), and the absolute best was the sea bass (it literally melts in your mouth as it's so soft, and the flavor just screams deliciousness in your mouth).\n\nOverall a fantastic place, just very pricey.", "Even with COVID-19, Yank Sing is still serving up delicious Chinese dim sum. Awarded a Michelin star, this is a great place to try dim sum. A bit on the pricey side for dim sum but you will not be disappointed with the food quality! Peking duck with its crispy lacquered skin and fluffy buns, Shanghai dumplings, egg custard tart are must trys!", "We have visited this place twice on weekends so far and both times ate so much that we rolled out of the restaurant. There was only a short queue both times as the place is quite large and they also expand into the atrium area when it gets crazy crowded.\n\nFood is served via push-carts that make their rounds in the restaurant. Be prepared for the less popular carts to visit often due to the lower take-up rate. Decent: xiao long bao, har-gow, siu mai, pork spare-ribs, lotus leaf rice, rice noodle rolls with shrimp (although it is $9.45). Do note that porridge is only served on weekends.\n\nTea ($2 per person) is served in a huge glass pot. I find that I often have to ask for hot water refills in other restaurants but the one huge pot here will suffice for 2 people for one long meal.\n\nThere is validated parking for 3 hours on weekends so be sure to take up that offer instead of parking on the street (not easy making the rounds to find street parking anyway due to the heavy traffic). Knocked off a star as it is sadly on the pricier end of the scale. Paid $90 plus tip for a lunch here for two recently.", "Some people believe this is a \"honky\"-biased experience (Yank/ee Sing hehe)... well I think a bit different. I was introduced to this restaurant by some Asian imports from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong- they all suggested it's pretty authentic, taste-wise. My sweet girlfriend, who happens to be a beautiful Asian woman, also seemed to like it here. We weren't raving about it, but definitely see Yank Sing as a higher level Dim-Sum experience than most places in LA / Monterey Park / Rosemead, Walnut, etc. areas... :) Bummer, I wish there was a more upscale Dim-Sum restaurant that is a bit closer to where I live!!!\n\nWe agree it's on the expensive side, though. The places in Monterey Park and Rosemead are so much cheaper- here you must have a considerable budget to afford the otherwise super good Shanghai pork dumplings with vinegar and ginger, and all other goodies.\n\nOne thing we appreciate about this restaurant (especially this location): unlike many other Dim-Sum restaurants, this one has a bit more attractive visual presentation... While I wouldn't call it a marvel of interior design decoration, it is very clean, bright and even cosy. Very few Kantonese restaurants that I know can be designated as cosy- so this is a real achievement...", "One of best places for Dim Sum in the city. I have been there at least 9 times and I still give it 5 stars. If you sit inside, you can get first crack at the trays as they roll out of the kitchen.  The outside seating in the atrium is nice too, but your faaar from the kitchen kid.", "Gotta say it was really quite good dim sum.  I know, it's very polished and cleaned up and caters as much to Chinese people as it does to the \"gweilos,\" but the food was very good.\n\nUsually the true test dish of a dim sum place is Xiao Long Bao - the steamed Shanghainese pork dumplings.  These bite sized morsels need to be served hot, with skin that's not so thin or overcooked that it \"breaks\" if you pick it up, but not so thick that it requires extra chewing.  Ideally, you want it so that you can see the sack barely holding the juice in and the thing pops and then melts in your mouth.  Yank Sing xiao long bao met the test and passed, squirting pork juice and all.\n\nChar Siu Bao and Har Gow were also quite good, though I felt the Shumai was only so-so.  Loved the sweet tofu dessert with a hint of ginger - very refreshing and soothing.\n\nThe bill was surprisingly expensive.  I guess they gotta pay for that real estate.  So not a cheap weekend brunch option, but definitely a mouth-watering one.", "They have the best dim sum in town but of course it comes with a steep price tag. Their Shanghai dumplings/xiao long baos are the best I've had in the bay. It was as good as the ones we had at Din Tai Fung in Australia. All of their other dishes are delicious, too!

Mango Pickle is a more 'modern' take on your traditional Indian food, so the dishes are very creative and quite delicious.  Marisa (chef/owner) really knows her spices and understands flavor combinations/textures.  To those reviewers who have commented on the fact that the portions are too small, they were the perfect size for the two of us.  We shared a butter chicken (beautifully cooked -- tender and tasty), and the vegetable/lentil plate.  We also took the suggestion of our (very knowledgeable) waiter Demetrius and ordered the Bhel Puri (a cold chick pea dish) as an accompaniment.  Marisa's menu is seasonal (so everything is very fresh), but the Bhel Puri is always an option. ( It's a \"don't miss\"!)  And even though we were quite full, we ordered the mango ice cream for dessert -- which was beautifully presented on top of a bed of chocolate sauce and with a side of 'crunchy things -- reminded me of mini churros).  Not only is the food delicious, but the restaurant is decorated beautifully (even candles on the tables) and provided a welcoming atmosphere. (On a separate note, make sure you go to the rest room -- it'll put a smile on your face.)", "Everything here is fine, but decided not worth it for the price. Portions are small, extras are extra, and the quality doesn't make up the difference. Take the messed-up chai. This is one of those assemble-your-own cocktails, which I already hate (the point of paying $8-12 for a cocktail is that the professional ensures the proportions are right!). The chai itself was masterful - spicy and delightful. But the bourbon was cheap stuff and so completely overpowered the flavor of the chai. I found myself adding packet after packet of sugar just to taste something other than antiseptic. The butter chicken suffered a similar fate - the sauce was interesting and spicy (not at all what I think of for butter chicken!), the mushroom were delicious, but the chicken was overcooked and relatively flavorless! Rice/naan are not included and rice is $5 per person, pushing this comfortably into the $25-30 entree range. But the food just doesn't live up to it!", "Made the trek to mango pickle last weekend and found a cozy spot decorated with some pretty sari panels but the rest of the experience wasn't as interesting...\n\nFood was fine with a couple good twists...\n-samosas - solid standard fare\n-chickpea batter onion rings & bitter gourd - nice take on fried onion rings, didn't care for the bitter gourd\n- baingan bharta - fine, could have used more spice\n- chana masala - same as baingan bharta\n- roasted leg of lamb - definitely the best thing ordered, meat was tender and flavorful\n\nService was spotty, started good but then the waitress was hard to track down, food took way too long to hit the table ( yep the hangry kicked in) and ironically, they were quite stingy with the mango pickle (which had to be requested)...\n\nOverall, it was fine especially if you're in the neighborhood, but probably won't be doing another trek...", "I really like this restaurant. Fantastic Indian food, excellent service, and great atmosphere. However, they have recently switched to a primarily prix fixe format which really limits the choices on their a la carte menu.

We chatted with the chef (Marisa), bar tender (Maria) and Nakul. Everyone was pleasant and gave us great suggestions. Don't go to Mango pickle if you're expecting a traditional indian meal (the food won't be excessively greasy, spicy, and you won't find chicken tikka masala or the usual ingredients)...Visit for a non-traditional, experimental and fresh take on indian food!

My initial visit was in the heart of Downtown San Diego several months ago and I had to pay another visit when I saw there was a location in La Jolla.\n\nThere seems to be a constant line during the lunch time rush. The line looked like it would take longer than it did but we ended up only waiting about 15-20 minutes.\n\nIf there is anything you get out of this review... GET THE CARNE ASADA FRIES ($8.89)! One of the best I've personally tried. The extra crispy french fries are topped with gooey melted cheese, two scoops of guacamole, a dollop of sour cream, and the flame grilled asada. *chefs kiss\n\nOn top of the fries, I also ordered a Baja Taco ($2.99) and Al Pastor Burrito ($7.69). Good sized taco and burrito (it was ALL meat in that burrito)! The only downside is that I wish the tortillas on the tacos were a bit more charred / crispy but overall, such a great experience.\n\nSalsa condiments are self serve. Decent amount of outdoor seating available and a few spaces inside. Parking can be rough as there are only about 3 spaces in the lot but there is also street parking available.", "Stopped by here today for lunch with some friends. I got three tacos. The Al Pastor, Carne Asada and the Baja taco. The Al Pastor has rotisserie marinated pork with a red hue to the meat and served with cilantro, onions cilantro sauce and pineapple, The carne asada comes with grilled steak, cilantro, onions, guacamole and salsa. The Baja comes with battered fish, cabbage, cilantro, tomato, onions and a Chipotle sauce. All the tacos were very good but I liked the Al Pastor taco the best. The tacos average 3-4 dollars. They do get busy so be patient. They have some outdoor seating available. It's best to eat them right away when they're still hot as they don't taste as good when they cool off. If you have vegetarian or vegan friends just be warned they prepare the items on the same grill as the meat items.", "Changed my life. Get the California burrito for sure, and if you want tacos make sure to add cheese because they dress it up w/ a fried cheese skirt on the flat top. We also tried the churros which are made fresh on-site at the front of the store. Definitely would recommend those too.\n\nTheir tortillas are handmade too! We chose flour tortilla for the California burrito and it was almost buttery in a way? Like flaky, super soft and chewy -- and it was probably the most stand-out part of it for me. Also the fries aren't soggy!! For tacos we chose corn tortilla, which was also very good w/ the fresh grainy texture.\n\nThe nopal taco is kind of like a more meaty bell pepper if you're interested in trying it, and the steak / carnitas, sonora tacos are all good moves too.\n\nThey have a good variety of sauces too so don't be shy in asking for all of them to try!\n\nPro tip - if the line is long, order online and then just wait 15 min to pick up your order instead of waiting to get to the front :)", "Dividing my review into a couple of sections, I'd recommend reading through but feel free to skip to the section you're interested in most\n\nWait Time\nNot worth the wait. Yup, putting it right out there that if you see a 10+ person line out the door, walk away. The line moves excruciatingly slow and there's no shade at all. I'd rather be on the beach or sipping a cold beer than wait in a line in the sweltering heat for an hour\n\nFood\nBest carne asada taco in my 6 day SD trip and that alone is worth coming back for...  but nothing else.

I believe the corn tortillas are home made as well and you know you can't go wrong there! The pollo asada tacos were good too.

Both were phenomenal with meat that had been marinated in some magical flavors that were such a wonderrful combo of sweet and savory.

I could barely pick up the taco without meat scattering all over the place; usually a good indicator! At the least, the pile of meat somewhat justifies the price.\n\nSadly that's the end of my praise. These tacos are just really really basic. It's a large pile of meat in a shell.  The meat is well seasoned, well cooked and overall the tacos taste decent, but It's just nothing to go out of your way for.\nA bit more onions and cilantro, etc. Would go a long way to helping balance the flavor and texture a bit and adding some complexity.\n\nThe sauce that came on the side with the tacos was pretty bad.

Cheap ingredients combined with moderate to high prices (for Mexican food) is not a recipe for success.\n\nService was attentive. There were not too many other people here on a Friday night which we thought was odd. We should have taken that as a sign...\n\nWe order the chips and salsa which was the highlight of the meal. The habanero salsa was flavorful and packed a mean heat kick. You could definitely taste the sweetness in the salsa to balance the heat. The second hottest salsa was excellent as well.\n\nWe had the steak tacos, pork tacos, and the carnitas gordita. All the tacos are generously full and that isn't a good thing in this situation. Never order the steak from here. It smells and is just a cheap cut of meat. Super chewy and not worth it. The pork is bland and there was nothing in the taco to help it.\n\nThe gordita is huge and definitely is made to share. It is stuffed full of ingredients. The crunch of the shell gives it good texture. Again just way too big and nothing flavorful about it.\n\nWe ended up throwing away half the gordita and 3 tacos.

The restaurant is located in a small building (similar to a house) so you may miss it as you are driving on Alameda de la Pulgas.\n\nOnce you walk in, there is a small bar behind the hostess and 2 small rooms for dining. There seem to be many regular customers who know the waiters and waitresses by name.\n\nThe menu emphasizes fresh, organic, locally sourced ingredients. They also have daily specials: we tried the kabocha pumpkin soup of the day with shrimp tempura on the side (amazing) and pork 2 ways (pork loin and pork belly), which was also delicious. We ordered the cheese platter with honey (from the owner's own beehive) and it was great.\n\nThe only item that I didn't enjoy as much was our dessert, which was a chocolate hazelnut cake with coconut ice cream. It was good but nothing memorable.\n\nService is friendly but can be a little slow. Prices were about $150 for 3.", "One of my favorite restaurants. A farm to table kind of place that's a cut above the rest. If I had the money I would be eating here all the time.\n\nFood: 5/5. I'm amazed by this place every time I come here. Food is so delicious. Try the trout salad for sure! It is expensive here, but definitely worth the price considering many other restaurants charge even more. The place is not perfect however - I've ordered two different duck dishes here, and they just don't get it right here. I'm still giving the place a 5/5 though because I have been impressed by everything else I've tried.\n\nService: 5/5. Impeccable service. This is the best you can get. Waiters and staff are so attentive and courteous. I feel like royalty every time I'm here.\n\nAtmosphere: 5/5. A nice, rustic farm interior that's not too rustic. I've sat inside and outside and have had good experiences with both. The first time my girlfriend and I came here for dinner, we had the whole patio area to ourselves, and it was a perfect dinner date. A great date or special occasion spot.", "Brought my boyfriend here as part of his birthday celebration!\n\nWe started at the bar and had cocktails off of their summer menu, both of which were unbelievably good and well priced. I had a fig-themed drink, while he had a lavendar-themed one. I would definitely come back again just for drinks! Both of our drinks were unique, delicious and strong.\n\nTo start, we had a 1/2 dozen of the Pacific Oysters and fried squash blossoms. Both of these were so good--the oysters especially were super fresh and dressed in a light vinaigrette that complemented their flavor. The squash blossoms are a seasonal dish and were well done--crispy but still tender and delicate.\n\nFor entrees, we had the short ribs and roasted chicken, which were also both perfectly prepared. The short ribs in particular were incredibly tender and savory!\n\nWe had strawberry shortcake for dessert--this was good to and came beautifully plated in a deconstructed style, but I honestly would pass on this in the future in lieu of a drink from the bar.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience! Service was friendly and the complementary biscuits were as good as everyone says. We loved our appetizers and drinks and thoroughly enjoyed the rest of our meal.", "This is a restaurant of choice for us for special occasions. Tonight the food was exceptional as always, great local sustainable ingredients beautifully integrated into wonderful flavor combinations and an amazing wine list of California wines.\n\nI had the Pacific Catch of the day which was fresh line caught halibut,  prawns, mussels & squid in a tomato broth and topped with a saffron aioli. The broth was light, with some heat that was cooled by the aioli in a very flavorful combination.\n\nThe best part of the experience for me is always the friendly, knowledgeable staff. Our waitress tonight, Shannon, added enjoyment to our meal with informational tidbits about our meal ingredients, like the molasses used to finish the pork belly second course, the kaffir lime ice cream with hints of cardamom served on the black fig hand pie and the strawberry shortbread cookies made with berries from their property.\n\nIt is also a nice touch when Jesse is there and stops by to welcome you and check on how things are going.", "The prices here have become exploitative while the service has plummeted. Wine markup is worse than I have seen even at extremely prestigious, Michelin starred institutions that can charge whatever they want. A $40 vegetarian sampler plate is priced as something very special. Well, it included a piece of toast with a slice of cheese melted on top and three other completely unmemorable sides. Tapioca for dessert runs you $14. $14 tapioca!!\n\nAnd then there is the service. They automatically charge you 20% gratuity for grossly substandard service. One of the best strengths of Flea Street used to be the wonderful, professional servers. No longer. Expect to be abandoned at your table for long stretches and expect basic service concepts like offering to take a wine order before entrees come out to be out of the question.\n\nWe should all strive to be sympathetic to restaurants having legitimate struggles during these difficult times. But in this case, with the huge drop in quality of food and service on top of the crazy price hikes, I sadly won't be coming back to Flea Street.", "Flea Street is a classic case of an over-priced restaurant on the Peninsula that would never get away with this if it were in San Francisco.  If Flea Street simply dropped their prices and formal nature, the place would do so much better.  The food is excellent thanks to the owner's organic philosophy, and I generally am all about the food.  \n\nAfter two visits and rather stiff bills, however. we would much rather frequent other spots in the area.  If we want to spend money, we go the Village Pub in Woodside where at least there is atmosphere and it's alive.  Flea Street is dead and there's a reason.

The food is unique and tasty, my favorite being the popcorn with duck confit- eaten with chopsticks.

For five or six appetizers and four cocktails, we paid something like $65!!\n\nWould love to come back for a proper dinner someday.", "I really don't like to write bad reviews.  Unfortunately last nights experience at Montrio was a bad experience.  I made reservations for my husband and I and arrived shortly before.  We were seated right away and greeted by our server.  Everything went well until we received our entrees.  My husband ordered the dry aged steak and I had the salmon.  His cut of meat was terrible very fatty and definitely not worth $44.  My salmon was a small piece on a bed of rissotto that was undercooked and cold as well as flavorless.  We decided we weren't going to suffer through and sent it all back.  The manager came out and asked what was wrong after explaining everything she said ok and left. Didn't do anything to make us want to come back.  So we won't be back. There are too many restaurants in the area to bother.\n\nThere seems to be no way to respond to comments so I will update my status to say that as we brought a bottle of wine purchased from Taste of Monterey there would have been no corkage fee.", "This is one of our favorite dinner spots in the area! We called ahead, made a reservation and we're glad we did - it was pretty packed for a Sunday night.\n\nWhere to start? The food was amazing. I had the scallops and they were delicious. My husband had the bistro steak and fries (which were wonderfully garlicky) and he loved it.\n\nAlso, our server was really great. I was slightly agonizing between the angel hair pasta and the scallops and he offered to combine the two - it was perfect! I also noticed he'd wait off to the side when he would come up to our table and there was a conversation going on. His timing was great and he was super polite.\n\nIt's crazy because the ambiance is super fancy but the tables have paper table covered and crayons on the side for the kiddies to go to town. It didn't draw in any obnoxious touristy families but it still seemed like a cool place for parents to have a night out with their kids. We saw a couple families having a good time.\n\nWe'd definitely recommend this spot and you should for sure make a reservation to secure your seat!", "I was very happy with our meal here!  This place is quaint and charming and has a huge menu to choose from. There selection of small bites were so tempting we decided to order several of those with a salad rather than an entree. The lobster mac and cheese is a MUST have, it was fabulous. The oatmeal brie was equally delicious.  The calamari was good but I was expecting whole calamari but they were actually calamari steaks.  Service was perfect, attentive but not overbearing.  They also have a kids menu, I love an upscale place that accomodates (well behaved) children as well.  It was fairly reasonable having just the small bites but some of the entrees did look pretty pricey.  Good selections of wines by the glass or bottle and a creative menu of specialty cocktails.", "Recommended by the hotel we were staying at. Was advised to make reservations.  Good thing we did the place was packed for a Sunday night. Half priced bottle of wines on Sundays seem to be the big draw, rightfully so. We ordered a nice pinot noir. Elk cove 2012. Nice price good taste.  I ordered the short ribs and hubby had the sirloin with pesto. Both delicious.  Only advice the Brussels sprouts were not that great.  They will allow subs such as broccolini as the couple ordered and said was delicious.  Topped off with their famous bread pudding which was to die for. Next time we are in Monterey we will definitely come back.", "This is a long review so I will cut to the chase - The food is amazing and I have never experienced such incredible service, attention and kindness as this restaurant. My husband, son and I were in the area for a conference and found this place nearby our hotel. We walked in with our 18 month old son and were a bit apprehensive as it was very nice inside. However, when we got to our table, there were crayons and paper waiting so we felt better. Our food arrived, we were doing our best to keep our son occupied but he is at the age where this is nearly impossible. It's hard to go out to eat these days. The server, seeing this, came up, asked our son if he wanted to go for a walk, and then promptly lifted him onto her hip and continued to wait tables. We had a chance to enjoy a delicious meal.  When she returned, our son was beaming and even had a balloon that they gave him.  The food was phenomenal and the service far exceeded our expectations.", "Love Montrio Bistro. Best time to go is right when they open to avoid crowds. Had a nice quiet dinner. The calamari and oat covered brie cheese was devine. Had the burger. Very good and intense with flavor had a thick piece of the bacon on top. The staff was amazing and I love how at the end of your meal you can buy a round of beer for the kitchen!

True, the space is a bit small, and table (or should I say shelf) space makes vigorous eating a bit limited -- but oh the sheer delight of stumbling upon delectable goodies!  \n\nService is warm and friendly (although I did go on a Monday night, so they had the time to be attentive) and the drinks are good (The Basil Lemonade is quite refreshing, but another cocktail involving champagne and a sugar cube fell flat in my opinion.  The rioja is a good bet as well).  *Edit: The Miguel Mo-something or other bottle of rioja is delish!  Light, yet ends with an interesting compliation of flavors.\n\nTapas are good, but in my opinion, not as packed with flavor and well done as Tia Pol.  But being so young, I'm sure the kitchen will have time to perfect their dishes.  Meanwhile, try the pig ear salad (it's got great texture) and the eggplant in honey  (mmm honey...)", "El Quinto Pino is tucked within an otherwise unremarkable street off of 9th Avenue. Alex Raij was one of the original chef-owners here when it opened in 2007. And after some ownership issues and also after the successful opening of Txikito Raij and her husband Montero now takes turns operating and cooking at both Txikito and El Quinto Pino. In comparison El Quinto Pino approximates the authentic tapas experience far more than Txikito. There are no tables here, just a bar and a counter around the room. They take no reservations and yet it is always packed. It's exactly the kind of spot that reminds you of eating tapas in Barcelona, where you eat and drink standing, reaching over fellow patrons to receive your raciones. Despite the atmosphere being the most authentic here, the tapas itself is a slight departure from traditional tapas, albeit deliciously so. The lengua llumacenas is excellent here, the tongue braised to tenderness and contrasted with capers. And the uni panini is phenomenal. In fact, this sandwich has been called sandwich of the year by the New York Times. There isn't much to say about the service, but then again great service was never the reason for frequenting a tapas bar. The food is scrumptious, the wine list is excellent, and the prices are comparatively reasonable.", "Tapas in NYC always seems to be the first two options in Goldilocks and the Three Bears: too this, or too that, but never just right.

The spicy aioli has a nice balance of richness and spice.\n\nTorreznos - As the menu says, a bag of bacon. Can get a bit oily but again, it is bacon.\n\nCalamari a la plancha** - The reason for the double \"*\" is because this is incredible. Perfectly cooked, the black garlic and cheese; MMM! This might be one of my favorite calamaris anywhere.\n\nQueso fundido - The bread, the anchovies, the peppers, the spice.

Awesome pintxos, bocadillos, and great wine list all from Spain. Definitely get the cod and the tongue because both are underrated highlights of the menu.

It's a bright room that is fairly inviting.  The star of the show is the food though and it's something that is present once you walk into the restaurant.  \n\nThe chicken pot pie is the house special, but I recommend you ask about the specials each day as it can be quite good.  I had the picahna special with collard greens and potatoes.  The meat was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.

She makes everything by hand, including the table linens!\n\nIf you like Brazilian food, this is the only place to go to for authentic home cooked food. Coxinha, kibe, fish grill, yucca fries, pot pie, picanha steak, feijoada (only on Saturday) are all favorites and musts.\n\nAlso oftentimes when I hear authentic and home cooked in reviews I get scared the food quality isn't great. In this country, food quality varies in a frightening degree, from hormone pumped, GMO'd food to real, organic food. And sometimes there's no telling what ingredients restaurants use, and then you leave feeling sick and sad. Natalia sources all her food locally and sustainably. She doesn't advertise it as such, but it's a huge plus and a large reason why we have eaten there consistently for 7 years now.", "Wood Spoon is one of those places that wins you over with small details: the view of the kitchen from the small dining room through a frame cut through a book chest, the free filtered water infused with various goodies (cinnamon sticks, orange peel, etc), the eclectic flea market vintage chairs, etc. The food is pretty good too. It's simple but good and satisfying. As a vegetarian, I was limited to their grilled veggi bowl, but everything tasted good on my plate, from black beans to plantains. My boyfriend had a chicken and he said that he loved the accompaniments (the same things I had in my bowl) better than the bacon-wrapped chicken. All in all, I loved the atmosphere, the unobtrusive service, and the flavorful food. They should open up another location in my area (Hollywood).", "All i can say is this is a gem of a restaurant. Its so cozy and inviting. The staff is so sweet and when your there you feel like your at home with family having dinner.\n\nMy favorite off the menu was the Brazilian Chicken Pot Pie,which had hearts of palm, olives, and roasted corn. It was very flavorful and the pastry was light /flaky. The salad that accompanies it is also very refreshing since it is blanched in a very light dressing. The best part about this was the aioli that is served on the side, the creamy texture has a spicy kick that works well with the flavors in the pot pie.\n\nDrink of choice is the White Chardonnay Sangria, with passion fruit and orange. Lets just say next time im ordering a pitcher of this because it is so good and refreshing.\n\nSo the next time you want a home cooked meal and a home vibe, i suggest you stop in and have a bit to eat here.

A relatively easy hour and a quarter drive from San Francisco brings you to the Inn.  The restaurant has a somewhat rustic feel.  A bright, cheery mural of farm scenes circles the ceiling of one room.  Tables are well spaced and service is attentive.  \n\nI start with a signature appetizer of lobster and fennel sausage.  Three perfectly seared discs of lobster and fennel are served above a cool potato salad. A visual delight.  However, the taste of the lobster is overpowered by the fennel and char from the cooking pan.  The mini cubes of potato, each perfectly formed, are tasty and testimony to meticulous preparation.  I wished that the plate could have been deconstructed with the lobster served on the side.  \n\nRabbit, rabbit, rabbit is, you guessed it, rabbit served three ways.  The roasted rack was succulent and absolutely perfect.  Likewise the bacon wrapped loin.  The confit of leg was the slightest bit dry, perhaps due to how lean rabbit is, but substantially rescued by a wonderful whole grain mustard sauce.\n\nA dessert of lemon semifreddo sided by peaches and a streusel cookie was very nicely done but unremarkable.", "For a restaurant with obvious ambition it fell woefully short.

Interruptions while conversing with each other and being reached across to clear glasses were just some of the annoying and quite frankly rude displays from our waiter. Lucky for him they automatically add 20% as he was not worth it. The food was hit and miss. The signature rabbit 3 ways was ok but not memorable and a little bland with the exception of the bacon wrapped loin which was dry and only tasted of bacon.

It was a well timed production of people taking care of us and we enjoyed our evening.", "Best 3-course dinner I've had in a very long time.\n\nWe decided to skip dessert and just went for 3 savory courses.\n\nHamachi crudo two ways was delicious. I like the sliced crudo more than the tartare preparation, but both were light, citrusy and flavorful. The finger lime rinds and tobiko offered interesting texture as well.\n\nThe scallop with pork belly was probably the best plate of the evening. The scallop was tender and well seasoned, and with the juicy and fattiness of the pork belly, it made for a very savory and rich dish. But the dish also came with this wonderful carrot mousse, which lightened things up and lent a balancing sweet flavor to the dish.\n\nI got the guinea hen for my entree course. It was a really big portion. I particularly enjoyed the natural jus. The hen was cooked tender, but was a little tough, so I really needed the jus to keep things juicy.", "Combo of 2 visits: first was 5 star all the way, but second was more a 4.5. Still, service is always exquisite, so I'll bump it up to the #5 level.\n\nPrix fixe varies daily but you can do a 3 course or 4 course. The foie was beautifully prepared but the use of too much crunchy salt crystals was a mistake. They don't melt in quick cooking and the crunch was unpleasant. And pickled fruit is overdone these days.\n\nSalads were beautiful and just right. But halibut was a bit overcooked so herb pesto was welcome. The pork chop was unevenly cooked, a huge mistake at this price level. Also, it was underseasoned; we like low-salt and appreciate subtlety, but this chop needed a boost. But the magnificent fresh vegetables from the restaurant's farm saved the dish; they were amazing.\n\nDesserts are always excellent here. I had the decaf French press and even Spouse loved it; very high quality and a smooth-tasting blend - maybe medium roast?

I thoroughly enjoyed this drink (enough to order another!).\n\nThe beautiful aspect of Juno is that the chefs offer a wide variety of fish that you cannot get at most sushi restaurants. Rarely, do you see an offering of lean tuna, medium fatty tuna, AND fatty tuna for nigiri or sashimi. We ordered a variety of items from the nigiri and sashimi menu, and the fish was so fresh. As well, we tried the ceviche maki and spicy tuna maki. Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious.\n\nYes, this restaurant is pricy, but it is worth it for the high quality sushi you are getting.", "Juno is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I can't believe I just realized I've never wrote them a review. All nigiri is Great - love the sake and Akami usually most. I like to do 2-4 sake that's my favorite. Sometimes order the salmkn trio. Then you have to get the Juno King and Juno Queen - they're the best - bite sized and each come with 2 bites so if you're with more than 2 people order multiple of those. Also get the \"signature smoked\" hamachi and sake- need to get both as they're both very different and amazing. Again bite sized for 2 people. Comes out smoking on the wood. SO GOOD. The best sushi roll is called taco something - I don't usually get it but if I get one, it's the best. Atmosphere is very homey, comfortable, intimate, quieter and everyone is so friendly. Second to none best quality nigiri you'll get in Chicago by far.", "My boyfriend took me to a new spot for date night. Juno is beautiful. It is deceptively bigger than what it looks like. We chose a lot of dishes because the servings are small. I really like how fresh the fish was. Also, there wasn't a lot of sauce covering the fish each dish was simple and highlighted the main attraction, the raw fish. I really like this place and would come back here for another date night."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/juno-chicago-2?hrid=jN2jRqQ8rvgjbp5Fr-IXVw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/juno-chicago-2?hrid=h1jaTKpdn756ZQu-WFDL1g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/juno-chicago-2?hrid=VwMilAPG3DMEOLmhtG-kKQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/juno-chicago-2?hrid=uyBuSvR2LGWJEZr8GWBcFw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/juno-chicago-2?hrid=Y8e99ATtksOeFkoFqUyw_g&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/juno-chicago-2?hrid=rS3YnNg2raULRhJLbXGIFg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/juno-chicago-2?hrid=Jwu-S7Y4Wbl3wMYwLkWwCA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Cesarina", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/cesarina-san-diego-3/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-san-diego/restaurant/cesarina", "michelin_pov": "Step into this charming trattoria and you\u2019ll instantly feel like part of the famiglia.

You truly feel an elegance while simultaneously vibing with comfort.\nNow, let's get started with the food, by far the best Italian food I've ever had, and I have had my fair share of Italian. But once you hit Cesarina's there's no going back. Say goodbye to Olive Garden and Buca Di Pepos after Cesarina's the standard will always be escalated. Each pasta is made with local ingredients and from scratch with love. With every taste you know the ingredients are wholesome. Their Funghi pasta is by far my favorite. Their blend of earthy mushrooms with a cream sauce is to die for. The pesto is by far the most wonderful ever, sticking to the classic recipe while maintaining local ingredients really enhances the flavors of the pasta. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED WITH THE TIRAMISU!!! Once again, made from scratch and created right in front of you. The tiramisu is an entertaining mind boggling sensation that will tingle your taste buds. Like I said. Once you go to Cesarina's, there's no going back", "My new favorite Italian spot in SD! We live pretty close and decided to check it out after seeing how busy it was every night. And let me tell you, this place did not disappoint!\n\nI would definitely recommend a reservation, unless you arrive right when they open, because it does get pretty packed. The service is phenomenal and they are very knowledgable/friendly. We asked a lot of questions and our waiter did a great job with recommendations.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of red wine for the table and everyone tried a different pasta dish. Every time I go to an authentic Italian restaurant, I have to try the gnocchi (it's my favorite pasta dish). The best gnocchi I've ever had was at a 5 star restaurant in Chicago and I haven't tasted gnocchi that good... until now! I ordered the gnocchi pesto and it was delicious. It tasted homemade and the ingredients were fresh. Not only was my dish an 11/10, but everyone else raved about how great theirs was as well.\n\nI'm excited to go back and try more items on the menu. You can mix and match your pasta so it was a bit overwhelming when I first looked at the menu. But I don't think you can go wrong with any dish, it all looks good!", "I really enjoyed to eat here. The inside of location is pretty cute with the Panificio corner (it reminded me home memories). Everything on the menu is very catchy. I loved the thing that you can choose the type of pasta and your favorite sauce. But I also loved dishes already combined. Therefore I chose \"gnocchi al tegame\" (no pork) while my husband \"mafalde agnello e carciofi\". We also shared a starter \"polpo, buttata e zucca\" and drank two glasses of Valpolicella. Everything was delicious from the starter to the main dish. The only note is that the polpo was a little burnt that I couldn't eat a little piece of it.\nThe portion of the pasta is huge. Even though I was completely full, I love when the portion is big, as the Italian style. We were so full that we didn't try the dessert (our bad).\nThe only dowside is the position of the restaurant because it's far from downtown, but it worths every type of fatigue.", "Absolutely DELICIOUS! Not only is the restaurant itself beautiful, but this boutique Italian restaurant is where you'll find all the locals. It is a San Diego gem off the beaten path! The service is exceptional - everyone is friendly and attentive. Every bite from the in-house brioche to the in-house made pasta was exactly how you dream of Italian cuisine to taste. My husband and I tried the special of the day ravioli and the steak. Their steak melted in my mouth - cooked to perfection. Every bite was more delicious than the last as all the flavors began to build on each other. You must try the zucchini blossom appetizer and for dessert and you have to do the tiramisu! They assemble it at your table! Such a fun and unique experience. Cesarina is absolutely authentic and cared for by a crew of owners who love what they do and are passionate about the food of their homeland. You are instantly whisked away to another place as soon as you step foot in their BEAUTIFUL patio. I cannot suggest this place enough, but make a reservation! The line out the door tells it all!", "Honestly had an incredible experience here. The ambiance transports you to Italy with the colorfully mismatched hand-painted plates, the wall of preserves and the cozy tables capes. Pasta being made the entire evening behind the glass wall and everyone that works there is friendly and welcoming. The entire staff is well versed on allergies, and they have substantial vegan menu that is to die for. THERE ARE EVEN VEGAN DESSERTS! I had the vegan fungi and the vegan tiramisu and was completely blown away. I am so excited to have something of this caliber so close to home!", "great birthday spot! priceyish but so worth it. they'll make you a tableside tiramisu (or give you cake) and take polaroids of you.

But my friend and I were in the neighborhood looking for a brunch spot at 2:30pm on a Saturday and they were open.  We walked into a traditionally decorated Mexican restaurant playing the Tejano music of my childhood in Texas.  This gave it a thumbs up from the beginning.  We were immediately seated and brought chips and three types of home made salsas.  Loving this place even more.  I ordered a horchata, which was so good and the scrambled eggs mixed with Cheese smothered in spicy salsa. It came with a side of rice and beans.  Be sure to ask for a side of tortillas.  My friend ordered the beef tips appetizer as a main and shared a side of well made guacamole.  My friend loved the beef tips.  She had enough to take some home.  This place is the closest to restaurants that I grew up eating at in Texas and would highly recommend it.  We saw a lot of the neighborhood locals coming in being greeted by the servers and the owner.  The hospitality in the restaurant is amazing. NOTE: This is cash only restaurant. ( there is an ATM at the door). It is also a BYOB. So bring your libations.", "Amazing steaks. The pieces are perfectly cooked, tender, juicy and full of flavor. The corn and flour tortillas come warmed and so freshly soft. The flour tortilla is slightly toasted with a subtle glutinous chew and perfect. Chips are more fried than some restaurant style chips, but not drenched in oil. Guac and salsa red and green are good- can't go wrong here. Best bean soup I've had as well. It's BYOB and cash only. Long waits with standing room only, but worth it. This is the type of tacos you dream of repeatedly.", "My husband and I just went with another couple this past weekend. When we pulled up, we saw how packed it was and asked for the wait time. 45 minutes. OMG! I went in to put our name on the list and I could barely find where to do it! It was so many people there that they were waiting on the stairs. After about 25 minutes, a party of 30 left and freed up lots of space. We were finally seated and boy was it worth the wait! It's BYOB which is great, but they don't allow hard liquor- only wine and beer. The guacamole was good and made fresh and the cheese with chorizo was great. We ordered a half kilo of steak and half kilo of chicken and some shrimp skewers. That was the most flavorful and tender meat I have ever had. OMG! I didn't need to put any guac or salsa on it. The mariachi band was fun. They are lively and the whole restaurants sings with them (if you know the words). The staff was great. We loved our waiter Vicente. He was accommodating and always made sure we were okay. We will definitely be back here whether there's a long wait or not.", "You know they must be doing something right, if you show up on a Sunday night to a FULL house! It's cozy with lofted wooden ceilings and chandeliers that make the ambience appealing. Despite how hectic the crowds were for dinner, the service was attentive and prompt.\n\nIf a place is known for their steak, it is my personal opinion that you should probably order THE STEAK. We did just that:\n- Sabinas Tacos comes with 3 tacos stuffed FULL of ribeye steak. It's $10 and you'll be stuffed.\n- Steak Fajitas (were better in my opinion) came with perfectly seasoned & cooked skirt steak, peppers, onions & guacamole. You can create your own perfect taco with the provided tortillas.\n\nWhen I come back, I'll be looking to come with more people so we can split a kilo of skirt steak (arrachera), guacamole & tortillas.. that would be perfect meal... mmmm mmmm\n\nWhile BYOB, there is a $10 corkage fee, so we stuck with our waters and enjoyed the food!", "I first heard of this place during Mole de Mayo when their $2 steak tacos had huge hunks of delicious steak inside. The wait was pretty long for a Wednesday night, but it was just me and a friend so we got seated within 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the queso fundido, which is essentially a pan of melted cheeses and it's soooo good paired with the included chips/salsas/flour tortilla.\nWe also got the 1/2 kilo arrechera and it was definitely more than enough for 2 people. Straight up steak chunks and veggies grilled to perfection.\n\nThe ambiance is adorable; love the light fixtures and the little signs along the brick walls. The live music was amazing too - my friend actually went up to the guy to see if he could play for her wedding!\n\nThis isn't your typical cheap taco place; their menu options aren't what you would have seen at Nuevo Leon.

Pizzas are far above average, beginning with that unmistakable cornicione\u2014perfect spots of char that rim the crust and bring the flavor.

The attention to subtleties in flavors are what are most incredible here. Each little bite creates a tiny symphony of your tastebuds singing out loud for more.\n\nMeatballs al forno to start are a good move as they introduce you to the stellar dough work on display here. And the cauliflower fritti with a spicy mint aoili is almost sinfully indulgent--you have to remind yourself you're eating a vegetable after every bite.\n\nThe goat cheese/leeks/scallions/garlic/bacon pizza is stupidly fun to eat. Each part of the dish hits at separate times, exciting you more than is probably normal. The stars of this pizza are the roasted whole pieces of garlic, essentially a funky garlicky butter by the time you take a bite. The salame and Fresno chiles pizza is equally dynamic with a tangy and aromatic taste to it.\n\nNow, I'm not much of a dessert man, but if I were on death row, I'd request Pizzeria Mozza's butterscotch budino as my final meal. It's that's good, folks.\n\nAnd a cool aside: I saw Nancy Silverton walking around the restaurant which made tonight that much more of a five-star experience. She's a living legend!\n\nEat at Pizzeria Mozza! Do it now!", "Hands down--one of our favorite restaurants in LA!  The pizzas are absolutely incredible.  Each and every one that we've had the pleasure of eating--from the sausage fennel to the squash blossoms, tomato and burrata-- is phenomenal.  The crust is perfection and the toppings are divine! Aside from the pizzas, their other creations are also just as amazing.  The tricolore salad with anchovy dressing, the fried squash blossoms with ricotta, and the meatballs al forno are just sublime!  \n\nTheir reservations system is a pain, however!  You can only book 1 month ahead--no sooner or later!  But alas, the food is just so unbelievably good that you have to abide by their rules; that is, if you want a table.  Or do what we do, and just sit at the bar.  It's a lot more fun that way anyways, seeing all the pizzas being made before you and wondering which one is yours.  \n\nCan hardly wait to go again--and again--and again!!!", "This review is only for the caramel coppetta.  The entire meal was worthy of fivr stars, but I want to highlight this dessert.\n\nTheir pastry chef, Dahlia Narvaez, won the James Beard award year, and she definitely knows what she's doing.\n\nThe caramel coppetta had a burnt caramel gelato that was more savory than sweet.   At first I thought it was peanut butter. The actual caramel on the plate (and there wasn't much of it, but it was the perfect amount) not overly sweet either.   The marshmalow \"sauce\" was ice cream-like in its texture and the sweetness was subdued.  All of this was served on top of a pizzelle cookie that had some occasional strong anise seed bites.  The Spanish peanuts were the perfect compliment.\n\nI'm not a dessert person, but sheesh, this totally wrinkled my brain!", "Mozza is the best, man.  Over and over I go back, and I just love it every time.  I've gone deep into the menu.  I love the funghi misti pizza, which marries a myriad of mushrooms with a nice fontina and taleggio.  The margherita is simple, with bright, tangy tomato and creamy mozz.  I am not as huge on the egg, guanciale pizza but you may dig it.  There's a great richness to it but I like a little sauce on my pie.  The pizzas generally consist of an amazing, crispy crust that has clearly felt the blazing sting of the the wood fired oven.  I need to install one of those.\n\nI've also tried the sandwiches.  They are fantastic if you aren't in the mood for pizza.\n\nYou have to save room for dessert here.  The butterscotch budino is heaven in a glass.  It's butterscotch pudding with caramel and a little salt on top that brings the whole thing home.  The gelatos and sorbets are also fantastic.  Experiment with combinations.  They are nice sized portions for sharing...not that I share.", "The line for this spot is always crazy, so that should tell you something.  But of course it is- its famed Chef Mario Battali's baby pizza spot.   The pizza gods were on my side on this particular stormy Friday night, as it was raining and I think that drove down the crowd a bit.  I was able to actually go inside!\n\nWe put our name in and waited about 40 minutes before we got two seats at the bar where we had drinks and dinner.  The restaurant its self feels very intimate.  The lighting is very dim to my recollection, the furnishings are dark and there is very much a candle light feel to this spot despite the yellow and orange walls.  I don't remember the name of the our pizza's but I do recall that it was divine!!  We enjoyed a lovely wine with the gourmet pizza and it was all good...  \n\nPizzeria Mozza takes reservations.  I called twice and they were booked for the month on both occasions, but I strongly suggest you try making one if you want to experience what all the fuss is about.  \n\nExcellent place for a date or dinner with loved ones.  Its a small place so I suggest keeping your entourage to a minimum here.  Buon Appetito!\nxo", "Saw Nancy Silverton on Chef's table and had to go try out at least one of her restaurants. We got the brussels sprouts, guanciale, red onion & mozarella pizza and the egg, bacon, potato pizza. Honestly liked the brussels sprouts pizza a lot more than the egg and bacon pizza. The egg and bacon pizza was just a little too heavy but the brussels sprouts pizza was uniquely delicious! For dessert we had the meyer lemon gelato pie and butterscotch budino which both did not disappoint. Her bread was obviously absolutely amazing- so soft on the inside, but crispy on the outside... can probably eat just the bread and it would still be such a good meal!

Devils food cake with chocolate mouse filling and covered in ganache.\n\nCheers to Mulvaney's, truly a magnificent dining experience!", "after celebrating my bday here last night, I can easily say that mulvaneys is my favorite restaurant in Sacramento. we arrived at 610 for our 615 reservation on a Thursday night and were seated right away. dim lights, white table cloths, and light chatter over the room made for an warm, intimate mood. we ordered the smoked salmon to start as well as a glass of Pinot for me and Rh\u00f4ne blend for him. the starter was filling and tasted excellent. wasn't named one of the most iconic dishes in sac for nothing. I ordered the bacon wrapped tombo (tuna) with green beans and mashed potatoes and he had the double cut pork chops with salad and potatoes. everything from the food to the service was perfect, simple as that. I especially love that their menu is constantly changing based on what's in season, so you'll always have a chance to try something new and fresh. can't wait to go back!", "What can I say that has not already been written on this place.  Exceptional, is all I can say.  \n\nMy story........\n\nLast night we were walking home and saw the fire pit ablaze in their courtyard.  We stopped in and ordered some wine and just wanted to \"hang around the fire\" for a little bit.  About 10 minutes in, the bartender comes out and offers me a cigar.  No charge, BTW.  We order another glass of wine, still enjoying the fire that the staff continues to come out and put fresh logs on, keeping the atmosphere going.  \n\nFast forward an hour or so and Patrick Mulvaney comes out just to sit and chat for a while.  We talk about the Kings and life in downtown Sac, meet his lovely wife and just have a genuinely exceptional experience in this place.  We order the Beef Carppacio and it is as good as the atmosphere they create.  \n\nLastly, when I went to close out the bill, the bartender, while I was signing my receipt offers up a shot of whiskey for me and my companion.  Again, this was just a value add \"thank you for coming\" gesture.  \n\nBottom line is, we WILL be back, time and time again.  Not enough words to describe how great this place is.", "Do you sometimes wish you could have all the fun, culture, dining and nightlife of San Francisco but without the parking issues and high rent?  \n\nWell, wish 1/4 granted at Mulvaney's!  Patrick does a great job of creating season spectaculars on your plate in a user-friendly manner.  Instead of scaring the crap out of you with fancy words (ok, there were some words I had to say \"eh?\" to, but turns out they were just homemade pastas!) for vegetables you're pretty sure were created in a chem lab, Mulvaney's has a tangible assortment of fun things to try and experiment with and the waitstaff is friendly and approachable so you don't have to feel shy about asking what that thing with the tiny spoon is on the side of your table.\n\nSmall, intimate, romantic, playful - Mulvaney's brings come culinary quirkiness to ignite that spark in foodies' hearts.  \n\nDon't go expecting Ma's Meatloaf (or some trendy variation thereof).  Patrick does inventive and sophisticated twists using fresh, seasonal produce that your body, and palate, will appreciate."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/mulvaneys-b-and-l-sacramento?hrid=pGLCYVw36b3Jthy3nTnnIA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mulvaneys-b-and-l-sacramento?hrid=s4jdXXbztHPXYu1I0_d_TA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mulvaneys-b-and-l-sacramento?hrid=zuqpSzMKtI4p8yxM7Afg_w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mulvaneys-b-and-l-sacramento?hrid=W8DGgfDZigk2DWOhm4ECqg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mulvaneys-b-and-l-sacramento?hrid=yxT6SQ73U0Fe8x49iNCAZA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/mulvaneys-b-and-l-sacramento?hrid=_OYilBuDG_ag5zN9qdfCGw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Grange", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/grange-restaurant-sacramento/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-sacramento/restaurant/grange", "michelin_pov": "The Citizen Hotel is primo for those with business on their minds, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all just corporate here downtown.

Ambiance\nWith its high ceilings, unique multi-floor layout and handsome bar, its the perfect combination of modern elegance and old school class.\n\n2. Food\nEverything off the menu is made by top-notch chefs. I ordered a steak medium rare and that's exactly how it came out. The appetizers are all tasty. Had a pulled pork sandwich for lunch that was a juicy, tender mix of sweet and salty.\n\n3. Drinks\nThis is their biggest selling point. The first time I went was during cocktail week and believe me, these bartenders know how to make a drink that would make Don Draper smile. I love how this is one of the few spots with Ruhstaller (my favorite local beer) on tap.\n\nFor all of the above and more, find your home at the Grange!", "Grange exudes warmth and class. It's one of my favorite restaurants downtown for a glass of wine and farm-to-fork dining. The menu is simple,  seasonal, and has something for everyone. The perfect restaurant for date night,  GNO (girls OR guys night out),  post-work drink, 'meet the parent's' dinner,  ect :) it's located within the beautiful and historic Citizen Hotel.\n\nHighly recommend: My favorite to this day is the Ribeye: Always cooked perfectly per your preference and melts in your mouth. If you're a carnivore like myself, treat yourself! Finish off with the lemon olive oil cake: Perfect parts creamy, sweet, with a citrus tartness (SWOON). For you Brunchers - the avo toast is fab!  However,  if you're looking for bottomless mimosas, Grange does not offer 'em.\n\nRight now,  you can experience a 3-course dinner at Grange for $35 (Dine Downtown). Check availability on Open Table!

I walked in to a barely seated restaurant during breakfast service and he was way too busy on the phone. He made eye contact with me but kept talking, and even switching from the phone at the bar to the phone at the host desk. I'm literally just standing there watching him for almost 10 minutes. Some sweet busser finally had to come over and offer to seat me! And my waiter even apologized that I had to wait forever to get seated. How can an entire restaurant know that someone is waiting WAY too long to get seated and the clueless, idiot host doesn't?!? This boggles my mind. I don't make it to Sacramento very often, but if this is Grange's idea of fine service I'll stick to San Francisco thank you very much.

Engaging staff.\n\nWhen time for dinner arrived our server, Clark, was welcoming and pleasant.  Our Pinot Noir from Oregon was very good.  Clark brought us a fly of olive oil.  Impressive and delicious.  Dinner was outstanding from beginning to end, as expected.\n\nMy review is more to emphasize perfect hospitality.  The ambiance of the hotel is impeccable.  The staff is remarkably well trained and knowledgeable.  Refreshing to find such service in Sac Town.  \n\nTo top this amazing experience our server Clark Andress sent us a thank you note.  Nice touch Clark.  Looking forward to dining at Grange soon.", "We headed to Grange with no expectations, other than a nice establishment for dinner that would be \"comparable\" to Ella, since we were hosting parents from the east. From their specialty cocktails, through the appetizers, main courses and dessert, we were nothing but satisfied. The flavors throughout most of the dishes were unique and exciting, and while some dishes were small, the entire meal left no empty room in our stomachs.\n\nUnlike the SacBee review, we didn't experience any severe lack of service, just a couple of kinks but nothing to be detract from making a return trip. In fact, our server was incredibly entertaining and helpful in making menu selections.\n\nPrices were not outrageous of any sort for this type of restaurant and the food we received, but it's most definitely spendy for the Sacramento area.", "One of my favorites in Sacramento. Consistent with its' stellar service, gastronomical delights, great drinks. Locates inside the Citizen. It's such a classy hotel. I don't dig the neighborhood but it's downtown, it's there and much better than most.\n\nAs far as the food, I'm a huge supporter of local and organic and the Grange delivers. The few times I've been here I also enjoyed the people watching as it's a great place for the upwardly mobile.\n\nLast time I was here I had the flatbread and a beet salad. Both outstanding. The sea bass is superb. Everything just tasted fresh and healthy and earthy. Plates of goodness that leave you feeling so good. The bartender makes a mean martini and the dessert is out of this world (butterscotch pudding). The service is attentive but unobtrusive. The decor is also lovely with high ceilings and minimal embellishments. Great place for a date. Going for brunch this weekend and cannot wait!", "Unfortunately, our most recent visit to the Grange did not compare to those we had in the past.

And for dessert we got the coconut flan with vanilla ice cream. Everything was good, but I would almost prefer the food at most taco trucks for their traditional flavors, grease, and cheap prices. I think Maya is going for innovative or upscale Mexican food with interesting ingredients, but could improve a lot with its basics like how they prepare meat and salsas. Having said that, I did really enjoy the zucchini flower quesadillas (we were served empanada-like bites topped with mole, salsa verde, and a creamy chile sauce) and the coconut flan (good flavor and texture).", "I went to Maya for a friend's bottomless brunch birthday. I hadn't heard such great things about this place and I'm honestly not sure why. We were provided with excellent service, very attentive and helpful staff, and everything came out rather quickly. The dishes come out in a family style manner and you can continuously order throughout the brunch. Most brunches are one entree and bottomless drinks, it was interesting and awesome to see that this place had both! The mimosas were very strong and there were several types offered (traditional, mango, Maya, and lychee.) The Maya Dog was great and pretty much everything dreams are made of, it was bacon wrapped, as all foods on earth should be, and had lots of stuff on top. I had an intimate experience with the pan dulce, one of the most delicious brunch items in NYC. It can be described as French toast with Nutella, whipped cream, and a variety of other toppings. The corn on the cob was excellent. The squash blossom quesadilla and chicken tinga tacos were fantastic as well. I highly recommend this for place for brunch, I loved everything that I had!", "Came here for restaurant week. The food was good but I wasn't blown away.\nWe started off with a pitcher of sangria. The amount in the pitcher was quite generous, 3 of us girls got slightly drunk off it. I think it filled about 6 glasses.\nAs for the food:\nAppetizer: mahi mahi ceviche which came with tortilla chips. It was pretty good although I was secretly hoping my fish would be a little more raw. But I know that ceviche is not the same as sashimi.\nMain course: salmon a la veracruzana. Simply put, salmon with plantain puree. The salmon was perfectly cooked, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. My friends had the huitlacocche & wild mushrooms enchilada. Huitlacocche is a kind of fungus and they enjoyed it.\nDesert: Chocoflan. Pretty good, tasted like a cupcake to me. Portion was small though.\nI saw the bar next door and it looked pretty popular.

I can appreciate that Maya tries to do Mexican in a new sort of way, but for an example of a palce that does that much better, go look up rocking horse in Chelsea. The food at Maya falls short, and is SUPER expensive (e.g. UES ripoff!!) One tamal for like 12 bucks?? WTF. Not cool. The tamal was literally drowning in this too-sweet sauce that did not mesh well with its filling.\n\nOn the other hand (there's always a silver lining), the drinks were tasty.

I had a margarita made with Tamarind, a type of corn flatbread with skirt steak and tacos with smoked brisket. The waitress was really nice and knowledgeable about the food...

Nice atmosphere and loungey bar area. Glad they turned music down when asked.", "LOVE love love the spicy margarita here! This place is always packed on the weekends and has a fun loud young vibe.

There are some different flavored ones too - I tried a spicy broiled jalapeno one that was excellent. Good selection of beers and wine from the bar too.  The only thing to be aware of is that the food and the oysters aren't cheap - they are about $3 apiece. So a half dozen will set you back $18 and with drinks you're out about $30 total more.  As for the oysters,  they are very very good.  If you don't mind the steep price, then by all means you should stop here as this is a nice restaurant to take out of town guests. I'm not sure why a few others have had some bad experiences with service??  our waiter was very prompt and helpful.  Would recommend going there again.", "On a recent Monday visit this small, upscale, attractive place was packed with hikers, locals, and tourists casually dressed. Very pleasing decor includes an outdoor space where I saw a dog waiting. The food was amazing; service equally so. The price fixed dinner, $40, included choice of leek soup or local Greek salad; semolina crusted Bolinas rock fish or seared northern steelhead, and pineapple upside down cake (not your grandmother's version) for dessert. The soup was delicious, combining pleasing flavors in a pork broth. Ditto both main dishes. Alcoholic drinks are expensive. Lemon water is served in a carafe and refilled regularly. The oysters are quite tasty. You can get a \"Raw Deal\" for $40, which includes 12 oysters and a glass of wine. Bread is extra. The French press coffee at $3 is an unexpected bargain. Verdict: excellent restaurant but pricey. After all, you are in West Marin and the options are very limited. The noise level on Yelp was listed as moderate, but I found it to be quite loud, probably intentionally. If you don't like fish, don't eat here. It was a special occasion, so the splurge was worth it.", "Driving 2 hours in traffic  from the East Bay for our raw oyster fix seems extreme but it has always been worth it for us . We have frequented Saltwater at least 3 times now and have also taken a few out of town guests here as a much enjoyed treat. I love how the menu is ever changing , based on seasonal ingredients .  Yes, it's a small selection but the quality is outstanding . On this visit the husband and I ordered the dozen raw oyster deal with a glass of wine and split the grilled cheese (with ham and fig jam on brioche).  The oyster brine is so refreshing and pairs well with the wine or a glass of their Amber Ale.  I don't usually drink beer but find myself craving the Amber Ale on tap!

We arrived at 8pm on a Friday night without reservations and were able to choose between table for 2 and the bar. Service was pretty good! We started with 2 of each of the 3 oyster varieties, and settled on our favorite one - from nearby. We tried the broiled oysters - Jalape\u00f1o was yum! Garlic covered the oyster flavor. The artisanal bread was amazing. We stuck with bread and oysters and local beer (the Amber ale tasted like honey!) and were full and happy.

I do have to say one thing though - their oysters were super FRESH. It has this salty, briny-ness to it that I've never had before. Obviously, we ended up ordering another dozen. There were two baked kinds too - I just remember enjoy the mushroom one vs the other. Porkchop pizza was ok - nice that it was freshly made from scratch.

The arcburger one of the best and biggest burgers I've ever had. Worth the $25. The meat was so flavorful and soft. Cheddar cheese and lettuce with tomato and some aoili. Sounds so simple but was so good. I would go back just for that. Didn't try it it the chicken looked amazing too. Our friends have said that the whole snapper was also excellent.\n\nThe cornbread was also quite good.\nService was excellent. The cornbread took almost 30 minutes so they comped it.\n\nWill definitely be back.", "I'm reviewing this as a lounge kind of drink place, never actually eaten here, so I can't say too much for the food. But the drinks! Oh man! They make my favorite drink here: the Italian snow cone! Sooo yummy! Not at all sweet, just the right amount of citrus and fresh herbs for fragrant! Soo refreshing and it packs quite a punch! (At $12 a drink, it better!) I've also tried the number one, gloom, and grappa sour.  Number one is similar to the Italian snowcone, in that it has that same kind of fresh citrusy feel.  Gloom tastes kinda like bitter cough syrup, minus the syrup (not my fav!). And grappa sour is a nice balance between ur sweet/citrus drinks and stronger martinis.  It also has egg whites in it, so that's a plus! Ambience is great, decor is on par with the rest of SoCo, and crowd is generally your mix of hipsters and mature money makers", "I have been to ARC a few times and came last night for my friend's birthday with both our mothers and it was amazing.\n\nOur service was excellent even though you could tell our server was covering a lot of tables in different sections, but he had a (genuine) smile on the whole evening and was so attentive.

Carrot cake\n\nEverything was great and the timing of all the dishes was at a good pace. The carrot cake was probably the best I've ever had and I'm not the biggest fan of carrot cake because it is usually subpar or too much cream/frosting. This one was moist, had home made cream (vanilla? cinnamon? I dunno) with a hint of flavor. It was about 6 layers high (6-7\") and we enjoyed every bite!\n\nHighly recommend this place, but reservations are a must.

All wood-fired cooking, amazing ingredients, super creative menu and drink list. We shared a side of Arc's awesome bacon (sherry, maple, parsley), the steak and potatoes (citrus, cream), asparagus and egg (melted Parmesan), and finished with the unreal cornbread.\n\nFor drinks, I had a glass of red wine, followed by the irresistible Cigarettes & Coffee libation... rye. smoke. coffee. I never order whiskey, but this masterfully-mixed concoction has me wanting to go back for more!! Well, it and all the mind-blowing great food :)\n\nDark and romantic, but hip and cool.

Last visit we shared the leek and potato pancakes served with a jicama and pomegranate salad, and wished there was more to go around.  Also ordered the sampler platter for the table, the star of which was the tomato jam - it was out of this world. For entrees we ordered the linguine and cauliflower (a bit underwhelming), the chanterelle tart (wonderful), and the brochettes (perfectly adequate, but not as good as the tart or appetizers).

I hadn't eaten at Greens for over 10 years and ironically was invited to dinner there tonight.  I guess I had mainly eaten lunch there, since I remember their salads and tofu sandwiches, but tonight's Prix Fixe menu was much more innovative.\nI enjoyed the Risotto Griddle Cake (with red curry sauce) appetizer and wild mushroom ravioli entree.  Also sampled the Wilted Spinach Salad with Asian Pear and the Butternut Squash crepes with a Thai influence.  However, my Huckleberry Upside Down Cake with Meyer Lemon Ice Cream was just okay, since I wished the cake had a lighter texture (it was more of a shortcake/biscuit).  But the combination of lemon and huckleberries was a delicious complimentary pairing.\nThe service was excellent and we had a picture postcard view of the Golden Gate Bridge at sunset.

But this does not apply to Greens. Nicely located in Fort Mason, the restaurant shares the amazing bay view as the Marina waterfront. Greens prepare their dishes with seasonal ingredients throughout the year, as well as some fixed dishes in their menu. They have a good selection of beverages that include wine, beers, and tea, just to name a few.\n\nWhile most evenings they serve bread and butter, others you'll be served home-roasted salted almonds that are so good, you wanted more! But don't, because the food you ordered will be on your table soon, and you will want to make room for that (plus dessert too!) I'm unable to be specific on the dishes this time, but whatever it is that you ordered from the menu, it will be guaranteed to be tasty.\n\nI have come back for more than five times to Greens, and I will definitely return again.

It is the Mecca for West Coast vegetarians, the restaurant that really brought vegetarian cooking on par with other fine dining.\n\nGreens originally opened as part of the SF Zen Center, and the feeling still remains.  Located in a converted warehouse, almost floor-to-ceiling windows give stunning views of Marina, and on less foggy days, of the Marin Headlands and the Golden Gate.  \n\nChef Annie Somerville is known for pushing the envelope on vegetarian cooking, and for using only the freshest, in season ingredients.

And the food at Green's is great, in fact. It also has one of the best views in the city, the marina, the beautiful bridge. I've had lunch here on several occasions, and on Sunday we had a delightful brunch here. The service was excellent, coffee cups were always full and the food was excellent. We started with the fresh fruit and yogurt, a combination of grapefruit, blood orange, medjool dates, and fresh pineapple. Then scrambled eggs with Macheego Cheese, chives and yukon gold potato's. It was a wonderful. The Mimosa's were delicious. And I for one, think the atmosphere is spectacular. A large loft like space that is light and airy, the redwood tables and beautiful windows only add to the gorgeous view. The only reason I give this four stars is that it can be a bit out of my price range, but for brunch it was pretty reasonable. I didn't even notice the lack of meat on the menu.

The Choy Kway Teow was filled with an assortment of different toppings like shrimp, fish cake, and bean sprouts. You can adjust the spiciness to your liking, but we just asked for some spicy sauce on the side. The Curry had two different types of bean curd (one dry and one that had stuffing), fishcake, and eggplant. It paired well with rice, but was a tad salty. It isn't very spicy so it's a good option for people who are bad with spicy foods (like me). The Chicken was soft, smooth, and strangely refreshing. The Sarange Burong is taro fried and shaped into a bowl and filled with celery and chicken. The taro was flavorful and was fried per order. Came out piping hot and was not greasy at all.\n\ndefinitely look forward to visiting again", "WHOA this place is good and super affordable, we got the roti and kueh teow and curry and some veggies with little dried shrimps and it was SO good and less than $12 a person! for so much food!! i wish there was a restaurant like this near my a) home and b) work. the service was a little bit slow, but the restaurant was packed, and our waitress was SO nice and apologetic. such is life, yeah?", "I wouldn't say this place is spectacular... but it's still good.

I was hoping that it'd be the super fluffy (copious amounts of ghee/ butter) roti that I was craving, but it fell flat.\n\nI also understand that nasi lemak basically means fat rice, because it is cooked in coconut milk. However the folks at NM serve this with steamed rice, which is actually Nasi lemak kukus.

The scallop ceviche is a generous appetizer portion that comes in a salt-rimmed margarita glass and beautifully blends citrus flavors with luscious scallops.  The salad -- a similarly generous portion -- features tender grilled octopus (tender and octopus are not words usually heard together, but in RIS' case, the octopus is truly divine), Greek yogurt and olive oil.\n\nRIS features daily specials and I've never had a bad dish here.

There's usually a long wait outside during the dinner hours, but you can get a bite during lunch relatively easy if you don't mind sharing a table with spice enthusiast strangers. After all, you're there to get the job done: eat spicy food.\n\nIf you enjoy spicy food and Chinese food, this is your spot. They have a notorious reputation for some of the spiciest Chinese dishes in the area, and I assure you that appellation is well deserved. From classic dishes you're used to like Mapo Tofu, Kung Pao Chicken, and dan dan noodles to the less familiar items like mutton cumin with tooth picks and beef braised in hot chili oil, most dishes here feature a distinct and bold level of chili spice. Yesterday I had 5 dishes and it ran the bill to $67~ (not including tip). It was enough food for 4-5 people, so it was a great value for dinner in my book.\n\nFavorites include tooth-pick skewered mutton with cumin, water boiled fish in green pepper broth, beef boiled in hot chili oil and chilies, and the cold noodles with garlic sauce.\n\nI will definitely be back to explore more of the menu in the future!", "This is a bit of a tough one.\n\nThe food is pretty good, the wait isn't too horrendously awful, and parking, well, it's doable.\n\nIt's pretty authentic Sichuan (at least to me), and the mung bean noodles as well as the dan dan noodles are both excellent, complete with a very intense heat that doesn't show up til after the first few bites.\n\nToothpick lamb isn't all that spicy and is superb, as is the beef that we had-- although the beef could definitely be very spicy if you were ambitious. A fish (soup-ish) seemed great and not all that spicy unless you opted to dip deep into the chiles in the soup base; it was change of pace for flavors.\n\nEggplant wasn't spicy, more sweetish, but wasn't very interesting in the end. We thought that and the fish would be a nice change, but in reality it didn't quite work-- the meal was fundamentally still sort of the one-trick SIchuan spice, and that's what makes the rating tough. That and a strangely slow delivery of our toothpick lamb; most dishes came out very quickly, but the toothpick lamb took forever...\n\n3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4.", "Chengdu Taste has always been a solid restaurant specializing in Sichuan-style dishes. Sichuan food is, by appearance, red, doused in spicy red peppers, and numbing from its characteristic ingredient, the sichuan peppercorn.\n\nThis particular visit, my group and I had the Crispy rice beef, fried intestine, boiled white fish in spicy red sauce, toothpick lamb, eggplant, and mung bean jelly. Each dish had its own personality, utilizing the red peppers and sichuan peppers to accentuate its meat and vegetables. The standout was the toothpick lamb and boiled white fish in spicy red sauce!\n\nThe service was swift, although our orders were hard to hear over the conversations of a packed house. This is definitely a plus to its testament of being a popular place to dine.\n\nThis place does not shy away from highlighting the sichuan peppercorn in its dishes, so first-timers, be prepared for a numbing experience! Drinking water becomes interesting!", "To be frank I am very particular when it comes to spicy foods. I joined several friends here for lunch and, since they were regular diners here, I let them order.  I've dined at Szechuan restaurants before, but this was my first time at this establishment.\n\nFor me the spicy food that was ordered was over the top. The toothpick lamb was so spicy I really had to pass on it.  On the other hand the kung pao chicken was less spicy and delicious  The won ton with pepper sauce was also high on the spice level but I enjoyed it very much.\n\nMy suggestion is to ask before ordering. My guests didn't ask me if I liked spicy food and they felt bad after we finished. They told me anything on the menu can be ordered with mild spice. If I return I'll definitely make that request.\n\nAs for parking, there was none available on the street or in the rear. I parked across the street about a half/block away. Not a problem - I like to walk. But if you find a close spot consider yourself very lucky.\n\nAll-in-all not a bad experience. I learned a bit about ordering in a Chinese restaurant known for spicy foods.", "Excellent authentic Chengdu cuisine. Prices are super affordable for the amount of food they give you. Everything is very flavorful. Love Love their spicy boiled fish, that will be forever my favorite! One less star because it can be a bit difficult to find and parking can be a b*tch, but they are in the same plaza as Mcdonalds. I heard this place can be pretty packed, but I went on a Sunday night and got seated right on the spot. Love this place!", "Their food is ok. By the service is the worst. The waiter and waitress just pass by u by bumping your shoulder. No smile on the face. When all of us feels a chicken dish is not fresh. I asked the waiter when did they made the dish. He stare at me with only 4 inches from my face and told me with an intimidation voice. \"We just made it after u ordered!\" This is totally a lie. Bc that dish can not be cooked within 15 minutes.

The chicken is so soft and the sauce is PERFECT- goes well with the garlic rice and the naan.\nZucchini Kofta - the zucchini dumplings are a really interesting and a yummy dish to try. I would say it's comparable to eating eggplant parmesan without cheese, and with a meld of indian and hot spices, but the overall sauce really reminded me of tomato sauce.\nChicken biryani - another crowd favorite. It was a generous helping. It came with a side of yogurt that was a great pairing with the rice. The chicken in this dish was super good and had its own flavor to it as well.\n\nOverall, food was fantastic, the service and staff delightful.

There was nothing really distinctive about the space. There were about 10 seats lining the chef's section, a large private room in the back, and a bar when you first enter.\n\nThe food was ok - but seemed to be missing a lot of the flavor and was a bit pricey for what you ultimately received. Some of the staff seemed a bit unsure of the dishes and the kulfi dessert was frozen and not your typical consistency.

I called in advance and made reservations for much. This restaurant has a very cozy and trendy ambiance. I loved sitting inside and just enjoyed the experience.\n\nFor food, we ordered the following:\n- Tiger's Tail: one of the two non-alcoholic drinks offered. I should have gotten the other one as this was a bit too spicy and strong for me.\n- Tamarind Potato Sphere: this is what we call golgappe in traditional Indian restaurants. I loved it.\n- Green Pea and Edamame Tikki: this was ok for me. It lacked a bit of spice for me. I understand this was a modern take to the traditional tikki, but I could have used some chutney with this.\n- Zucchini Kofta: I loved that this was not the traditional Malai Kofta. Loved the way this was cooked and tasted.\n- Side of Palak Paneer: I ordered this for my son. I do wish there was a smaller size of this side dish.\n- Lachcha Paratha: loved the way how this was presented and tasted.\n\nOverall, great place to hang out and dine. The options on the menu are limited, but the food tasted great. Definitely go try this out.", "Wow what great Indian meal.  I am an Indian.  It reminds me of Indian food in England.  Quality of ingredients are outstanding and it makes all the difference.  Trust me when I make my review.  Not what you experience at other Indian restaurants. Especially indian buffet are not known for quality as one can imagine.  First of all, you don't feel you smell of indian curry as soon as you walk in.  We brought our 7 year old twins with us. My kids appreciated the Malai chicken, butter chicken and the garlic naan.  Honestly our kids rarely appreciate Indian outside our house cos my wife is a great cook. We will surely frequent this place.  We are in DC another 4 days.  Our experience has been so good that we feel we will be back at least once but a few more times before we head back.  Being Indian we feel this is the best of Indian in DC.  This was even better than Rasika we had yesterday.  We really miss good Indian in Dallas where we are from.  Before I forget, cocktails were awesome too.  Do try their classic old fashioned and Gimlet.  Our kids enjoyed Rose Lemonade.", "The food was meh.  The wild mushroom and truffle oil naan was disappointing. Could not smell or taste any truffle. Usually, when you get truffle, if you're not careful, it will overwhelm the entire dish. We were told that white truffle oil was used, verses black truffle oil.\n\nThe cauliflower and chicken were good. We later got the garlic naan, which was very good. We also ordered the palak paneer, which had absolutely no seasoning. Had to ask for salt and pepper.\n\nCocktails were average.\n\nCustomer service, while good, was slow. Almost missed the last bus back to VA.", "Stopped in on a Friday night with a group of 4 and decided to sit in the bar area (we didn't have a reservation).  Service was attentive and quick and cocktails were solid - great bartender!  We ordered a selection of items to share, with the quinoa salad and butter chicken being standouts.

UPDATE: went again in June 2020 and got the cashew chicken and it was horrible. :/ really have tried giving this place multiple chances but I've had to throw out my food more than once.

I was a little shocked that a Panang curry with tofu would cost more than $20 after tax and tip, but I ordered it anyway. But when I got home, I discovered they didn't include any rice with the curry. Who does that?! They didn't mention anything about adding on rice when I ordered over the phone, and I just (wrongly) assumed (apparently) that rice would be included since it is included in EVERY THAI RESTAURANT I'VE EVER BEEN TO! And coming from the Pacific Northwest, I've been to plenty! So I was less than thrilled to pay that much money for a curry, which also didn't include any veggies like peppers, and have no rice to put it on. It tasted good, well, it's hard to mess up Panang curry, but I really think they should have included rice with it, or at least told me that I needed to order it extra (which I really shouldn't have to do that because it should just come with it automatically!

I was conflicted between getting the Uni Udon or the Miso Carbonara Udon, but ended up playing safe and sticking with the Miso Carbonara. It was super creamy and light at the same time, the udon noodles were perfectly chewy and bouncy. They give a generous amount of bacon which added a little salty kick to each bite you take!\n\nMy friend got their Uni Udon which I got to try a bit of and it was pretty okay, the Uni flavor was very very light. Still just as creamy as my Miso Carbonara but was not really rich in the uni flavor. Maybe it's because they ran out of uni pieces to top it off with like how they usually would (or as seen in pictures).\n\nAlso got to try a bit of my cousin's Gratin Udon which comes in a little cute skillet. His dish actually almost made me want to switch mine out! It was super cheesy and packed with rich creaminess and had little bits of chicken!\n\nEverything was definitly worth it, Uni Udon could've been a bit better but everything else was amazing!

There were about six parties in front of us when we lined up close to 6p on a Monday.\n\nThe workers all spoke Japanese which was very refreshing, and the inside was super cozy. I like my noodles thin and firm (yes, even udon lol) but unfortunately because they make everyone's orders in the same batch I couldn't modify the firmness.\n\nI got the Miso Carbonara since it was listed as one of the most popular items, and I'm a sucker for anything creamy - especially carbonara.\nThe miso flavor was very very VERY subtle - I couldn't taste it until the last few bites. The dish is overall very creamy and slightly sweet, but the bits of salty bacon help balance out the sweetness. I noticed that the handmade noodles themselves are also on the sweeter side.\n\nthe Assorted Tempura was beautiful fried and came with a shrimp, fish, shiitake mushroom, eggplant and two shiso leaves. The oil that they used was clean and the tempura didn't feel too oily.", "PSA the creamy tomato seafood udon is finally back!! I have been awaiting it's return since the beginning of Covid in 2020 and I'm happy to say that it tastes exactly as I remember. I'm already looking forward to the next time I visit so that I can inhale another bowl of this delicious udon.\n\nPalette wise, I'd say the creamy tomato seafood udon is quite flavorful! It has a creamy base but at the same time the tomato makes it a bit acidic, which pairs well with the seafood flavor/shrimp flavor! If you're not too big of a fan of shrimp, I wouldn't suggest this soup. Not that there's a lot of shrimp pieces in the udon but the shrimp flavor is strong. Also, the home made udon pasta is the perfect texture!

Would definitely recommend heading there about 15-20 mins before their opening time (12pm) because we did not expect there to be such a crowd given that it was also raining pretty heavily.\n\nWe managed to be seated in the first wave and service was also pretty quick. We ordered 3 items: 1. Miso Carbonara Udon; 2. Mentai Butter Squid Udon; 3. Mentai Cream Seafood Udon. These were all served in huge bowls but the portion itself wasn't huge. Despite the slightly smaller portion sizes, the richness of the sauces definitely made us full. I fully enjoyed my Miso Carbonara Udon; it was creamy and flavorful and definitely umami because of the miso which was subtle, but there.\n\nOverall, I would say that the dishes were pretty good at their price points ~$19 per person including tip. I saw many people ordering the Uni Cream Udon so I might want to go back and try that too. It was a comforting meal for a rainy day in Little Tokyo.", "Being in the area, it's given that I have to swing by my favorite udon place! With the new COVID protocols, the restaurant requires to see your vaccination status + ID before being seated, which I think is a great idea for the safety of everyone.\nI came back to eat their Pork Curry Udon ($12) and added their jumbo shrimp tempura ($3). This pairing goes very well together because you can dip the tempura into the curry sauce and it is SOOO good!!! I notice that they changed their noodles, it has a flatter shape rather than round. But it is still handmade, and absolutely delicious! Love love love this place still :)", "Typical Japanese udon joint with very good udon.

Can take either of these any day of the week. The wakame and Sansai are good as well, lighter version but full of flavor.\n\nKaraage and Tempura are perfect companions for our sake.

Sop up the incredible sauce with Grassano\u2019s lip-smacking bread, baked in-house and served warm from the wood-burning oven.", "yelp_reviews": ["Personally, when I think of great restaurants in Chicago, I really don't think of Hyde Park. But with places like Nella, I'm willing to admit that maybe I was wrong.\nThe name of the game is Neapolitan style pizza. I went with the classic Margherita and was not disappointed: it had bright and sharp tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and basil, a wet and dripping middle surrounded by a fluffy, chewy crust. Plus, to my delight, the pizza was generously sized and reasonably priced. My only wish would be more basil, please!\nI also split an arugula salad with my dining companion, which was simply dressed with lemon, olive oil, and freshly shaved Parmesan. He got a mushroom and zucchini truffle pizza, which it an awesome alternative if you don't like red sauce as much.\nService was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry so I didn't mind. The busboy was really nice and friendly though, so props to him! (If management cares to identify him and pass on the compliment, we visited on Saturday 3/9 for lunch.)", "I'm not Italian, but I love Italian food. This place is authentic, and reading a lot of the reviews it seems that people who enjoy authentic Italian food love this place. The pizza is always fresh and cooked well, and the pasta is delicious. They have a lot of seafood options.\n\nI've enjoyed the service, and the servers are often Italian. The space has a modern vibe, consistent with restaurants in larger cities in Italy. It can get loud, which is the way things are with this aesthetic.\n\nThis isn't your old neighborhood Italian place, and that's ok. It's a light filled, vibrant place with locals, college kids, faculty and staff from the University, and even the occasional North sider will venture to our neighborhood for a great bite of gnocchi or risotto.", "My partner and I went to dinner at around 7:30 on a Wed and were served by the very attentive Ciro! It was our first time here and were excited to try one of the only Bib Gourmand restaurants in Hyde Park.\n\nWe ordered the polpette and the calamari fritti for appetizers. They were both fantastic starts to our meal!\n\nFor the entrees we ordered the Amalfi Pizza and the PAPPARDELLE AL RAG\u00d9 DI AGNELLO. We could tell the ingredients and preparation were done extremely well, however, next time we'll be trying different dishes. The lamb had a strong flavor and seemed to overpower the pasta, while the goat cheese also had a strong hold on the pizza. We still finished off both plates though, so I think that just comes down to personal flavor preferences.\n\nWill definitely return and try more things off the menu!", "I was starving and this place came to the rescue. I was worried the pizza might take awhile to make but it took a total of maybe 5 minutes between ordering and getting my pizza. They cook the pizza in a 900 degree brick oven so it is extremely fast. I got the cavani pizza, which was full of various kinds of meat. It was okay, definitely not the best pizza I've ever had nor the worst. I think it could have used more sauce and the cheese  could have been spread out more evenly. It was also quite heavy on the sausage compared to the other meats so the balance of the pizza overall was off. The bread was very chewy, if you enjoy that, and had a nice burnt flavor. I still think the flavor was decent enough for me to come back and try some other pizzas. I do think it is quite expensive for the size though. It is a very small pizza with a thin crust that cost $20 not including tax. It definitely didn't fill me up and left me still hungry so if you are looking for something cheaper and more fulfilling then I wouldn't go here. Otherwise it is a decent place for specialty pizza.", "Best Italian restaurant in Chicago!  Homemade pasta and gnocchi were perfect and as good as the restaurants that I went to in Italy.  The desserts were the icing on the cake.  Try pouring a fresh shot of expresso over homemade ice cream and you will be blown away!", "Overall i enjoyed the lunch experience. Had one of the pizza's. Crust was very good and the wood burning brick oven gave it a great taste, chewy and savory. Also had an appetizer, bruschetta with black truffle pate, The cheese and tomatoes were savory and fresh.", "Nella is super solid modern Italian in Hyde Park. It is admittedly on the pricey side, but the pastas are definitely a step up.\n\nI got a pappardelle dish with braised lamb which was fantastic. Al dente pappardelle with deliciously savory lamb ragu.\n\nI will definitely be checking this place out again. They have good lunch portions and specials as well.", "This was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Food, service, and atmosphere were all five star!\nThe Nella DOP Pizza was amazing. The crust was perfect and the toppings were all so fresh and flavorful.\nThe Penne Arrabbiata was perfect. Spicy, fresh, and the pasta had a perfect texture. You won't be disappointed with this meal.\nI can't wait to go back and try more. We live about 45 mins away but I think we will be back often.", "Sadly I bought takeout frm here last week, ordered and paid for multiple items including the gnocchi with seafood entree- got home & realized to my horror that there was no gnocchi.

The Bloomingdales area is really coming into their own.\n\nThe Red Hen has a great vibe and the atmosphere is really quaint. The menu has a great selection of pastas and meats. I had the braised beef with broccoli and it fell apart against my fork - I think that's called cooked to perfection. My friend had the scallops with kale - which I kept stealing away. The scallops had a perfect chat on the outside but we're still moist on the inside. We also started with s salad consisting of cheese and veggies - I forget the detail - and it was awesome. The wine selection was extensive and what I had was super tasty.\n\nAs for service, I have only sat at the bar, but I found the bartender to be helpful and encouraging while going through the menu. This is import because it is almost impossible to get a reservation! I think 6 to 8 weeks out you can only get a 9 pm table on a Tuesday. They say they keep room for walk-ins, but I've tried three times and only got a bar seat once. But it's worth it and that is why I stayed at 5 stars. I'm also told it's easier to walk in closer to opening... So I'll keep trying that.", "Been reading about how good this place is for some time now and finally tried it for dinner last night. Well, I'm here to tell you Red Hen lives up to its press. The atmosphere is warm, cozy and inviting. Think wood, exposed brick and the subtle smell of smoke. Start with an interesting cocktail from the bar. Once you're seated, there's complimentary sparkling water, bread and an olive tapenade. Service is warm, knowledgeable and professional. The wine list is interesting and well priced. If you've ever wanted to try \"orange wine\", this is the place. If you're an adventurous wine drinker, I suggest you do. The food is delicious and speaks of Italy. We had ricotta bruschetta and octopus to start. Both fantastic! A mid course of pasta is a must. Cacio e Pepe isn't on the menu, but always available and will transport you to a Roman trattoria. Unctuous short ribs and chicken fra diavolo were both superb. Had no room for dessert, but an after dinner drink topped off a spectacular meal. Red Hen, you're my new favorite Italian restaurant in DC. Oh and did I mention the prices are quite reasonable for a dining experience of this calibre?", "We were going to an event near this terrific restaurant, which has been on our list, and were lucky enough to snag a table.  I loved the rustic/modern atmo and the food was delicious, so I look forward to our next visit, when we have more time to explore the menu.\n\nThe WaPo had just mentioned their arancini with basil aioli in an article on 'Cacio e Pepe' riffs, and it was the best version of that popular appetizer I've ever had.  The Spring Pea Shoot salad was so good I wished I had it all to myself, and the pastas were tasty and steaming hot.  Reports about their rigatoni are right -- it was full of meat and very satisfying.  We all liked our pastas, except that the cavatelli was too salty.  (Kitchen -- take Note.)   We were all wiping our plates with the house bread, also good.  Not everyone offers it these days, which I think is a shame -- to me, good bread is often a sign of more good things to come.\n\nPS  This place has NOTHING to do with the restaurant that asked Sarah Huckabee Sanders to leave.", "I know The Red Hen is supposed to be known for their pasta, but they do toast better. The sourdough bread is great sourdough bread- the radishes were forgettable and unnecessary. If you have to choose one toast go for the chicken liver mousse, it is a lovely marriage of sweet and savory.\n\nOther dishes we ordered:\nAntipasto:\nArancini 'Cacio e Pepe'- this was done well, the highlight was the herb aioli\n\nPasta:\nMafalde- solid choice, well- balanced flavors\nMezzi rigatoni- lots of sausage in this dish, which is great but the sauce was overpowering\n\nThe pasta dishes were good, not great. All in all, it was a nice experience. I'll be back to try more (read: ALL) toast!", "Despite the hype, this place lives up to its reputation! If you can manage to score a table that is. If not, grab a seat at the bar. Really enjoyed the Tuscan Chicken Liver Mousse and the Burrata with Chickpea & Beluga Lentil Salad, but we especially liked the Grilled Octopus with Cauliflower! For mains, we had the Grilled Beef Short Rib, which was succulent and the Ricotta Cavatelli with Spicy Lamb Sausage, the ultimate comfort pasta dish! The only complaint, and this has nothing to do with the restaurant, are folks with their screaming babies in tow. Please leave your toddlers at home (with a baby sitter)! It's the right thing to do.", "The Red Hen is one of my favorite spots for Italian in DC. I love the warm and cozy feel of the space.

They were super attentive and made sure that everything was great.", "My mother suggested I try this place because she watched Lilly Singh take the Try Guys here!\n\nTheir Samosas are delicious. Both the traditional and butter chickens ones SO SO SO tasty. They were fresh and flavorful and I would've loved to eat nothing but a million of them for dinner. We also got the homestyle punjabi sabzi and badmaash fried chicken with rice. Both dishes were great! I didn't love the serrano cream sauce that came with the chicken but the chicken was yummy on its own so that didn't matter.\n\nFor dessert we got their Mango Mousse with Raspberry sauce.

Although the service toward the beginning was somewhat slow, our waiter was very friendly and accommodating. Quick note: try to reserve the sunset room cause the vibes and views are WAYYY nicer.\nWhipped eggplant (9/10) - the pita bread was nice and fluffy but the star of the show was obviously the eggplant dip. It was creamy and rich like butter. The flavor profile is very unique and definitely worth a try. MUST ORDER\nMargherita pizza (8/10) - the most basic dish of the night yet still made with quality. it's exactly what you expect for a Neapolitan thin crust pizza at a fancy italian restaurant. not the star but still tasty\nVodka pasta (8.5) - probably some the best vodka pasta i've ever had. it was rich and creamy while hanging onto a sweet tanginess. the pasta noodles were al debate and hid little pockets of sauce that would burst in your mouth. a MUST-GET pasta here", "We celebrated our anniversary 1 week late. The reception at the entrance lacked warmth or a welcoming spirit. In any case, took the elevator and were seated in the \"cactus garden\" towards the back.

In any case, the server was friendly, funny, and efficient.\n\n\u00c9lephante is basically a bar catering to millennials, Xers and GenY as a place to hang out and sip $16 cocktails. As such, it ticks all the boxes for the requisite noise, setting, and service. We were not expecting much food wise, thus our pleasant surprise that the food was quite good. The grilled octopus was just right, not too soft or chewy. The gulf shrimp was a bit spicy but also good. The baba ghanoush came with a puffy bread straight from the pizza oven that hit the spot.

They've put together everything perfectly with special attention to detail.\n\nThe ocean view is beautiful and relaxing, and the vibes are very chill. The food is also extremely tasty and delicious, absolutely nothing to complain about. We got the avocado toast with two poached eggs, the breakfast pizza, and the gulf shrimp. The gulf shrimp had to be my favorite, the sauce on top with the side chili was amazing, definitely something I'm going to order again. The breakfast pizza with the egg cream is also so so good. I thought it would just be another pizza with an egg on top, but I was so wrong! Definitely get this.\n\nThe prices are fair, and I have no doubts about coming back here.

However, it is a little small plate, order 1 plate for 1-2 people. The Gemelli pasta is to be avoided. Vodka sauce pasta was so-so. Fried calamari was decent.\n\nDeserts - avoid it. Pavlova was over powering with passion fruit (chefs, little is more sometimes) Chocolate Torta was just blah.\n\nBottom line - go for the sunset view, drinks and appetizers. Dinner/Desert is so-so and over priced.", "Was pleasantly surprised with this place. We got seated right away, although we were a bit late for our resi. Had a very sweet waiter who took care of us and we ordered few appetizers to share. The tiger prawns - delicious, highly suggest. The whipped eggplant which is served with their fantastic Puccia bread - yum. Big eyed tuna crudo was a hit and I loved it.

We split the Lobster Bisque, and it was amazing! It was creamy and had bits of bacon(?) and mushrooms in it. We both ordered the Marine Room Signature - Black Angus Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail. The filet mignon was unfortunately a bit overcooked, but the flavor was still really good. The lobster tail was cooked perfectly, and it went really well with the cream that they gave us.

It has only a few choices of mains and appetizers that makes it easy to us to decide on what we're gonna order.\n\nOrdered Roasted Young Chicken - $22 , it was really good, not too oily and meat is tender, served with a generous portion of vegetables 8/10.\n\nAlso ordered Cassolet (with duck confetti, lamb and sausage, butter beans and garlic bread crumbs)- $26. An interesting dish with a mix of different kinds of meat, would recommend this if you're a meat lover!\n\nAlso ordered Southwest Tamale (with chipotle pulled pork and chili). It was good at the first few bites but eventually it taste more like a pie that I can prepare it at home.\n\nWill be back to try the brunch menu that most yelpers has been raving about. Dinner was ok, not much to rave about.", "My girlfriend and I made it to Grace's Table for the first time and the only regret was not coming here sooner. It's a little spot with a big heart and lots of great things. The two of us fell in love with this place as soon as we got there. The service was top notch and the food was a treat as well. I got the eggs benedict, which came with Canadian bacon, artisan English muffin, herb hollandaise, peperonata and potato cake. The additions of fresh fruit was also a delight. It was a balanced filling meal with added sweetness from the fruit and beautifully done eggs. We'll surely be back!", "We were very disappointed by the breakfast at this restaurant.  The sausage was lacking in any discernible flavor--tasted like ground chicken without any spices.  Chilaquiles was ok.....nothing to brag about.  The worst thing was their house brewed coffee.  I couldn't even finish my cup...and I usually have 3 cups every morning.  Service was friendly and the restaurant itself is cute.  Server graciously replaced bland sausage with some bacon.

I haven't been to a banquet style dinner for more than a year.\n\nSeafood soup - good chunks of seafood in a nicely balanced slur of yumminess.\nSalt and pepper squid - huge pieces of squid with perfect amount of batter.

I also loved their egg custard bun which was piping hot and fresh.\n\nAs always, the cart pushers are pretty aggressive but totally friendly and nice.

For post pandemic re-opening, they no longer have parties sharing a big dining table but keep distance between tables and the pushy carts ladies are back - with great varieties of small plates or I should say small bamboo steamers. To name a few of my favorite dim sum dishes - siu mai, raddish cakes, stuffed eggplant, and tofu skin roll. They are consistent every time.\n\nDon't miss the Cantoness banquet style dinner either. Although I usually don't have large companies but it is still enjoyable for smaller parties. My favorites are classic cantoness staples such as pan fried flounder, chow fun with beef, ginger and scallion lobsters, tofu stew with seafood.

He attended in details and serve with professionalism.", "Solid Chinese seafood restaurant in Flushing better known for its dim sum, but we swung by here to check out its regular menu items for dinner!

Broiled Oysters - really meaty oysters with an interesting green garlic and herb glacage and lardo.  This was a great way to start the meal.\n\n(2).  Crispy Hen of the Woods Mushroom with Sour Cream 'n' Allium Dip - this was something they brought from Lazy Bear and is their most popular dish.  I can see why and this is something I would order every time I'm here.\n\n(3).  Dry-Aged Pork Roast with Country Ham XO Sauce - the XO sauce on the pork turned this into an elevated version of a humble dish I used to have in the Philippines (cubed pork with shrimp paste). Really excellent.\n\n(4).  Fig Leaf Ice Cream with Caramelized Figs - this is a Michelin quality dessert. Loved this.\n\nA non-alcoholic Shirley Temple was my pairing for the evening.

If you're looking for that thin Italian style pizza, you'll love it here. If you love Rubirosa in NYC like I do, you will for sure love it here. They even have an \"Ode to Rubirosa\" pie which is basically their version of the Tie Dye from Rubirosa (vodka sauce, mozzarella, pesto), it's exceptional. Also delicious, their shaved Brussels sprout salad. It's super simple and so tasty. I hate it when a salad is overdressed, but theirs is dressed perfectly. We also ordered the meatballs, which were good meatballs if not a bit salty for my tastes, but the shining star was the accompanying focaccia toast. Lightly crispy and doughy and buttered OMG I could eat that all day.\n\nLimited reservations available on Resy, which I suppose is temporarily obsolete through the rest of March if not longer (can you even remember what we talked about before coronavirus??). Trust that I will be getting my pizza fix via delivery!", "And my pizza journey continues. Pizzeria Bebu is fairly new and is rated as one of the best thin crusts in Chicago. I came here last Thursday night and had a 7pm reservation. It was actually quite busy at that time so a reservation was a good call. The ambience was a clean airy environment as they had the windows open. They also had outdoor seating. Bebu could probably sit about 40 people. The music was overly loud though.\n\nWe ordered the burrata as an appetizer and split a bottle of the Cabernet Sauvignon. The burrata was pretty good and it came with an arugula salad. Since Bebu has a lot of different types of pizza, we ended up going half Ode to Rubirosa and half Jalapeno Business. The toppings and ingredients were awesome. They were fresh and had a ton of flavor. The pizza was about 12 inches so decent size and was good for 2 people. The crust was slightly charred and I didn't particularly care for the cornicione because it was somewhat burnt. But the pizza was very good overall.  \n\nOverall, Pizzeria Bebu had very good pizza and I am a fan! Prices weren't overly outrageous and the ambience was pretty sleek. It does get crowded so it's better to go during off peak times. I will definitely be back!", "Had a fantastic dinner here with a group of 12 this past Saturday. When I first called to make the reservation they were having a maintenance issue and weren't sure if they'd be open. The manager was super nice and took my name & number and called me back later to let me know everything was fixed and they could accommodate our group.\n\nThe restaurant is just one long stretch of tables against the windows, nice and cozy without feeling crowded. Our server was really friendly and definitely went the extra mile to take care of our group. They had an unexpectedly awesome beer list too, with bottles from Off Color, Moody Tongue and Temperance.  \n\nPizzas are rather large, so 2 people per pie is a good estimate. We ordered a bunch of different ones and I have to say everything was phenomenal!! The sausage/pepper special, the meatball with ricotta and the prosciutto with greens stood out. You really can't go wrong!\n\nCan't say enough good things about Pizzeria Bebu. Can't wait to go back!", "Our long awaited visit to Bebu was worth it. The pizza was incredible. Almost a mix between Neopolitan and New York styles. We got the hot Daisy. It was basically a very spicy version of a Margherita Pizza. The only gripe we had was that it was a little too spicy. But the Chili's provide a good, deep spice flavor. Anyway, they made two lifelong Bebu consumers."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bebu-chicago?hrid=ylAnNGoXMAMPJH9WE8Sn-w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bebu-chicago?hrid=2tVaaj75hdvWmytyINcJJA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bebu-chicago?hrid=Fl1BsFEADnJRgGj5RxyzWg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bebu-chicago?hrid=WbbFGNJdsarkOu-nKJciEQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bebu-chicago?hrid=WBU_lK439KKp0hRh5vFUwg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bebu-chicago?hrid=HT1kUOpWR5s_HGgDYLXr_Q&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-bebu-chicago?hrid=cp7GrcUmxjFQV_UCdilGLQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Allora", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/allora-sacramento/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-sacramento/restaurant/allora", "michelin_pov": "Clean, modern and convivial, Allora is filled with the neighborhood feels, largely thanks to the owners\u2019 passion and dedication.

The bucatini came with plenty of Dungeness crab and topped with bread crumbs for texture. Don't expect whole pieces of sea urchin because it was mixed into the cream sauce making it understandable why the pasta had so much sauce. The cavatelli came with fantastic fennel sausage but the abundant amount of vegetal tomato sauce had too much oil. The dish might have been quickly improvised because it didn't have sweet corn or cured egg as stated on the menu.\n\nOddly, the seafood had sweet fruit. The halibut main dish had dates on top which was not a match with the delicious combination of red pepper sauce and hummus-like bean puree. Moroccan in style, the fregola bead-shaped pasta under the halibut was used like cous cous, but better. I liked everything about the scallop entr\u00e9e except the scallops. The scallops themselves had no problems but they didn't fit the rest of the excellent dish. The diced peaches on the scallop belonged with the fatty cubes of pork belly and the rich celery root puree while the scallops needed something tangy, peppery, or citrusy.\n\nThe wines by the glass weren't the typical selections and the cocktails were extremely tight and tart.", "We sat in the patio the first weekend this restaurant opened for business. Very comfortable, attentive service, and delicious food. We did think the portions were rather small, but spend enough money and you may fill up...the ticket out the door was about $100 per person. We stuck to wines by the glass ($11 per) since the wine\nlist, which is deep and interesting, is VERY expensive. I think the least expensive bottle I saw was $62ish and rose steeply from there.

I'm glad we did because the food was excellent. As we entered the dining room, we were warmly greeted by all the staff and chefs. It was a pretty cool feeling, because the restaurant was packed and they were all busy, but they all came to a halt to greet us. We sat at the bar and ordered the omakase which is the \"fishes of the day\" (~$40/person). It includes 8 pieces of super fresh, melt-in-your mouth fish.  The highlight of the night was the live octopus. It was my first time having live octopus and it was great. After finishing the piece, we were presented with a \"Japanese popcorn\", which was a deep fried octopus suction.\n\nOne interesting fact was that as traditional as the restaurant looked with its Japanese staff/chefs, no cellphone policy, interior design, and decor; this place has quite a few rolls on the menu.  \n\nThe staff was very polite and attentive.

I still prefer the sushi and style of sushi at Ikko. They do have a good assortment of fish from Japan and the staff was very helpful in describing them to us before ordering. There seems to always be a line, and that's appropriate seeing how small the restaurant is. Nothing special in their rolls, and to be honest the sushi, aside from the anago, was bland. They do give you soy sauce (unlike Ikko where the sauce is on your fish already) but they didn't give us wasabi or ginger. Considering that this place seems to be more on the lines of what typical sushi joints would serve I would think they would provide ginger and wasabi with sushi orders. They did when you ordered a roll.\n\nThe atmosphere is fun. The Sushi chefs were drinking and having a good time with the patrons. In all it's a nice spot and friendly environment, but would i consider the Sushi there the best...sadly no.", "I love Shunka. Sometimes there's a wait, sometimes you get lucky and get seated right away. But the wait is always worth it. The omakase is good and so fun to try whatever the chef wants to serve you. I've done this a couple times and have come up with my favorite fish list menu which is: shima aji, sea bream*, kamasu, suzuki, kintoki, scallop*, ocean trout*, yellowtail belly, sweet shrimp (opt for the fried head), scallop handroll on soy paper, and blue fin tuna. The other choices are also very tasty but these were my personal favorites. The fish can't get any fresher!! The crunch roll, shunka roll, and chawanmushi are also very oishi. I give 5 stars for the food quality, 5 stars for the chefs, 5 stars for the super nice staff, 5 stars for decor. Also mind the no phone policy.\n\nI came on Halloween and I LOVED the decorations!!

At the top of my head, I can't remember the two Japanese fish sushi I ate but both were phenomenal and came recommended by the server.

Everything was gorgeous! Definitely worth bringing out your phone and taking some pics. The taste was more than what we expected. All the sushi was the kind you'll remember and get cravings for. The salmon nigiri was some of the best I'd ever had: thick cuts of fresh fish with some perfectly-cooked rice. Who could ask for more?\n\nOsawa is definitely not the cheapest dinner I've had, but it may be one of the most memorable.

My only caveats have to do with the noise level and crowded venue, which are simply unavoidable consequences of being in a very high quality foodery in a small space.\n\nI was with a sophisticated party of three for food purposes.   We ordered a variety of menu items--two udon selections and a bento box.  We also shared two different desserts.   We all felt the food texture and quality were superb.   I particularly savored the salmon steak in my bento box selection.   One colleague mentioned the quality of the coconut broth in which his spicy green chili udon was served.   The other udon was based on chirashi, a Japanese assortment of fish and vegetables--also very tasty.  The garnishes were also fresh and pungent.\n\nThe dessert menu is eclectic--ranging from bread pudding to a yam brulee, and a black sesame panna cotta.  Mine was made from mochi balls covered with ice cream.  One thing that makes a good Japanese dessert is the ability to bring out a flavor without burying it in sweetness. These efforts did well at Osawa.  \n\nI'll have to come back several times to get the full range of possibilities here.

And authentic it was.\n\nWe ordered an two types of sashimi, the deluxe chirashi (a special for the day), and an assortment of sushi. Honestly I cannot really tell you what was what but everything was incredibly fresh. There was this one fatty salmon belly sushi I distinctly remember that melted in your mouth. It had red chili oil on it as well.\n\nThis place is apparently also know for Shabu Shabu but I didn't try it so I can't comment on it.

The standout item was the souffle - gargantuan and delicious, light and flavorful. Lobster ravioli was a bit of a disappointment - lots of lobster but the taste just isn't there. Foie gras was good.

Any poached egg dish is destined to be good but add French influence and presentation to it, it is lovely. I will also mention the olive bread and butter was sooo good.\nThe 4 cheese souffle was, of course, cheesy, with a crisp top, and a soft airy cheesy center. It was definitely filling and decadent but so worth it!\nThe chocolate souffle was a smaller portion and the perfect size for one person.

The pecorino cake was moist and almost like a dense souffle, though I thought it would have benefited from a accompanying sauce. Standout dishes for me were the vegetarian pici carbonora (no bacon for us, modifications easily accepted), the scallops and the rainwater madeira custard.

Out of all the dishes we had, I was truly blown away by a couple. The the brown rice bread was clearly the best of the appetizers.

You\u2019ll be able to taste the difference in the handmade corn tortillas that encase an oozy huitlacoche quesadilla, and the tender, citrusy carnitas.

The sikil pa'ak is something I've never had before, but the original recipe is unique and delicious. Everything is made from scratch, included the corn tortillas which are great and I always get extra.\n\nThe aesthetic of the restaurant easily matches the quality of the food. There are three separate spaces with slightly different decor, but they blend seamlessly together. It's clear that there isn't a single detail that wasn't thought about at least twice. The handmade art from Mexico is definitely something you won't see at other Mexican restaurants throughout the city, and you could come here forever without trying the endless varieties of authentic tequila and mezcal.\n\nFlores has easily become at least a twice monthly tradition for me and as they start serving lunch that will definitely increase. I can't recommend it enough!", "First experience was awesome and it's sometime rough around the edges but only because it's so popular and new...\n\nThe service out front is getting better and. Witter Thanks Luis!!\n\nThe guac is definitely different in April than it was in December and Jan and Feb. It's now *flavorless* and \"watered down\"-tasting. Maybe try ordering with jalape\u00f1o.\n\nThe spicy margarita needs more kick -- I set recommend some pointers from Mamacitas (RIP).\n\n[edit] I've since switched to super-skinny which adds an all natural kick\n\nThe carnitas is really good but often they really  go to town on the salt.\n\nBut because it's hot and trendy, this place is not about the service.

I have had really cool and helpful people.\n\nSo much potential!\n\nAim you expectations around Island Time and you're guaranteed to have a great time. They are always very busy and it's always a fun place! Let the service surprise you!!", "Alright people, this is it. Right in the heart of Cow Hollow, Flores is my new go-to spot for good, hearty Mexican food. I love a good taco, and let me tell you, their carnitas tacos are out of this world. I came with some family, and we ordered the Carnitas platter for about five of us, and it was the perfect portions to share between all of us. The meat was so tender, marinated with the perfect amount of smoky flavor, and tastes as fresh as it can get. Definitely a happening scene with a lot of young people around, so make sure that you get a reservation or come around happy hour time! Can't wait to be back :)", "This review is just for brunch, and it's just alright in my opinion. Some things are undeniable - the interiors are absolutely stunning. I love the colors on the walls, the fans in the front, and the whole vibe of the back room. We came for a late lunch and there was surprisingly no wait.\n\nHowever the vibes were off because I felt like the tables in the back were far too cramped together. My boyfriend and I were seated at a table where we were both just 1 foot away from the people at the table of 4 next to us. Not only was it awkward, but it felt very covid unsafe too. I tried to move to the next table over, but the waiters were pretty rude about not letting us do that, even though nobody showed up during our entire meal to take that table.\n\nThe chips and guac were average, but putting a bit of cheese on the guac - genius! The chilaquiles were yummy as well. But the vegetarian bowl was awfully bland and had no flavors to it.\n\nI feel like the food, service, and prices just didn't come together for me. If I were to come back, it might be just for a drink at the front of the house.", "We went here for brunch a couple of days before christmas so it was pretty slow that day, which was good. The service was excellent; our server was nice and attentive. I also liked the decor and the wall art; I thought it was a beautiful space.\n\nIn terms of the food, I thought they were pretty good. We started off with the guac and chips; they sprinkled the guac with cotija cheese, which made it a lil special. For my main course, I had the carne asada, which came with rice, beans, 2 eggs (any style you want), and of course corn tortilla. I thought they were pretty good; beef was grilled nicely (not over cooked), rice and beans were tasty, and the eggs were cooked just right. Finally for dessert, we had the churros. They were delicious! Perfectly fried, not greasy and tasted fresh, not to mention it came with a warm Mexican chocolate dipping sauce, yum!!", "Pricey but worth it, and one of the best upscale Mexican restaurants I've ever been to. The atmosphere is cozy, and there's lively chatter all around to ease you into conversation.\n\nThe mezcal margarita is delicious, and there's an extensive tequila selection to choose from. Additionally the duck confit enchiladas are great, especially with a side of the guac and cotija cheese. The wait is never as long as they say - once we went to a nearby pizza place because we were starving and told a 25 min wait, but they called us back while we were eating our pizza!\n\nDesserts look good here too, but I stuff myself with great Mexican food too much to enjoy it.

The tahini that accompanies the crisp, golden falafel is luscious, and a classic Greek salad is refreshingly satisfying. Don\u2019t fill up completely though, as the homemade baklava, which just so happens to be vegan, is sure to sate and is available packaged to go.", "yelp_reviews": ["I wish there were more stars to give this place. We went here after reading the reviews on Yelp.   Wow. It took us about 25 min to pick what to order as there were just so many options.  We ended up getting the Gyro combo and Chicken Schwarma, as well as the baba Ganoush.  The owner makes the most delicious Pita Bread that accompanies the meals.  It in itself is reason to go to the restaurant. For sure I have never had better Mediterranean food and I likely have never eaten better food in general, especially considering the price. The owner was also the cook, waiter and cashier and was definitely the sweetest guy. He brought us complimentary Baklava after dinner which was mouth watering.  The place is small so not really great for parties larger than 2-3 but he does a roaring takeout trade. If you are a party of 2, I suggest eating there- the place is adorable and actually appears to be part of his house. It's decorated quite authentically. I would seriously make a trip to Monterey just to eat at this place.", "been meaning to stop by here ...... and we finally made it for lunch last week.  It's a small, cozy space with about six tables.  The menu is pretty extensive, with choices of wraps for $5 or plates for $10.  Side Greek salad with wraps is $5 or a plate for $10.  \n\nI recommend the combination plates so you get tabouli, hummus, salad and main.  I had the kafta plate with rice and my husband had one of the vegetarian plates.  One pita is also included in the price and we ate so much we barely had room for the baklava.  \n\nThe baklava was diiferent from what we've had before - a little drier (making it crunchier !) and less sweet.  I actually prefer it now.  It is filled with walnuts or pecans or almond/chocolate !  Nice update on a classic dessert.  They also sell baklava to go, wrapped individually or in a plastic container.  \n\nNo alcohol is available, but there is a good variety of other drinks, including Turkish coffee.\n\nGreat value for great food.  Everything was fresh and tasty.", "The food here was absolutely perfect.  Our party was composed of 3 generations of vegetarians--age 2 to age 61, and everyone was super satisfied.  The presentation was beautiful and the tastes and textures were delightful.  We were tired after a day at the Monterey Aquarium and this was just the restorative meal we needed before our drive back to San Francisco.  Healthy and deeply satisfying.\nMy only suggestion for improvement would be to have the system of ordering be a bit more clear and for the person at the counter to provide more information at the beginning of the transaction.  For example, we were thirsty and wanted water to drink.  The counter person acknowledged the request but did not provide a way for us to get water.  When I returned to the counter after about 5 minutes she said, we will bring it to you.  The water did not arrive until the meal arrived which was after being there for about 10 minutes.  A similar thing happened with the utensils.  We needed utensils to eat our appetizers and when I approached the counter to get utensils was told that it would be brought to the table, which took another 5 minutes from when the appetizers arrived.

It's my favorite for the food and the service.\n\nLet me first tell you that you must order the Garlic Chicken. Don't even hesitate. Really. Order it! It's amazing. That garlic sauce is out of this world. You don't want to come here and order that when you're on a date though. Your breath will be so garlicky, you will be able to scare of vampires for hours. The garlic breath is worth it though. I have never been disappointed.\n\nWhat sets this place from other Mediterranean restaurants in the area is the location and service (and of course the garlic chicken).

He does EVERYTHING! from taking your order, to cooking your food and bringing you the bill, and evening cleaning and clearing your table. He is such a sweet and friendly man.

If you're in the area for just the day, definitely check this place out!", "I stumbled upon this place during a work visit to Monterey and happy I did. It's a small unassuming place from the street, but the once you walk in you can feel something special about this place. The owner is great,the atmosphere was very comfortable, and as I sat looking over the menu, it was great to see people coming in with big smiles on their faces while picking up their food. Half way through the menu and I was sold. They had a wonderful selection of vegan and vegetarian dishes for me to choose from. I ordered the large falafel combo plate, which was plenty of food for my large appetite. The tabouli was light with great flavor, not too bitter. The pita seemed freshly made and still hot when it got to the table. The hummus had the perfect creamy texture and smooth, light flavor. My favorite part was the falafels, they were perfect. Maybe the best I have had. They were a good size, crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, with the perfect texture and flavor. Next time I'm even close to Monterey I will be making a detour to this gem without hesitation.", "This place was AMAZING!!!

Getting the omakase is the way to go.  Keep in mind, however, that although the place make look traditional, their sushi is not.  You will find a quail egg atop your fluke sushi, tuna with tofu, salmon with tomato, creamy mushroom mackerel... and we can't forget about their foie gras sushi with a piece of daikon on top.  Their sushi is art.  As for the cooked foods, they have the best salmon teriyaki out of any Japanese place I've ever been to.  Who would have thought salmon teriyaki could be THAT good and that different, but it was.  Two gigantic pieces of salmon with some vegetables on the side makes a pretty large entree or a plate fit for sharing.  Service is great and although the place is a bit cramped, we always ask for and get the table in the narrow alleyway (after you pass the sushi bar) by the window because it's more private and intimate.", "Great sushi.\n\nI came here on a Sunday evening and it was pretty busy. We were seated at the counter without a reservation around 6pm. We ordered the omakase.\n\nTheir omakase system is pay-for-what-you-eat. The sushi chef just makes you a bunch of nigiri sushi until you tell him to stop. He serves them one at a time and based on some stuff he said, I believe he is planning a few pieces ahead at any given time.\n\nAfter 34 pieces for two people (17x2), the total came out to $340 with tip. This works out to approximately $8.5 a piece before tip. I felt this was very fair given the high quality of the meal.\n\nAlso, the sushi here is not of the traditional style. Many of the pieces come with contemporary changes like shiso sauces, a light searing, or random pastes. They were all well done - I normally react quite negatively to this.\n\nThe very last one, the \"tomato salmon\" was probably the least delicious one, despite their insistence that we try it. But 16 of 17 pieces is a great batting average.", "Ambience:3  Food:5  Service:4  Value:5  Return:5\n\nSushi of Gari is one of my favorite nooks at UES.\nUnassuming is its exterior. Minimal is its interior. Efficient is their staff. Phenomenal is their sushi.\n\nOn my visits, I always request to be seated at their cozy counter and go for their amazing omakase. There, I can see the intricacies of knife works and special care of ingredients from the chefs.\n\nExquisite is each plate. Starting the meal off with the subtlety of fresh and clean tasting sashimi, gradually building to more complex textures and riveting tastes with each piece of sushi thereafter.\n\nLoving every single seasonal piece I have had there while placing each delicately into my tummy.

If Flipper had fingers, he'd be dialing for take-away, or delivery since he doesn't have feet.  \n\nThis is one of my favorite sushi places in Manhattan because they adhere to the technique of no-frills sushi.  Even the spicy tuna roll elevates itself on a higher level than other SpT rolls; using tobasco sauce, mayo, and a touch of sesame oil so that the taste of tuna is still present.  The marinated chutoro and otoro nigiri that are slightly seared with the butane blow torch then topped with  modest and subtle garnishes (whipped tofu sauce, marinated onion and seaweed) has your mouth muttering, \"okairinasai\", in between each morsel of sushi heaven.  \n\nThe UES location is tiny.

I was also extremely weary of how my brother-in-law described the process as \"communal eating without utensils\".  I'm a fairly 'traditional' silverware guy.  \n\nHaving said that, my experience at Demera was superb.\n\nWe were a fairly large group and decided to order a meat messob for two (six choices) and a vegetarian messob for two (six choices).  \n\nI can't recall all of the dishes that we chose, but I can remember the Quosta (chopped spinach cooked with onions, garlic and ginger) & the Ye-siga wot (beef stewed with berbere sauce, flavored with onions, garlic and ginger root) standing out as my favorites.  \n\nDemera also offers a couple Ethiopian beers among twenty-or-so other imports and domestics.  The Bedele (Ethiopian) was a solid Pilsener.  \n\nThe service was good.  I don't believe my ice water ever passed below the half full threshold and our waitress was patient and polite.  \n\nIf you are like me and either have never been to Demera or haven't ever had Ethiopian food, I would recommend taking a minute to glance through Demera's website.  Their entire menu, with descripitions & their reasonable prices, is posted there (very helpful when writing a review).", "Never had Ethiopian food?  Well this has been one of my favorite Ethiopian restaurants in Chicago, so its a good place to start!\n\nDemera is a small place, located on the NE corner of Lawrence and Broadway. The entrees are best if you share them.  Come with a group of 3+ people and order a bunch of different entrees.  I highly recommend the cabbage ones, anything involving lentils, and anything involving lamb.  (note: I say \"anything\" simply because I have NO CLUE of the real names of the entres... but everything is tasty).\n\nHere's a primer on Ethiopian food:\n- there are no knives or forks.  You eat using \"injera\" which is a flat bread-like dough that tastes a bit sour. Everyone pinches off a bit of injera, and grabs the food from the center.\n-Expect a multitude of flavors ranging from spicy, sour sweet, and bbq.\n-no plates, my friends.  Use that injera with skill!\n-Try the Tuskan beer from Kenya - super crisp, light taste!\n\nEnjoy.", "This is the place for an excellent Ethiopian experience - make sure to set aside some time to enjoy.\n\nFor two, sitting at the low, colorful tables is an intimate dining setting. You can order a combination meal that will come as generous portions laid out between you on a table sized piece of injera, an bread similar in texture to a thick crepe, and tangy in taste. Every dish is colorful, full of flavor, and just plain delicious. The best part is that the plate, which you are dying to lick, is edible. Just remember that sharing is caring.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, you might try another place, as the place is often understaffed by western standards. Nevertheless, the staff are kind, generous to newcomers, and consistent. The buffet might be a good option for groups, but I prefer to order individual combination of Ethiopian goodness.\n\nThe decor is more natural than fancy, and you will often see Ethiopian families and cab drivers here. The only surprise when you get the check is the value.", "I wasn't expecting to like Ethiopian food. Spongy, sour bread is what I heard, and it scared me. I couldn't have been more wrong. We started with the chicken/veggie appetizer which reminded me of a samosa, and was extremely flavorful and tasty. The accompanying sauce was amazing - spicy, slightly hot and smoky. Once we tasted that, we knew we'd want to order the spicy dishes, so we split the 2 veggie 2 meat combo with spicy chicken, spicy beef, cabbage and spicy lentils. It was plenty of food for 2 of us. Loved every bite of it and never noticed anything about the bread really - it was secondary to all the great flavors of the food. I gave the Ethiopian beer a try - not so great, stick with the local microbrews on the menu.", "Demera is a great lunch spot for vegetarians. The lunch special is only $7.95 and includes your choice of FOUR dishes with injera bread. From what I remembered, there were more vegetarian than meat dishes. I always recommend the lentil porridge dishes like Ye-Misir Wot (\"spicy\" red lentils) and Kik Alitcha (yellow lentils).\n\nIf you're just not *that* hungry, there's an option to split the lunch entree with a friend at $4.50 extra!\n\nI prefer Demera's atmosphere over Lalibela's.

I felt sick to my stomach within 20 minutes of leaving the restaurant; I have never felt heartburn from pizza but I was up most of the night with my stomach and throat feeling like they were on fire and I still feel it as I type ~26 hours after leaving.\n\nI ate pizza with the same combination of ingredients in Rome two weeks ago and didn't feel anything like this.  The crust was light and airy.  They didn't overdo the ingredients and it wasn't rich at all.  I feel like Patricia's should know better than to serve something this sickening.  \n\nAnd fwiw, imho $12 per glass of Chianti is overpriced.  It's table wine...", "First and foremost, a big thank you to your servers who have made my parents' anniversary even more special. Your service and hospitality has touched our hearts, and made their 23rd anniversary unforgettable.\n\nSpaghetti Alla Frank Sinatra 3.5/5\nGood classic dish that has shrimp, clams, black olives, capers and fresh tomato. However, I think there are plenty of other star dishes you can get here.\n\nBlack Spaghetti 5/5\nMy favorite dish here which has rock shrimp, jalapeno, and spicy salami. The star was the al dente spaghetti.\n\nSeafood Risotto 5/5\nScallops were cooked perfectly and I loved the cuts of tender octopus. The risotto itself did not have too much parmesan cheese, and was not too salty. I would get this again!", "Can't get enough of this place, the food, atmosphere and service is excellent every single time I come here with my husband to eat.\n\nSome people rate a restaurant by the quantity it gives, Patricia gives a balanced serving with perfection because the quality out weights the over abundance that other local restaurant gives.\n\nMy husband and I came here recently for lunch, we shared some rigatoni with vodka sauce and it was simply perfectly al dente.\n\nWe both had the grilled chicken with broccoli rabe, it is that good, a dish that we will not share. The grilled chicken was seasoned just right, so thin that it melted it our mouth, simply delicious.\n\nCan't wait to go back again.", "This place rivals any and every pizza place I've been to in any of the boroughs, including Grimaldi's (gasp!).  The crust is, well, perfect.  That slight smokiness of the wood burning oven, that chewy on the inside/crispy on the outside balance...Patricia's nails it.  Quattro Formaggi with kalamata olives and fresh basil was a perfect way to start my day.  The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but you could easily eat alone or enjoy a few pies with most of your extended family.  Service was great and the pizza came out (and disappeared) quickly.

I managed to get into a spot after waiting for 10 minutes for a car to pull out. People (Chinese) in the car were tidying their faces after the meal. Baked chicken buns - soft dough and little chicken in fillings; shrimp dumplings too much stuffing and too huge so skin is thick; shau mau is fine but hugh size; 3 steamed chicken buns huge; tulip cake is tender and tasted tulips; bok choy has salted duck yolk and preserved duck yolk which are not to the liking of my non-oriental guests; scallop rice noodles all mushed up instead of one by one. I sensed that this place is not Hong Kong style. The price is not bad: $45+ tax and tips for 3 people with about 10 items and 1 vege at $9.99. My Caucasian friends always like some vege. When pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed royal Chinese guests were tidying up their face in their Mercedes. So be patient with parking. I guess the tradition lives on.

I really liked this place, it's small and intimate and the food was prepared delicately and with thought.  They are definitely going for the higher end route, with elegant decorations, no push carts, two pairs of chopsticks (one public, one for eating), some fancy items on the menu, and private dining rooms.  The food was not too salty or greasy, seasoned very well.  I did not have MSG headache afterwards either, meaning that they were very light on MSG.  \n\nI especially enjoyed the rice roll, because it was freshly steamed and pulled, making it a rarity in dim sum places nowadays.  Most restaurants used pre-made rice rolls and just reheat it in warmers nowadays, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that the rice roll were fresh to the order.  \n\nAs for the service, it was great, tea service was swift and waiters were quick to clear the table of empty dishes.  Overall, I will definitely be back.", "Comparable to the other \"high end\" dim sum spots (i.e. lunasia).  Overall thought the food was good & service was good, just a little pricey.\n\n+Quality of food - served hot and fresh.  They also do the giant har gow and siu mai and if you're feeling fancy, they have wagyu items, lobster, truffles and more.  Honestly I don't know how many people actually order that stuff though.  We ordered the wagyu steamed noodle just to see if there was anything special about it and it just tasted like dim sum lol\n\n+Service - our tea and water were served promptly.  The workers were wearing nice uniforms.  \n\n-Price - two people = $50+ at least (as opposed to other dim sum spots that can feed a family of 4!)\n\n-Parking - lot is pretty much garbage.

I am not familiar with dim sum but was lucky to be accompanied by someone who is.  Longo seems to be under the radar.  It's a more upscale dim sum place rather than the hole in the wall. There are no push carts here, all items are made fresh to order.  Just mark off your choices on the order sheet.\n\nThe decor is much more modern with chandeliers.  It was our first time here so we tried a little of everything.  My ultimate fave was the pork shu mai which were so juicy and huge.  We had the lobster/shrimp dumpling and it was also delicious.

Came with a big group for dinner, so we got seated in the private room. Inside were 2 tables of 10, a big screen tv, and a private bathroom. The table setting was very nice. They give you 2 sets of chopsticks. One to eat with and another to use to grab food off the platter. That way the food doesn't get contaminated. The food was tasty, but certain dishes were small.

Take a moment to talk to the staff if you are unsure about what wine to order. They know their stuff and will never steer you wrong. Chef does an amazing job with the seasonal menu. I've been through at least 3 menu changes and everything I've ordered is delicious. One staple that remains on the menu is their burger. Hands down, it's the best burger in Napa.

Favs ranked in order of yum....\n1- SWEET CORN AGNOLOTTI / BLUE CRAB SAUCE CARDINAL\n2- FIA ITALIAN CHOPPED SALAD / PERSONALLY DRESSED / TRUFFLE VINAIGRETTE\n3- SPICY CHILI TUNA / CRISPY ARANCINI\n4- HANDMADE CAVATELLI / PARMESAN / BROWN BUTTER / FRESHLY SHAVED BLACK TRUFFLE (this is their signature pasta dish btw)\n5- BURRATA / CHARRED CORN / FARMER'S MARKET PEACHES / POLENTA GAUFRETTE\n\nEverything was brought out properly coursed and we enjoyed every dish. Flavors were unique and portions were solid. We capped the night with a pumpkin creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and hung out a bit more enjoying the ambiance. Servers were gracious and did not make us feel pressure to get up or bring us the check in a hurry. Will be back for a date night.", "Finally an extraordinary restaurant in Santa Monica. This restaurant has all the elements necessary for a 5 star restaurant: food, ambiance, show, and service.\n\nWent here on a double date and it was the perfect place for it. Most items are to be shared which allowed us to experience all that Fia's spectacular menu is. I'll rank the items for you, best to least of the best (spoiler: no negative review). Spicy tuna arancini, corn, spicy salmon cones, wake me up martini, and lasagna. The spicy tuna was seriously unlike anything I've ever eaten and I can promise you it's in the top 3. All the food and drinks were perfect in taste and presentation. The menu is a playful take on your favorite classics & executed flawlessly.\n\nOnly complaint was that after our shared plates were served, we waited about 25 minutes for our entrees. Other than that, I'm so excited to come again to indulge.", "Was lucky enough to snag a reservation here on Thanksgiving for the prix fixe. It was $95 per person for a huuge feast that could easily serve two people. Needless to say, we had a lot of takeout boxes.\n\nI loved the organic, rustic feel of the space, especially that tree growing from the outdoor patio by the bar! Very cozy yet chic vibes.\n\nAll the dishes were extremely hearty and comforting. The starters and side dishes were served family style, which was a nice touch. Overall, very close to what you might imagine a classic American Thanksgiving meal might be.\n\nThere were two choices for each course, and we all tried at least one of each. For starters, they had a butternut squash soup and salad with pomegranate seeds. The main course was either the turkey or prime rib. They were out of the arctic char by the time of our dinner.\n\nThe side dishes were very generously portioned and consisted of all the classics: pecan yams, green beans, brussels sprouts, roasted potatoes, sage stuffing, and cauliflower gratin. The toasted pecans on the yams were a really nice touch and helped to balance out the sweetness. The roasted potatoes were also amazingly crispy and fresh!\n\nFor dinner, we had pumpkin pie and apple pie. It was a Happy Thanksgiving indeed!", "We had a fantastic dinner at Fia on Saturday to celebrate my mom's 65th birthday. It is the perfect spot for a special occasion meal! Definitely on the pricier side, especially if you bring your own alcohol. $45 per bottle corkage fee -- yikes!!\n\nThe ambiance is just lovely on their covered patio with trees and string lights all around. The service was impeccable. Everyone who serviced our table from pouring our water, to taking our order, to bringing our food, was quick, attentive, and professional. I even commented that I loved the music playlist, and our waiter brought the Manager of Operations to our table so that I could meet him and compliment him in person! The music, for reference, was modern alternative electronic, which everyone at the table including my mom enjoyed.\n\nMUST-ORDER items:\n* Rock shrimp cakes\n* Cavatelli with fresh shaved truffle\n* Brussel sprouts\n* Braised short rib\n* Lemon mousse\n* Ricotta bombolino\n\nI would definitely recommend Fia to anyone looking for a special dining experience!", "This place has an amazing ambiance. The drinks were great, too. We weren't blown away by the food - rather, we found the flavors to be too bold. We shared the salmon tartare cones, black garlic brussel sprouts, corn, cacio e Pepe risotto, and shrimp tikka masala. We found all of the flavors to mask the main ingredient of each dish and overpower what should shine through.\n\nOur favorite was the cacio e pepe risotto and our least favorite was the corn. It was far too sweet.

In addition to the appetizing house signature, other favorites feature bright salads such as escarole with Gaeta olives, capers and gorgonzola; Neapolitan-style pizza; or the day\u2019s special baked pasta.", "yelp_reviews": ["Wood-burning ovens are the best: you get nice high temperatures that mean a charred pizza that's crisp on the bottom but leaves a nice chewy crust with plenty of air bubbles.  \n\nSan Matteo might be a tiny restaurant but their flavors are big and bold! Cemented into the wall behind a tile mosaic is the wood-burning pizza oven that pumps out the delicious creations like a heart with tomato sauce for blood.  \n\nWhen you're here, you must try a panuozzo which is an adorable name for a sandwich made from the same pizza dough as their pizzas. Cut open and stuffed with a variety of fillings, the panuozzo gives you a hearty sized meal with a higher topping to crust ratio than your traditional pizza.  My personal favorite is the Di Bartolomei which has roast pork, mozzarella, and arugula.  It's juicy, crunchy, chewy and soft all at the same time.  They also have generously sized salads, perfectly made pizzas, and interesting appetizers.  \n\nThe restaurant is decorated with photos and soccer paraphernalia from the Salerno region as well as many many bottles of wine.  It feels like a piece of Italy in the middle of the Manhattan.  We like to come here and carbo-load after a grueling day of walking around the nearby museums.  Ok ok, the museums are just an excuse to come eat yummy food!", "Finally was able to scratch this particular notch on my list of reviews. San Matteo is located on the Upper East Side, and the patrons reflects the local community. Despite its rather small and cramped space, the staff is more than gracious and welcoming and they really go the distance in making every patron feel like a VIP.\n\nSan Matteo specializes in whole baked pizza pies, calzones and panuozzo. A panuozzo is basically a hybrid between a pizza and an calzone. The dough is hollowed out and stuffed.\n\nStill though, the pizza here is too good to not order so I went with the Paesana Pie. Its topped with fresh tomato sauce, bufalo mozzarella, eggplant and basil. The combination of these classic Italian staple elements really make such a mouthwatering pie. Quick tip.........drizzle just a little bit of extra olive oil on The Paesana. It adds even more flavor.\n\nAnd for dessert I went classic again and had the Tiramisu.", "San Matteo is a cozy little space that can't be classified as a pizzeria. It's so much more! A great place to grab some wine, great cheese platters, amazing Neapolitan style pizza and the always impressive panuozzi.\n\n I have been once with my father for lunch and another time with two other couples on the way to Yankee stadium for a concert. The space is tight and seating is limited but its well worth it. They have a great wine list and an endless amount of appetizers consisting of imported salumi and cheeses. Everything is of great quality and prepared with care and attention. The panuozzi I think it my favorite dish there. It's almost like a panini and calzone had a miraculous love child.\n\n The staff is very attentive and accommodating, always offering specialty pizzas and panuozzi. I can't wait to be back", "Quick lunch here and only had the pizza, but was it ever good. Very small place (~8 tables and a bar with some stools, wood-burning oven in the back) with friendly, charming waiter and pizzaiolo.\n\nI ordered the \"Diavola\" -- tomato, basil, homemade mozzarella, spicy soppressata, olive oil and Parmigiano Reggiano ($14). It arrived pretty quickly on a metal plate, around 12\" in diameter and cut into four slices.\n\nAs has been noted, the crust is terrific -- chewy, crisp, thin, lightly charred, flavorful and neither dry nor heavy. Toppings were also great -- bright-tasting sauce, fresh mozzarella forming round, snow-white pools hot from the oven, soppressata scattered in firm, spicy matchsticks, and a sprinkling of hot pickled pepper rounds for added kick. Well balanced, not overloaded... a beautiful pie. Since they're thin they cool pretty quickly, with some inevitable center droop, but post-cooling sogginess was not excessive. Still, these pizzas would seem to be at their best fresh from the oven and probably wouldn't travel well with delivery.\n\nThe next table over ordered a panuozzo which looked pretty darn delicious. Great and very welcome addition to the neighborhood -- they really know what they're doing. I'll definitely be back.", "I was on the fence of giving either 4 or 5 stars to this place and went with 4 because of price. That being said, there are a bunch of rip off restaurants on the UES and I'd much prefer to spend my money here.\n\nWhile eating dinner in cramped quarters, it really felt like we could have been in Italy. The guys behind the bar, decorated with Italian tiles, sausages and a giant nutella jar, were all speaking Italian and drinking pellogrino while making espresso and baking pizzas in a lovely wood fired oven.\n\nThe average pizza price is $15 or so. They also had antipasti and other hot appetizers which were also in this price range. We had the burrata, which I didn't like as much as I thought I would. The pizza and the gnocchi were delicious and tasted authentic (though I've never been to napoli or salerno). The lattes were excellent. We also got the our italian \"cheesecake\" which tasted a little too fruit rind-y at first.\n\nMy hubby got a glass of wine that was $7. Overall, dinner including tax, tip, etc. came out to $40 a per person which is a little steep for a quick weekday dinner, but I liked the ambiance and the food was good.

We sat overlooking the pool and golf course, with a big outdoor heater warming our backs, with just the sounds of a few other guests and the view of the ocean in the distance to distract us.\n\nThe inside looked more formal, but the outdoor setting was perfect for a mid-day break.  \n\nThe service was top-notch, starting with the delicious bread and butter that I could not get enough of - both the sourdough and multi-grain were great.\n\nI had the chicken under a brick, which I would highly recommend.  The chicken is incredibly juicy, with just the right crispness to the skin, served with wilted greens.   The others in my party loved their meals, too.\n\nWe didn't order dessert, but lingered over some of their delicious coffee, and they brought us some white chocolate coconut truffles with our bill.\n\nIf you are in the area, be sure to stop by - and leave a little time to explore the inside of the Lodge and the grounds afterwards - lovely!", "The restaurant continues the theme of faux Greene and Greene/craftsman design--very expensive looking (and was to build), but ultimately, leaves you wishing to revist the Gamble House--or a really inspired restaurant.\n\nThe kitchen seems to be trying, and while the menu does seem to be trying to get seasonal ingredients, too many items on the menu simply don't succeed. (For example, a 'minestra' of fresh spring vegtables (spring onions, fava beans, peas, etc. lacked any depth in a watery broth;   a trio of puddings comprised a bland starchy lavender-flavored white pudding, a gritty hazelnut/chocolate, but a butterscotch had some depth of flavor.)\n\nThe wine list is nearly all California. There is a range of wines by the glass and a good selection  of moderately price offerings as well as the expected high priced cult wines (for the credulous on expense accounts).\n\nService can be obsequious to pushy for the higher-priced items; otherwise it can be efficient though lackluster. Even on a mid-week night, the wait between courses was excessive.\n\nFree parking is easily available in the large lot.\n\nOddly, it was impossible to reach anyone by phone to make a dinner reservation (required for lunch and probably weekends).

The view from the craftsman-style patio is very nice, the interior however feels very 1980-dated in a plush and flowery-posh way. It clearly appeals to an older and more conservative crowd.\n\nHad the food been any good, we would not have minded. Our lunch was however one of the most underwhelming experiences in a long time. Yes, a grand old hotel like the Lodge at Torrey Pines does set some expectations.\n\nMy wife's duck breast, which we ordered medium-rare, arrived well-done, dried-out and flavor-less. I tried the swordfish and again was presented with a dry, rather bland piece of fish, which was drowned in crushed coriander. The absolute low-point however was our daughter's \"chicken under a brick\".

Our entr\u00e9es: perfectly cooked local swordfish with fava beans and tasty sauce and seared scallops crispy on the outside, tender on the inside with lovely arugula and avocado. There was a complimentary amuse bouche and side of sweet roasted carrots. The second night we had a very nice lobster and tangerine appetizer, then outstanding salmon and fresh peas and roast pork and spinach, with complimentary amuse bouche and side of kohlrabi--something I don't think of being 'gourmet' but was given gourmet preparation in a soy/ginger sauce.

My husband said he can probably go up to 3 or 4. It's the classic \"ma la\" numbing spice of Sichuan peppercorns. The fish dish was cooked with a light brown sauce. The fish was silky as was the tofu. The reason for only 4 stars is because the portions are on the small side compared to restaurants in Chinatown or Flushing. Also service could be improved. There was only one waitress (the owner?) when we went and service was quite sporadic. I hope they stay around because there are very few authentic Chinese restaurants in this area.

I think I paid around $25 which I thought was not worth for the amount of food I was getting, but at the end I had a lot of food left.

Or well, atleast made them a tad tighter.  Nestled in a sea of various cuisine store-fronts, Bistro Campagne is a tiny slice of frenchie heaven.  Its menu is constantly changing to keep up to date with the season and although there have been times when I was forced to order something entirely different than what I had been craving for the week prior to my visit- I always end up with a new obsession.  Their salads are killer- salade de betteraves which literally looks like art on the plate, mingles succulent roasted beets and bitterly tangy arugula- salade maraichere au chevre chaud caters to those that adore goat cheese perfection.  But its real specialty lies in the true creative of french classics.  Onion soup dances in your mouth and the tarte aux champignons combines earthiness with the subtle sweetness that only a handful of chefs can get out of a mushroom.  I typically pair my dinner with a bottle of bubbly but that doesnt mean I havent noticed its rather selective wine list.  Ranging from savory Bordeaux's to the most coveted Sauternes- Bistro Campagne has a little grape juice for every palate...and bank account.", "Rich, buttery pesto covered escargot paired with a perfectly crispy baguette and delicious Bordeaux wine... this has to be heaven! \u2063\n\u2063\nThis quaint French bistro was everything we dreamed of and more!

Indoors - the restaurant is seperated into several different rooms with only a few tables per room, and you feel like you're at a friends house for a dinner party.  The restaurant looks just like a small craftsman style house from the inside.  The outside dining is very limited, but behind a wall in a small garden area with several large shade trees.  \n\nThe food is good, but not amazing.  I would score the food a \"3\" and the ambiance a \"5\", so that's how I came up with 4 for an overall score.  The mac'n'cheese is really good, but if I recall correctly the price was $14 bucks for mac'n'cheese.  The french onion soup I would also highly recommend, it would have scored a 5 for sure!\n\nFinal words of advice - great date spot for a \"get to know you\" date...", "Say what you will about the food here, but i will cut you if you try to diss their pain perdu. IT. IS. NEXT. LEVEL. Oh, you think bread pudding isn't your thing? THINK AGAIN. I used to think bread pudding was soggy and uninteresting but I am a changed woman now. That's right, this bread pudding was literally life changing. The figs, brown butter soaked brioche cubes, the caramel, the rich vanilla bean ice cream... It is just perfect. If you get nothing else, get this. It is worth stopping by just for dessert.\n\nAlso every Tuesday they have unlimited mussels and frites and i love it, I eat two bowls.", "to be fair, probably a 3.5 overall rating.\n\ndid the prixe fix menu, on bastille day so they were pretty crowded.\n\nas my wife put it, they should have taken some of the salt out of the house salad and put it in the potato leak soup, neither of which was very impressive. there were sections of the onion strudel where the philo dough was thick and seemed raw.\n\ncome the entrees:\n\nthe steak frites was awesome!\n\nchicken over mushrooms was average. i don't want to be a typical american and say i wish it had more sauce, but it was chicken with little to know spices on top of some mushrooms in a very limited amount of sauce. i just don't usually enjoy chicken where there is no spice\n\nthen the desserts, had two:\n\nfig one not all that\n\nanother one that does not appear to be on their regular menu was house made caramel, house made chocolate ice cream and a tasty pastry.\n\nall in all probably would not go back until we go to some other french places.\n\nby the way, we just got back from paris, and this place was definitely authentic in terms of taking their time in between dishes, we were probably there 2.5 hrs.", "What a wonderful experience!  First, let me say Thank You to the staff at Bistro Campagne for treating my 3 year old as a guest and not as an annoyance!  It is very rare to have a white tablecloth restaurant who treats children so well!\nSecond, from the moment we walked in to the time we left, the servers, bussers, hosts were all gracious & welcoming.  Our server, in particular, not only knew the menu & wine list well she was able to talk to all of us about our different needs as well as kept our daughter feeling like she was at the table.\nThird, the food was wonderful.  I had the duck and my husband had the steak.  Both were prepared perfectly.  The duck was moist and fell off the bone.  I had the butternut squash with the brown butter, which was excellent.  \nFinally, we never mentioned it was our anniversary, but our server must have overheard us.  After we ordered dessert they brough out candles on each of our dessert plates as a way to help us celebrate.  What a great touch to make our experience even better!  \nOverall a great meal & service!  Will definitely go back and will definitely recommend to others!", "Aweeee I loved this experience!! So beautiful so nice!! Went here awhile back and sat in the outside garden area with gorgeous twinkle lights.

It checks off all of the boxes for a modern hot spot with its industrial-chic design, hipster-packed bar and buzz-worthy cooking. Bidwell takes the farm-to-table trend and tops it\u2014quite literally\u2014since the rooftop garden supplies much of the produce.\nSalads are a great way to sample the goods of this kitchen. Start with the Cobb, combining crisp Romaine, cherry tomatoes, blue cheese, and slices of perfect skirt steak. The popular Irish-American onion soup pairs well with a selection of sausages, while grilled chicken sandwich is a lunchtime thrill. Butterscotch pudding with chocolate shavings is an absolute sweet treat.", "yelp_reviews": ["Interesting food with a local bent, Bidwell is a restaurant well worth heading over to Union Market to try. One of the unique features at Bidwell is that many of the herbs and vegetables used in its dishes are grown on-site in the hydroponic roof garden.\n\nThe food itself is pleasant. The bean dip starter is topped with cheese and served with grilled pita, offering textural contrast and a slightly spiced flavor. The lobster quesadilla was a hit at my table. It's served in a sushi-roll like presentation which is a strong choice that allows patrons to taste the lobster and accompanying sauces without any of the elements overwhelming each other.\n\nAs for the entrees, the salmon was excellent, though my sole criticism would be that I could have easily eaten twice, if not three times as much of the grilled cauliflower that accompanied the dish. The fresh herbs on top lent the dish a wonderful freshness. The short ribs were strong in taste and soft in texture and paired well with the mashed potatoes that accompanied them.\n\nThe small chocolate chip cookies that ended our meal were a nice way to finish off this delicious experience. Bidwell is a nice restaurant that I'll be looking for an excuse to come back to in the future.", "Visiting from Seattle and had the pleasure to grab lunch there this afternoon, the staff could not have been more cordial and warm but I get a bit peeved when people rate restaurants because of a one off experience with a staff member, this is about the food.\n\nThe short rib sandwich with blue cheese was one of the best sandwiches I have eaten. It has greens on it as well that seem to have been tossed in a vinaigrette that gives it nice bite. The chew of the roll is also appropriate and absorbs the juice from the tender meat. I had it with the salad which was also great, probably because the lettuce is grown on the roof of the market! A friend had the strawberry salad with chicken that he said was also very good.\n\nIt was 11:30am so we didn't partake in any cocktails. But the bar prep was underway and by the freshness of their ingredients (all juices fresh squeezed and herbs from the rooftop garden) and liquor selection, to include many good bottles of scotch, I have no doubt their cocktails would be delicious as well. Must try if you are in the area.", "Had a great experience here having brunch with bottomless mimosas. They allow you to enjoy this privilege for 2 hours which enabled us to drink a LOT, thereby making it well worth the $$. We sat up at the kitchen bar and watched the cooks do their thing and they did it efficiently and expertly. I particularly enjoyed watching them maneuver their kind of sous vide poached egg set up, producing a perfect egg every time. The service was fine, the food was good and the location and atmosphere desirable. It's not going to blow your mind but it's a solid brunch spot and it's hard to beat bottomless mimosas!", "Just picked up a Casears salad from Bidwell. When I open the box I couldn't believe what i saw they literally put the entire salad out of the grocery bag . Its not cut and so dry. Also I asked for chicken on the side. The chicken is somehow burnt, dry and tasteless.    The service was horrible, the person was just an order taker ( I can get that at MCDonald) union Market was busy and there were a lot of people at the other Businesses. There was-not a single person / customer at Bidwell. There were 2 other employees on the bar eating their food. All three employees seems to be engaged in their own little world completely clueless I was standing there for 5 minutes while the person who took my order is on the phone. Will never go back there, I will let all my friends, family, colleagues and neighbors know not to ever go this place.", "I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and experience at Bidwell! I frequent Union Market (go basically every weekend), and I've always passed on trying out Bidwell.\n\nDecided that a sit down lunch would be nice, so my friends and I opted for lunch at Bidwell's. We also were craving the BBQ they were firing up outside.\n\nMy friend and I split the BBQ chicken special and each got a soup. My friend's chilled tomato soup as delicious and made fresh from tomatoes that they grow on their rooftop soil-less garden. What a novel concept! We toured the garden after the meal and it was very cool. I'm all about farm to table and sustainable agriculture, so I ate the entire experience up!\n\nThe BBQ chicken was fantastic. The potato salad was very tasty and the chicken was fired up to a crisp.\n\nThe asparagus pistachio soup and chocolate brownie dessert we got were only okay.\n\nI'll be back soon to try their other offerings! Service was really nice as well.", "At the newly renovated Union Market, Bidwell provides an additional delicious eating choice.  The happy hour has a great selection of appetizers and drinks. The friendly staff is an added bonus while enjoying a great meal. The Bidwell burger is a great tasting choice. A patty melt style burger with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese on rye is a unique and tasty sandwich.  Their house made thousand island dressing is the bomb.  \nWhen you sit at the bar ask for Cassie, fun smart and an attentive bartender. For a relaxed and great meal this is the place.", "Twas quite bad.  Onion soup tasted burnt and as if it had fish in it.   Been dip was fine and a beer was a beer.

Seats are close together, but the space is very inviting even as the volume of chatter increases. Chef Aaron Silverman\u2019s cooking focuses on modern, seasonal fare, starring approachable ingredients that merely add to their signature affable yet fanciful style.

Thoughtfully and beautifully decorated. Chicken sandwich, donut, and ricotta toast are must-haves.\n\nI probably go to Little Pearl at least once a week whether it's to have a glass of wine, get coffee and do some work, or have lunch with friends. The division of spaces -- several tables outside, a smaller quiet room inside, and another light-filled more social indoor space-- help make this a great neighborhood spot for every occasion and mood. Everything from the copper silverware to the little flowers placed on their toast is so well thought out and deliberate. There's also heat lamps in the winter!\n\nThe spicy fried chicken sandwich ($13) and the homemade ricotta and sweet potato toast ($9) are hands down my personal favorites. The potato donut also makes for a nice treat if you're craving something that isn't overly sweet. The coffee is fairly average and not the shining star of the menu.", "I love Aaron Silverman's family of restaurants--Roses Luxury, Pineapple and Pearls, and the expansion of Little Pearl is no exception in the old carriage house on Penn Ave SE.\n\nFirst off, the space is very modern and sleek (more common in DC these days), though I do wish they preserved more of the antiquity of the building.  You order up front, and seating is in the back--wondering if they will open up the second floor for more seating.  On a nice day, about twenty places to sit outdoors.  \n\nI ordered a coconut nutmeg latte and the fried spicy chicken which is definitely on the hotter end of spicy!  Be aware of that.  Other items that piqued my interest was the Japanese friend chicken and the brisket sandwich.  \n\nAll in all, food and coffee good!  Wish they honored more of the character of the carriage house in its design.

And while everything we tried was absolutely delicious, I was super impressed with how amazing their service was. They were running a bit late, so we were seated 45 mins after our reservation, but we honestly didn't mind waiting. They also were really good about checking in with us and even got us a round of drinks, which was lovely. I had a cocktail with rosemary and gin and it was super tasty. They have a small but high quality wine selection as well.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see that the portions were larger than other tasting menus I've tried; I left the meal incredibly stuffed and with some leftovers. My favorites were the angel eggs, corn and shrimp tacos, their take on grilled cheese + tomato soup, and the gooey sea salt chocolate chip cookies they gave us to close out the night.\n\nAll in all, the dining experience was amazing, with delicious food and fantastic service. I'll definitely be back and have recommended this place to everyone I know in the area - it's one of my new favorite restaurants in DC!", "Went for dinner to check out the new prix fixe menu. Arrived right at 5:30 without reservations, was a little disappointed to be seated in the enclosed outdoor patio despite the restaurant being empty (it was full by the time we left though).\n\nThe earlier small plates in the meal were cute and tasty, although a bit absurd (a single tater tot with a dot of sauce on top, a deviled egg with the white meringued).\n\nHowever, I've never felt embarrassed and insulted by an entree before, but the \"homage to the In-n-Out animal style double-double\" was not quite what I had in mind for dinner - if I wanted to share a sloppy fast food hamburger we could've found that elsewhere with a slightly smaller price tag.\n\nThankfully the staff didn't take themselves too seriously, and our server's selections for the wine pairings were great (although a wine pairing with fast food felt somewhat ridiculous), but we left at the end of the night feeling like the chef had taken advantage of the format to serve a meal which would have been unacceptable otherwise.", "Took my husband here for his bday celebration! Paid $200 for a 5 course tasting menu. We got there early and we were seated right away. My husband wanted his usual Moscow mule.  Well they have no soda and no full bar. That did not start off well.

The wait time between portions is intentional so as to enjoy the experience (it was very windy, cold and we were hungry(don't come here if your hungry unless you want to add caviar on for an extra $90 or 4 oysters for $90 lol)\n\nLook the food was good the service was good. This place is way over priced. In the end I spent over $300 to leave hungry and disappointed.\n\nWe got home and my husband went straight for the fridge after spending all that $$$ Learned my lesson.

The pizzas are on the small side but can be a meal by themselves for one or shared with another dish for two which is what we did. I recommend the pesto. We also got an order of the beef carpaccio which my dinning partner thought was a little heavy handed on the mustard (as raw beef isn't exactly my thing, I didn't eat much of it).

It's a great, deep space was previously occupied by the the \"all the pasta you can eat\" Il Radicchio and, ironically, given that the name Sonoma evokes California, the menu here still leans heavily towards Italian.  I have never been disappointed with the pasta, and while they do also serve pizzas, small plates and entrees, I prefer to sit at the long bar and enjoy one of the over 40 wines by the glass served from their nitrogen wine dispenser.

I'd recommend checking it out even if you are drinking/dining downstairs.  It's a neat space and very inviting.\n\nThe only slight negative would be the seating options downstairs.  I've been here for happy hours and work events in the past, and it is always packed.  Going in for the lunch hour is a little different, as the multitude of bar seats are empty and there are only tables for large groups, and then a few smaller ones way in the back by the kitchen.

I didn't care for the goat cheese stuffed tomatoes, but everything else was delicious. My favorite risotto fritters were the quinoa ones, which seemed to be a favorite of everyone.\n\nSonoma is the perfect spot for a casual drink at the bar or a private event.

I've ordered the dry aged burger served on a brioche several times. It has always been scrumptious. It has been consistently the best burger I have had all summer. It was cooked the right amount and delivered great flavor particularly with the Fontina cheese on top.\n\nI've also had their pizza which is also on the mark.\n\nThe interior space is open and spacious, but it can be very loud inside when it is busy and it appears to be frequently busy. My parents stopped in for a drink once and ended up with free booze because their order got lost along the way, due to it being so busy.\n\nI can't really comment on the wines and drinks as I didn't drink any liquor.", "We came here on a Saturday night around 9 for after dinner drinks and expected to find the bar packed but were happy to find that it had just cleared out.

Last, the margaritas are potent and delicious...no skimping on the tequila.\n\nNevertheless, I have to subtract a star. Reason #1 is because the portion were SO small: I needed to order two entrees to feel even partly full. Reason #2 is that the food and drinks were too pricey given the portion size. Reason #3 is that although my server was very friendly and responsive, another employee gave me attitude when I asked if the front door could be shut--temps were in the 50s and I was being blasted with cold air.\n\nWould I return? Probably; I will likely dream about those tamales. However, maybe they can be accompanied by some rice and beans?", "Great place great food overall amazing experience!

The mole took me back to a nostalgic moment in my young life while in Mexico. It's almost as good or better than your grandmothers cooking!!\n\nThe margaritas were fuego (fire in English) lol it's meant in a good way. The jalape\u00f1o infused tequila made it quite interesting cocktail. The refreshing tastes of tamarind with the sweet spice of jalape\u00f1o infused tequila was just refreshing. It awakes your palate and enhances your sense of smell. The watermelon was my other margarita and it was just right the cooling of the watermelon made for a great drink.\n\nThe service was excellent as well a very attentitive staff who made sure the margaritas never got low and that every little detail was not expensed.\n\nIf you're looking for an above average place that gives you a nostalgic feel of home cooked food with just a taste...

I ordered chicken enchiladas (I know - kinda boring) but I gotta say, the sauce was extremely flavorful and one of the tastiest enchiladas I've ever had.  My wife got the carne asada tacos and those alone would make me want to come back.  Also had a margarita and it was made just right.

The prices are slightly better here and you also have a lot of options.\n\nYou have plenty of tequila choices here, as well! I really enjoyed my meal here, which consisted of:\n\n-- Tacos de Tinga de Pollo ($12): added to a spice level that was already burning off my mouth, but I did that by choice\n\n-- Flan ($7?): this was delicious; very rich and a perfect little end to the meal\n\n-- Toronja Habanero ($12): the death cocktail, which was so good but also so, so bad for my mouth.

They were nice in flavor but not as strong. I would want a Mexican place to make stronger margaritas at least. Anyway, we got seated. Ordered guacamole, vegetarian quesadillas and corn for the appetizers. Everything was just ok. Quesadillas were too crispy and dry. Guacamole felt like it was mass produced and just brought to the table within 2 min of ordering. Corn was too wet, had some kind of liquid at the bottom. Waiter was kinda pushy and just kept forcing us to order. I know they were busy but you can't keep asking for the order every 5 min. Anyway, for entrees we ordered enchiladas verdes and rojas. I personally thought verdes was better but my husband liked rojas more. For dessert we got tres leches, it was ok just a little dry.

You're first greeted by the hostess, where she then reveals the entrance to the restaurant by swinging open the painting.\n\nWe were greeted by the friendly team, and because it is a counter space, you get to see the team prepare each dish and interact with them. We were treated with the amuse bouches, followed by the six-service menu. The menu changes every month and serves seasonal ingredients, so it is interesting to see how ingredients are used to craft the meal! Every bite was a pleasant surprise and left us wanting more.\n\nAside from the food, the ambiance is also truly worth noting. The music, the lights, the air of friendliness makes you forget the fact that this is one of the busiest and most energetic cities in the world.

We were greeted with warm smiles by our waiter and the sommelier before starting the great experience of enjoy the prefix menu. The chef made a point to chat and laugh with us while explaining the process of creating the dishes (especially the halibut, which was my favorite).

You can sit at the bar and watch the chefs in action, or there is a table available for parties of 4-6. The atmosphere is upscale. The service was immediately friendly and welcoming. As the food and wine is served, the chef serving it, explains the creation and why the wine was chosen to pair with the food. The presentation of the food was fabulous, the taste was a memorable experience in that the various textures and flavors just simply blow your mind.

Was pleasantly surprised to find they had finally gotten their liquor license, so we had the wine pairings with the 5 course meal. A stand out was the frois gras which we ordered separately from the tasting course... I have actually never tasted something so exquisite. For me, Frevo was an artistic experience where my palate was shown something truly unique. Definitely one of the most satisfying dining experiences I have had in NYC. You get what you pay for though, as prices for two can quickly exceed $600 total. Per se prices. Hopefully though they soon become Michelin star rated!\n\nPS, the restaurant is hidden behind an art gallery which might sound pretentious, but I assure you it is not. Hard to achieve exclusivity without pretentiousness but the owners have achieved it both in the restaurant concept as well as in the service.

However, it's not only a place to echo your taste of art but also to amuse your palate. Frevo serves a prix fixe 5-course tasting menu of French technique. Each of the dishes is well designed and prepared. I particularly love the crab cold dish and the duck. It is also worthy mentioning that they serve a mind-blowing non-alcohol pairing currently - just imagine pairing the halibut with a lovely cup of seaweed tea! Yesterday, a restaurant called vespertine in LA which is run by some artists was granted two Michelin stars.

Coalfire will add garlic to any pizza free - take advantage of this because who doesn't need more garlic?\n\nWe've decided the perfect thing to do is get one 'NDuja & build one pizza  with our own toppings. They recommend not getting more than 2-3 toppings because their Neapolitan crust is thin.  They also have some really interesting beer selections and service has always been spectacular.\n\nThe oven is really hot and the restaurant can get toasty inside, even on a cold Chicago winter night.

It lived up to most of the hype.  First off, people should know this is not a traditional pizza joint.  Its not the typical thin-crust or stuffed pizza fare.  I guess it based on the style of pizza from Naples...no not the wealthy old person paradise in FLA...the one in Italy.  Its different and really good.  Its not as saucy and the toppings really make the pizza.  We had the Margharita, which was very good.  The house salad was also just fine.  Looking around, people had a lot of interesting looking pizzas.\n\nThe service was ok.  The food came out in normal time.  The wait staff was not overly attentive.  The space it is in is very nice and fits well with the neighborhood.\n\nIts BYOB...which is sweet.  They dont even charge a corkage fee, however you have to open your own bottle, which is fine by me.\n\nAll-in-All, pretty solid.  The pizza is great, and its BYOB.  The style of pizza isnt one you could eat every night.  I doubt this would be your go-to pizza place.

K and I have been reminiscing about our pizza journey in NYC, comparing Grimaldi's to John's on Bleecker to Lombari's. Coalfire just about matched up to our NYC faves.\n\nK and I stopped in today for lunch. Sure, we could have just ordered ONE pizza, but what fun is that? We opted for the Margherita and the Fiorentino. Both were brought to the table in record time, leaving me to wonder: just how HOT are those coals? The Margherita was solid, complete with nice, tangy tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella (although I could have use a touch more cheese and a dab more sauce on this pie). The Fiorentino, covered with spicy salami and red peppers, was also a winner. Both crusts were the right balance of crispy, chewy, and \"coal fired-y\" without being doughy.\n\nBonus for me: this place serves Menabrea! I've only seen it at two other pizza spots in the city, so that was certainly a treat. Service was casual, without making us feel rushed. And we shouldn't have felt rushed - the place was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon.\n\nCan't wait to get back and try their other pies!", "Coalfire was our last stop while on the Chicago Pizza Tour, and it was one of my favorites!  Foodies will love this place.\n\nThere's a huge difference between coal-fired pizza and your typical oven baked pizza.  Coalfired gives thin crust a crispy, crunchy, airy crust handle, with bits of char on each bite.  The char gives the pizza an extra layer of flavor that other pizza doesn't have.  \n\nI'm sort of in love with the dollops of ricotta cheese that is squeezed onto each slice.  I spread that dollop over my entire slice so I get a taste of it in each bite.  The crust is super thin, and so you don't feel like you're eating a ton.  It helps if you fold the slice in half (like NY pizza) so that it doesn't flop over and you lose all of your ricotta!\n\nWe had the white pizza and the pepperoni.  Both were equally delicious.  I prefer the white.  Garlic, cheese, olive oil and fresh basil pair so well together - no red sauce is needed.  I was stuffed to the gills, but wanted so badly to cram more slices into my mouth!  \n\nI so wish they were located in the suburbs so that I could eat more of this heavenly grub.

They guy that runs the place is always super pleasant when I pick up my pie. He's pretty laid back and friendly, most  importantly he just seems like a cool dude (the convo isn't forced).

They take advantage of the local bounty, and I'm happy to partake. During the summer, we had a killer pizza with roasted tomatoes and smoked mozzarella. For the early spring, it was provolone and shaved asparagus. I honed right in on the spaghetti with fava beans because they are quintessentially spring as well. It was our favorite dish of the whole trip! During our first visit, we were given some comped wine and desserts due to a long wait for food, and they were both excellent.

Always busy, even turned away a couple times with no reservation - and now I understand, for good reason, this place rocks!\n\nThe pizza is amazing, procuito/raddicio pizza was incredible, right out of the wood fire oven, thin crisy but tender crust, and savory combo of topping and tart cheese.  Salads were also worth noting as extraordinarily good, dressed just enough with ingredients like chicory, apple and other veggies taking it beyond just baby greens.  Pepper pasta, similar to carbonara, garlic/EVOO sauce and heat from black pepper, I was using my pizza crust to scrape up the sauce.  Whole branzino fish, roasted with a crispy seasoned skin, done perfectly such that I was sucking the meat off the little bones, so good !\n\nA definite under-the-radar gem among the many culinary choices in Yountville, make a reservation or can be a long wait.", "I've been wanting to try Ciccio for some time and I'm glad I finally did. The restaurant is on the smaller side and they don't take reservations but I loved the intimate feel of the space and the staff - both our waiter and the hostess were awesome.

For dessert we shared the coconut cream pie (YUM!!) seriously so so good. I'll be back to try their pastas for sure (also the fried pork chop looked amazing)!", "This restaurant reminds me of some of the funky little Italian spots we have in Florida. I love that the restaurant is kept darker and really sets a great date night mood. I know there are a million great restaurants in Napa but I don't know why this one is in slammed every single day. The pizza might've been one of the best pizzas I've had in a very long time. It was perfectly spicy and very addicting. The pasta was well cooked and the Bolognese was full of flavor. The tiramisu was good, it wasn't a game changer as the cookies were a bit on the dryer side.(more of a traditional tiramisu)  I would say order another pizza because I thought all the salty food really stole the show.", "Service from Josh was amazing and the food was great.\nI've passed by a few times and was finally able to check it out this weekend.  Our concierge at the hotel mentioned that they don't take reservations but most walk-ins usually take no more than 20 minutes or so.\n\nWe were there on a Sunday night and didn't have to wait longer than 10 minutes.  Our waiter, Josh was incredibly friendly and knew the menu very well.  \n\nWe ordered the fried octopus, crab dip with house made chips (delicious!).  The kids had the pepperoni pizza which was amazing.  We ordered two pasta dishes.  My husband loved his and I thought mine was good but not great.  We had a great time and will definitely return.

The portion for this dish was on the smaller side and didn't really fill me up, so if you have a big appetite, I would say pick another dish.\n\nRib-eye Special: my boyfriend got this dish and he said that it was cooked perfectly.\n\nDessert- Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Napoleon: I love Parkway Grill's take on the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It's so different but still contains the main components of a traditional creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e; it's sooo good. Definitely the highlight of the meal for me\n\nChocolate Hazelnut Roulade: Definitely not as good as the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e but I might also be biased because I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate, but my boyfriend thought it was really good.\n\nOverall, the entire meal was really enjoyable with great service and I can't wait to come back again.", "Perfect!!

The piano player in the bar entertained us all evening, very nice!!\n\nWe tried the shrimp corn dogs and crab cake to begin. The shrimp was great, very flavorful sauces. The crab cake had a very nice fruit salsa, and a great crunchy texture. My friend had the halibut special which came with creamed spinach. Perfectly prepared and flavorful. My prime NY steak was exactly medium rare the way I like it. Might have been the most perfectly cooked steak I've ever had. The layered dauphinois potatoes were incredible!!\n\nOh, I forgot the extreme bread presentation-be careful, you'll eat too much trying the different breads-you'll get full and not enjoy your entrees!!\n\nWe split the Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e Napoleon and had cappuccino to end a perfect dinner. Great atmosphere, great food, beautiful piano background, and stimulating conversation!

Free parking was a nice surprise for the Pasadena area, but the level of service was expected for the price.\n\nThe tiger shrimp corn dogs were delicious and recommended if you're not watching your diet. I ordered the whole catfish. It is deep fried and you get the entire fish from head to tail. Don't order if you're squeamish. I'm Asian, so I'm use to looking my protein in the face. The idea of the dish was fun and possibility tasty. But despite how big the fish was, you couldn't get much meat because it was over fried. So not much flavor either.\n\nI also tried someone's scallops. It was cooked just right, but the bed of risotto was a little too al dente for my liking. But a decent dish.  \n\nWe ordered the kumamoto oysters as an appetizers. It was good, but I've been eating a lot of oysters recently and it wasn't the best I've had.\n\nOverall come for the great service, ambiance, but it is definitely a splurge.", "What a pleasant surprise! Having been driving by this restaurant all these years, and not knowing the gem it awaits through those doors! Parkway Grill delivers a very classic culinary experience, as you'll expect going to an old school upscale dining place. The open kitchen restaurant is spacious, but feels very intimate, with the soft lighting and mahogany wood. The pianist and bass players do a good job providing a chill and jazzy vibe (and they take requests. Don't forget to tip!) The bartenders are sharp and work hard to delivery the perfect consistent cocktail, every time. The waitstaff is super friendly, professional and on point. Food is amazing. Our juicy steaks were seasoned and cooked to medium rare. Perfectly delicious! Probably one of the best steak I've had in awhile!

Maybe it just sounds like B.S. hyperbole, but my stance is founded. Again and again. This consistently, insanely fabulous food NEVER, ever disappoints.

And desserts for that matter!), the service is superb. (I swear I'm not related to any of the owners!) When not in the dining room, hanging at the bar sipping a dirty martini with Naz and Mark bustling about while listening to live piano with perfectly adjusted lighting with the largest, jaw-droppingly beautiful floral arrangement overseeing all the guests... just perfect.\n\nOne should travel not only from the Westside, but also from across the country just to enjoy this Pasadena staple.", "Must try for Pasadena. This is one of my favorite restaurant in Pasadena. There is a valet parking and the dining environment is great. Tuna tartare and crab cake is my favorite for appetizer. For steak, filet mignon is always my first choice and really good. Pasta and grilled fish are not impressive from my point of view.

Once inside there are sitting inside and in the back that is outside in the patio the place kinda seems like a house where you walk in you're in a living room cause of the size of the place and then you down a short hall way to the patio outside which seems like a backyard with picnic tables and there are tables with high chairs. The menu select was ok seems like most dishes were spicy. The staff was nice. I got the shrimp in chipotle, cheese and sauce since that seemed like the least spicy shrimp dish. The place had an A rating and a bunch of LA Weekly articles framed on the wall when you first walk in. So seems like this place is legit with good food. The downside is parking but other than that I would recommend this place.", "The promise of ceviche and shrimp cooked at least a dozen different ways brought some friends and I here, but we all agreed it was just okay.  The cooked shrimp dishes all seemed overdone, especially the CUCARACHITAS (shrimp fried in spicy butter sauce).  The shrimp, which come with shells and heads intact, just weren't plump at all.  Thankfully the SHRIMP COCKTAIL was better.  You get a big bowl full of peeled shrimp in broth.  Add some hot sauce and lime and enjoy.\n\nBut the best thing we had was the PESCADO ZARANDEADO (grilled snook with salt and house sauce).  I ordered it as soon as I arrived since it takes 30 minutes to prepare.  A jelly roll sheet came out with a large grilled fish laid out topped with cucumber slices and a side of grilled/stewed onions.  This fish was amazing and don't overlook those onions.  I would definitely come back for this.", "Amazing Mexican seafood, my favorite Mexican restaurant in LA.\n\nI have been here three or so times now, and every meal has been amazing. Forget everything you know about stereotypical Mexican food. Everything is incredibly fresh and natural tasting, with simple, bold, piquant flavors. The complimentary jalape\u00f1o salsa served with chips is sharp and flavorful, with a citrus lime cilantro and pepper flavor that is unlike any other salsa I've had. The snook that followed was cooked to a buttery savory perfection, and was more than enough for three people of average appetite. Thankfully, I was the only one in my party who wanted the fish skin, so I had it all to myself.\n\nThis place is a culinary experience for a comparatively modest price. Don't be deterred by its location, I found it to be safe and quiet during the day.\n\nService was fine, I like that they don't pester you and leave you to yourself unless you ask otherwise. The TV is annoying but I just turn it down when I walk in.\n\nMake sure to dine in the outdoor patio behind the front room - I missed it but it's a nice open air area for dining.", "This place is shrimp heaven! My husband loooves shrimp and we had to come here. Just the two of us ordered the cevichsushi, camarones al mojo de ajo, and the ceviche marinero. my favorite was the camarones al mojo de ajo because it was head on shrimp and you can taste if the shrimp is fresh based on the head. it was very tasty. Of the ceviches we enjoyed the marinero one more because of the black sauce, it's different from ceviches we've had at other places. The best part was the big basket of tortilla chips and green salsa, there was plenty of chips to eat with our dishes. I will definitely want to come back again to try the other dishes. The parking \"lot\" consists of probably 3-4 spots, however there's plenty of street parking on Imperial Highway.", "Yes there is a wait and yes service is slow. The food however is always made with love and it is perfection. This place is always busy and expect to wait, have a beer and relax, you will not be disapproved when the food arrives. The seafood is cleaned appropriately and very well made. If you are in a rush and hungry, this is not the place to be. Come here expecting to wait and you will walk out happy you came. I think this is a family owned and operated restaurant, they are not just sitting there doing nothing and it it is clear that they are busy. There is a reason why their menu prices are competitive.

Thank you to the chef and the kitchen staff that are working diligently to serve a plate of perfection, I most humbly wait.", "Ok, this little seafood Mexican place was so great. From the gray interior walls and rustic tables and chairs. Very comfortable and roomy. One server handled all the tables just fine. Even the few tables out back. If it was warmer, we would have sat outside. The patio is large and nicely appointed with large tables. If you blink driving by, you'll miss the place. Not huge, but large enough. I had the shrimp with jalape\u00f1o cheese crema sauce. They don't skimp on the amount of shrimps that we're deliciously coated in light green sauce to perfection. The rice is fluffy, light, and seasoned with something I've never had before. The garnish is two raw red onion rings and cucumber sliced to cut the extremely hot Serrano lime salsa. Just perfect.

They are a masterpiece in a small package.  One (maybe two) is all you really need.\n\nThe rest of the menu is solid.  The spreads work well for crowds.  The bread is a bit dry but comes with a dry salty feta-ish cheese that packs a punch.  Anything off the grill is pretty good.  I usually got the lunch salad with chicken brochette (always tasty and juicy).  The lamb burger is also good (but it's no lamb taco).\n\nThe meal isn't cheap but it works for a business outing.

It's a hefty burger that's very satisfying. The burger is meaty and juicy with the slightly trangy goats milk cheese a nice counterpoint to all that unctuous meat.

Don't know why it was such a miss. Rice or beans had no flavor. Didn't even know it could be like that. I gave it 5 stars cuz the tacos but a definite 0 on the burrito. Couldn't even finish it.

Their steak is flavorful and juicy with just the right amount of crispiness. They grill it fresh and chop it up on a wood block when you order it, that's why it taste so juicy and succulent.\nI tried most of their other meats but the carne asada stands out by far.\n\nTheir salad bar is amazing, best green salsa ever. They are very generous with the chunks of avocado in the green salsa. And it's hella spicy but its a creeper so beware cos that green salsa is so good you may not notice how spicy it is til it's too late! They have a great variety of salsas here.

The fish was very light and flavorful, and it came with a lovely tartar sauce. My boyfriend had the premium pasty and it was so good. The crust is so flaky! He also got an order of the deluxe chips.\n\nOur meal on Friday was so good that we ended up going back for lunch Saturday. I got the chicken balti pasty and loved the subtle curry flavor. My boyfriend got the steak and ale. It was very comforting, like a beef stew in a sturdy pastry shell. We also tried their house made sodas. They were fabulous! Of course, we had to split an order of the deluxe chips to make it a well rounded meal.\n\nThere were quite a few people there each time we visited. I am very excited for such a unique and wonderful new restaurant in Bridgeport. It is a little pricey, but oh so good. We will be back again soon.", "My husband and I brought a couple friend of ours and we all loved it! We all had the kale and mushroom pie - thick pie crust but soft enough to go well with the filling and not go soggy. Filling was nice and creamy and really good blend of the ingredients. We also added mashed potatoes and peas as sides to go with our pies and made it even more amazing. I love their curry fries even more! Just enough crunch on the outside and very soft inside. Good seasoned fries and curry was a nice touch.\n\nI also don't typically like ginger beer but their ginger drink was nice and refreshing. Not your typical strong flavor but you can still taste the ginger.\n\nThe place itself was nice - not too crowded when we were there. Our waitress was personable and attentive.

I came in here just before closing to pick a little dessert up so I could bring it next door to Maria's (they have an agreement to allow food from Pleasant House).  I had the last of their trifle, and it was delicious.  Lots of whipped cream and fresh fruit.  The shortbread in it was soft and buttery.  Yum!  Looking at the rest of the menu, my mouth watered for more.  They have gravy fries, drool...  And for dessert, they deep fry mars bars.  I'm not a big fan of mars bars, but when you drop them in boiling hot oil, I'm in!  Can't wait for their food truck!", "Tried the mac-and-cheese with bacon pie last week; pretty tasty.

The banana cream pie dessert was pretty tasty also.  BYO baby!", "Everything I've ever ordered from here is just.....mmmmmm. I've tried all their pot pies, and I zero complaints about any of them.

My friend had the Rolovane Suve Sljive I Dzigerica (prunes stuffed with walnuts and cheese rolled in bacon with chicken liver rolled in bacon), which he said was divine and hearty. I had the soup of the day, a fish soup, and the beet + celery root salad. They were tasty and different.\n\nI was actually quite fond of the cheese meze. The cheeses were rich and abundant.

The pork was tender and moist, and I especially enjoyed flavor from the thin layer of fat that lined the meat. It was a bit salty but I like salty food so I didn't mind too much. The dish was served with side salad of romaine lettuce and some sort of vinaigrette.\nSpinach Pie (Zeljanica): I had a bite of my friend's Spinach Pie. We were both weary that the feta cheese would overpower the dish, but I thought it was well balanced with the spinach and phyllo pastry. The texture wasn't what I expected - it was like a more-gelatinous quiche - but I assume that's how it is traditionally made.\n\nThe dim lighting makes for a romantic atmosphere, and the decor made me feel like I was truly experiencing Serbian culture.", "It's been five years since I've last been at Kafana, but when I recently stopped in, I wished that it hadn't been such a delay since my return.\n\nSome friends, including a couple of visitors from out of town, stopped in on a snowy night and were greeted kindly by one of the staff. The place is small, intimate for sure, but I loved that it never felt crowded or overrun. Between our party of six, we shared the dried meats dish as well as the cheese bread (both delicious!) and we ordered the daily fish (branzino, $22), as well as the sausage and beans, the kafana burger, as well as the lamb and kale stew (all averaging around $16ish), and split two bottles of wine.\n\nUnfortunately the stove pilot light went out so we weren't able to order a couple of dishes, but that couldn't be helped.

Notes of brisket and bacon in the meat. Could eat three of these but must save room for the meal. On the traditional theme, try the grilled minced meat (cevapi). Plenty of small sausages. Slightly salty and satisfying. Bean stew with smoked baby back ribs (corbast pasulj sa dimljenim rebarcima) is a baked bean lovers paradise. More like a thick soup than a stew.

Both were well executed and delicious. Prices were very reasonable and so many interesting dishes we want to try. We will definitely be back!", "Five stars does not do Ciccia Osteria justice! If I could give this place 20 stars, I would in a heartbeat! We absolutely love it here. My fianc\u00e9 and I have been coming here since they opened and it honestly gets better every single time. The homemade foccacia, the INCREDIBLE olive oil/balsamic/cheese concoction they place out on your table when you first walk in, the wine list, the FOOD, gosh, everything is just absolutely outstanding. But even more incredible than the food itself are the people. Francesca and Mario are just an absolute dream team. They make you feel like you're family, and like you're truly coming into their home and sitting at their table. This place is so much more than a restaurant. It's a home, it's an experience, it's an absolute delight. We are so grateful to have had yet another amazing time at Ciccia just last night where Axel was our waiter and did an OUTSTANDING job at making us feel at home, as we always do! It was his 5th day and it might as well have been his 5-year anniversary. He was a total natural and so friendly, accommodating, just everything great. We love this place so much we're hoping to have our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding! DO NOT MISS OUT on this place!", "Ciccia is a hidden gem of Barrio Logan. It's a charming house that was converted into a restaurant where Chef Francesca makes fresh pasta and Mario, her husband curates the wine list. Ciccia is our favorite Italian restaurant in town, with a variety of choices, including gluten-free and vegan dishes. I held my private wedding dinner upstairs (holds 18) and it was absolutely perfect. Francesca and Mario made us feel like family and created the most special experience. They are experts with years of experience, however humble in their craft and product. I highly recommend Ciccia! Go Hungry!!", "These chefs are doing something special: creating new flavors for right here and right now, while staying true to Italian traditions. They do not crash flavors together to be flashy or impress you. They seem to be delighting their own palettes and offering you a taste.\n\nIt was cold so we sat inside, not out in the charming ficus garden. A bread basket was served with a decadent spread of mascarpone/truffle oil, we had to remind ourselves to save room for our meal.\nWe ordered: 1) the roasted vegetable salad with shrimp 2) the mushroom flan, 3) the pappardelle and 4) the sombreri. For dessert, we had the Cassata and the Ricotta cake with apricot. Take a look at the photos posted on this site, every dish was perfectly prepared and delicious. We had chianti riserva with the meal, and espresso after, served in pretty demitasse cups with demitasse spoons, as it should be, but isn't always. The service was prompt and attentive, and I do love being asked if I am ready for the next course, a courtesy hard to find these days.\n\nWe live in Little Italy, where there is no shortage of good food. This gem of a restaurant gives us reason to leave our neighborhood.  Thanks so much for a wonder meal, and we will be back!", "Decided to come here for my birthday dinner last night after much research since we're not from the area. We had the most amazing experience, at first I thought the concept of walking up to the counter to order and pay was strange but I ended up really enjoying the whole process. We loved the table bread and spread it came with so much, the even brought out a vegan spread for my friend who ordered off the vegan menu. We had the mushroom flan as an appetizer and oh my gosh was it to die for and I would come back to this place just to eat this. We also had the tricolore salad which I'm going to attempt to recreate in my kitchen. The side of truffle mushrooms were also amazing and I think that I ordered the best dish which was the braised beef stuffed ravioli. So so so good! I also tried my friends vegan dishes and loved every bite. The ambiance on the patio is so quaint and romantic there's a big table with a fire pit in the middle which made the atmosphere very cozy.

Today we did and it was worth it. My wife and I bought a pound of bbq ribs and a sausage and sides of potato salad and Texas chili. All of them were excellent. The ribs and sausage are cooked Texas style in a smoker and they were delicious. My wife and I ate at Franklin's in Austin a couple of years and we thought the ribs and sausage were as good as Franklin's. Now you don't need to go to Austin! You can have truly great bbq in San Juan Capistrano. The potato salad and Texas chili sides were equally first rate. And I had an IPA from Capistrano brewing company, which tasted great with the food. The staff are very friendly. As it's a take-out restaurant with no indoor dining at all it's Covid safe. I guess the only thing to consider is that it is on the pricey side. But with food this good it's worth paying for it. Plus, be beware they close when they sell out of food. On one of our earlier attempts to eat there they were sold out at 4:20pm. Be on the safe side and get there early!", "UPDATE\nCame back again today. Just as amazing!\n\nHad brisket, pulled pork, pork spare ribs, and both sausages for the day. Both sausages were excellent, but the spicy hot link was best.\n\nThe beans are never my favorite. They are good. Worth a try. But I think lacking a bit.\n\nThe corn, it's legit. It's like a cream corn, with a Mexican flare to it. Excellent must try.\n\nAll the Mac n cheeses are good. But in my opinion, the chorizo Mac is by far the best. Pesto Mac falls in last place.\n\nCornbread muffins are amazing. Not too spicy. But filled with flavor. Get a few of them....unless they are sold out. Everyone is realizing how good these are.\n\nThe brisket and spare ribs are my favorite here. Danny knows how to cook a spare rib. These are so flavorful and tender. It's amazing. You won't be disappointed. Banana pudding is a must as well. Perfect way to cap off an already filing meal", "These poor OC folks who are raving about this place have never had actual good bbq. Also, Heritage's social media marketing person is top notch, which is why they're able to draw the crowds. But food? No way.\n\nGranted, not everyone has been to Texas or Tennessee, but even Lucille's and Famous Dave's beats out Heritage in terms of taste and quality.\n\nWe ordered some of everything: the ono plate (pork belly and brisket, with rice and Hawaiian Mac salad), sausage, pulled pork, ribs, more brisket, chili and sausage mac & cheese. We sat there and ate everything piping hot. The two stars in this review are solely for the chili and for the Hawaiian Mac salad - these were stellar.\n\nEverything else was absolutely terrible. We've never had such bad pulled pork before and you can honestly make better pulled pork in your slow cooker at home. Pork belly was rubbery and disgusting. Ribs were dry. Brisket was so salty and not tender. Sausage was mediocre.\n\nSave your time and money and go somewhere that isn't hyped up. While it's cool to have a \"roadside bbq\" where you can get a huge tray of meat straight from the smoker, it's simply just not good-tasting or good quality food. Pass.", "The best thing on the platter was the Mexican cream corn - lots of flavor and delicious.\n\nThe brisket lacked flavor and was a little dry for my liking. The sausage of the day (jalape\u00f1o cheddar) was good and rich.\n\nDrove 2 hours to try this place since finding good BBQ in California is like finding a needle in a haystack. However, the drive combined with the 2 hour wait just didn't make it worth it.\n\nThe staff were friendly. No one really paid attention to their attempts at spacing until inside the gates.\n\nThe space itself is super cute but could use sunshades.", "Great bbq! I've been to Lockhart, Texas for some of the most amazing bbq ever and this spot is pretty darn close to the real deal! The brisket was moist, ribs were fantastic with that flavorful bark and the beans with chunks of brisket were amazing. I also had the garlic and pork sausage as well; this was \"ok\" but worth a try for sure. No doubt that I will be back. I tried my friend's pulled pork and it was very moist and flavorful. Next time I'll try the potato salad and that pulled pork along with more ribs. Overall, delicious bbq that won't disappoint. Bonus: it shares the building  with Capistrano Brewery.

There is also an assortment of sides like Mac n cheese, salads, bread, and vegetables.\n- Additionally, Heritage offers specials such as tacos and nachos.\n- This is the closest we've had to real Texas bbq here in SoCal, and the food is delicious.

They even have a small pan frying station where they prepare certain dishes like pan fried sticky rice, rice noodles, and more.\n\nNeedless to say, this place is definitely a top pick for all dim sum lovers. My only one complaint here is that the food may be a little bit greasy, but you can say the same for all other dim sum places because dim sum tends to be a bit greasy. It's not a problem though because the food itself and the overall dining experience here is great and worth it all.\n\nParking may be difficult, so come early to find a spot and to reserve a table as the wait can get pretty long during the holidays and weekends.", "Pretty awesome authentic Chinese spot at the corner of Millbrae and El Camino in Millbrae.

And the hot and sour soup. Needed a bit of soy sauce, but also great.\n\nSalt-baked prawns were really good if dry and the saut\u00e9ed chicken was really luscious.\n\nFinally, we had Eu-Fu noodles with mushrooms and chicken fried rice.

Disorganized and corrupted. Came here on a Saturday for brunch, and waited for more than 1 hour. Observed some disgusting things. People cutting lines. Normally/supposedly you get a number and wait for the call. However, there are so many people that just go straight in and look for the managers. There are a couple managers on site, and each manager will get those who they knew seated right away without having to wait in line like everybody else. Corrupted from the management level is a disgusting discover. Maybe this is typical in the Cantonese community. And another thing is the customers. Some of the customers are so aggressive and as soon as one table is cleared they immediately sits down and take over that table. The managers and staff members sees them and does nothing, instead they still serve those barbarians. Maybe the staff knew them or they just perform based on their mood.

For my main meal  had the pork that came with two small pieces of pork loin and 2 pieces of pork belly. I didn't care much for the pork belly but the loin was great. We also had the rack of lamb which was perfectly cooked.\nPortions are fairly small so we did have room for dessert afterwards. We went with the Cube and  the hazelnut gianduja.

At 5:15 the table right next to us was seated with another couple while the next two tables remained empty for the next 45 minutes. Why would the host not put them further away and give both parties more personal space for a longer time? I also felt that the decor was really lacking.

Maryland crab cake piled atop a fluffy brioche and slathered with herb a\u00efoli tastes of summer by the sea.", "yelp_reviews": ["This is a dependable place to get fish/seafood; always hopping when I stop by. The consistent crowds confirm that Millie knows what she's doing.\n\nThe various menus are a mix of classic recipes, salads and trendy items. The Nantucket/New England influence is found a bit in the cooking, but does not dominate.\n\nI appreciate the smoked bluefish pate (appetizer); it's smooth, with just the right touch of smoldering. The rainbow trout entr\u00e9e is noteworthy and arrives with a most spectacular spoon summer corn bread. It's just about the best darn thing I've tasted this year. It's really more of a souffl\u00e9--spongy, buttery, and luscious. The fish tacos are smartly done; enjoy the one called Hither Creek which features rockfish. However the rice salad that accompanies seems an afterthought.\n\nAll walks of life are eating here: families; professionals, couples, singles, groups of all sorts, young and old.\n\nThe seating is tight inside, particularly when it's going at full tilt. Outdoors, there is more room to stretch out.\n\nWait staff is competent given the large numbers of customers who slam this spot at peak feeding times.", "It's true this place gets knocked for being a magnet for the preppy and pretentious. But as a resident of this neighborhood, I can't tell you how much life it has brought to our community, after a succession of mediocre establishments tried in this historic location for decades. This place absolutely rocks! The food and drink are just excellent across the board, the ambience and decor are simply beautiful, and the staff has always been friendly, welcoming and genuine. Our long-standing favorites since this place opened include the clam chowder and the crab fried rice, although I don't think you can go wrong with any of the menu items. Last night I asked if they had a side salad, and they offered me something off-menu that turned out to be a revelation: greens, grape tomatoes and chickpeas with a breath of cumin. For dessert they have a walk-up ice cream window. There is plenty of outdoor seating, including a large patio for meals and a bar area with high-top tables.", "Millie's is the true neighborhood joint in Spring Valley in NW DC. If you drive by on a warm weathered day, the crowds will inspire you to stop to grab a table. The inside space is large and they have an equally big outdoor patio with an ice cream stand in the middle of it.\n\nThe menu is Mexican and a bit of everything. My wife and I opted for appetizers and the burrata and strawberries and potstickers were great. Our toddler's chicken finger platter was enjoyable. Their signature frose was not too sweet or bitter- so refreshing!\n\nThe service was spot on as well!", "This is a super popular seafood option in this side of the town. I really enjoyed the soft shell crabs and heard that the seared tuna tacos and the lobster entree were very good too. We also enjoyed the general vibe of the place. My single complaint is about the long wait lines. Otherwise a great place for a weekend brunch for family and friends.", "Had an opportunity to eat at Millie's today with a colleague for lunch. Was very impressed with the ambience and outdoor patio. Great setting and decor.  However....Service was not good - at all. Sat for a very long time with no one coming to our table or bringing the drinks we ordered with the bartender who seated us. Eventually flagged down a server to take our order. The food came rather  promptly by a food runner but never saw the server until we had to (again) flag him down for the check. Server's name we learned from the check was Brian- not sure if it was an issue of being short staffed or lack of attention, but he was in over his head but didn't seem to notice- also concerning. Never an apology from him for his lack of attention. Also- did not see a manager on the floor even though it was the dead  of lunch. Food was acceptable- though for the price it should be accompanied with a certain level of service. It's a shame- so much potential to be great but in this competitive market, it falls short of what the guest expects and should demand for the price.", "This is basically a sandwich shop that serves tacos and quesadillas rather than sandwiches trying to pass itself off as a legitimate sit down restaurant. While the food is fine, the setting is underwhelming. The open air concept is good, but the menu (and prices) suggest this is a nice place to have an evening out with friends. The reality is that once you leave the bar area the seating is on picnic tables with an ice cream window less than 20 feet away. It is very family friendly which is great for families on a summer night that want ice cream but bad for actual diners as kids are allowed to run throughout the outdoor area. We even had two kids on scooters weave between us and the table behind us. I would expect better when the tab was over $100 for three of us (admittedly, there were 5 drinks on the tab). In addition, the service was very slow. On a positive note, the craft beer selection was good as was the queso; however, $9 for quest and A basket of chips (correct, nothing complementary) when the menu is dominated by tacos and quesadillas seems extremely expensive. Overall, a very disappointing experience. We'd probably return for a lunch (maybe) but this doesn't qualify as a location to spend an evening.", "I LOOOOVVVVEEEE the blueberry ice cream and it's sad bc sometime I just come for it. I also love their poke and crab cake salad. The service has been inconsistent with really good and okay so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars but I love the food and outdoor seating."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/millies-spring-valley-washington?hrid=cCjKSL9Z8PL6ZKVRUok_lw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/millies-spring-valley-washington?hrid=ruolTK84pFRnXWMAKlEVtA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/millies-spring-valley-washington?hrid=wPPsEcO_agnZTR5GcYPSLg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/millies-spring-valley-washington?hrid=Q8dO9Y04C02qbxI-oifaSw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/millies-spring-valley-washington?hrid=yZway8G0ZnvyVqsztUdPuA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/millies-spring-valley-washington?hrid=KVevBNIJaxyPOhfT1uPFBA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/millies-spring-valley-washington?hrid=iRd92xDeDzJOYyZm6VNb1A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Manuela", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/manuela-los-angeles-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-los-angeles/restaurant/manuela", "michelin_pov": "This large \"enclosed\" restaurant is tucked inside the multi-use Hauser & Wirth Arts Complex.

The decor is nice, clean, upscale, and fancy, making for a perfect spot for a special occasion.\n\nTo eat, I ordered the Venison Burger, priced around $22. To pair with it, I ordered a Juicy Hazy IPA from Barrelhouse ($8). This restaurant isn't the cheapest in town, but the quality speaks for itself. My burger was definitely satisfying and flavorful, an item I would order again and recommend to others.\n\nIf looking for a cool brunch restaurant in the Arts District of Los Angeles, Manuela is a pretty good option. The setting is beautiful, and after your meal, you can walk around and check out the art exhibits. Service is friendly and efficient, though maybe not the quickest in terms of drinks. Go ahead and give this place a try!", "Really nice outdoor dining area.  Beautiful and spacious place. The food is fresh, beautifully plated, and delicious.  \n\nFood:\n-Yellowtail ceviche with cucumber, avocado, radish, ginger-lime, and benne seeds.  Comes with nice and crisp chips. It was very refreshing and balanced. MUST ORDER!\n-Gulf pink shrimp bruschetta with cherry tomato, opal basil, fennel, and garlic toast.  Very citrusy but also very yummy but the shrimp is tiny.\n-Roasted cauliflower with date vinegar and almonds was delightful and crunchy.\n\nThe drinks were also pretty good, right amount of alcohol, and tasty. They also had an IPA for San Diego that I have never tried before with an abv of 7%. Tasted really good, light, and refreshing.\n\nWill definitely be back.", "This place was recommended to me by my foodie friend so of course you know it had to be good. They are operating on a reservation only basis right now I believe. Many walk in parties got turned away while we were waiting for our reservation. This place is b u s y, and for a reason.\n\nMy friend told me about their venison burger and it sounded interesting so we drove up to give it a try. It was one of the juiciest burgers I've ever had. It was a delicate, yet simple burger with a few toppings that complimented the burger that you could taste. The pickled green tomatoe and arugula gave it a nice twist. The fried leeks were unique but not my favorite. The yellowtail ceviche was the perfect starter I could eat two plates of those. We got thick cut bacon for my daughter and she loved it. Lastly, the creamed biscuits was worth every calorie.", "I took my fianc\u00e9 to Manuela for date night last night and it did not disappoint!\n\nFirst off, please avoid the arts district parking headache and just opt for valet. The guys were really friendly and fair making sure each car was parked based on arrival time. Some lady tried to cut in front of me and valet guy told her to get to the end of the line.  Very much appreciated!\n\nThe restaurant was really busy given its Saturday night but the staff were all so friendly and attentive. Despite being located inside an industrial building, Manuela has such a great vibe. From the plants, to the paintings, and open seating area- it was just fun to be there. We ordered the aguachile shrimp, duck, pork chop, and potato balls. All dishes tasted amazing and our meat was so tender. We didn't do any dessert because we were so full from dinner.

There is a nice outdoor area that has ceiling mounted heaters so you don't get cold on those frigid SoCal evenings.  \n\nThey have a full bar, good wine selection, and a fun specialty cocktail list.  Some evenings call for a just a good old margarita and the skinny margarita at Manuela is excellent.  \n\nThe food is also very good.  I  like the ceviche, it's fresh but needs more spice.  It's a bit boring, I put the hot sauce that came with hush puppies on mine and that elevated it!  It comes with red sweet potato chips that were not just beautiful but light and crisp so they paired well with the ceviche.  We also tried the cauliflower which was colorful and very well seasoned.  Finally, the hush puppies- the butter that came with them was the best part.  But I think it's just me, hush puppies aren't my thing, too dense.

I had heard a lot of good things about Manuela so made it a point to come when I was in the area. I would recommend making a reservation on Resy if you can. We were fortunate enough to get a spot at the bar (looked like they were a handful of empty tables reserved). The decor here is subtle and hip, with nice wooden ceilings, marble bar, and an old school map for wall art. Bar seating is pretty awesome since it gets you a view into the open kitchen.\n\nCocktails here are tasty, just the right about of sweetness, but maybe could be a little more alcoholic. I got the Rattlesnake and would definitely get it again.\n\nFood: Redneck is really good and great for the table. The biscuits are oh-so nice and buttery, and the cheese and ham were top notch. Hushpuppies were pretty decent and pretty decadent in butter. The ceviche was light, fresh, and seasoned well. The shrimp and grits I thought was good - really creamy and just evaporated in your mouth, but of the dishes we got, most felt it was the weakest of the four.\n\nAn awesome place.

Wine options were thoughtful to menu offerings!  Wait staff are so warm and welcoming you want to stay for hours!  They are also EXTREMELY knowledgeable - they take pride in the food and wine served here.  It was refreshing and infectious to be around such enthusiasm.  \n\nHomemade pasta was the super win - Belotti also offers gluten free noodles - woohoo!  Residental parking nearby was relatively easy on a busy Friday eve. Our watermelon salad was super fresh and hearty.  The panna cotta with raspberry sauce melted me at the knees - still have dreams about its custardy goodness.\n\nCons (shallow observations on ambiance): The artwork is very hotel lobby-ish IMHO- be good to get something on the walls that matches the wonderful personality and liveliness that the staff exudes.  \n\nCan be a tight squeeze - website photos were misleading.  The venue is extremely cozy.  Great for date night or small group of foodies.    We had a 9p reservation and the place was packed - yet noise levels stayed at a boisterous Italian family level so I felt right at home.  \n\nWe'll definitely return for the lethal combination of stellar food and amazing vibe!! A++++", "I can never seem to get a reservation here but we went around 5:15 and were lucky to score two seats at the bar. It was packed by 5:30, yikes! From top to bottom our meal was excellent. We had manhattans to start (love that they have the large ice cubes) along with the tartare which had excellent flavor and was also a work of art. For dinner we had the AGNOLOTTI and the TORTELLI, both were so yummy and yet different with beautiful flavor profiles. The Agnolotti has a decadent beef reduction sauce that is incredible. The Tortelli was equally as good but had more sauce with meat with subtle hints of thyme. We finished with the tiramisu which was heavenly and yet light. My Brunello wine was also great, props to the bartender for recommending it!

I ordered the Brussels sprouts with fried eggs which is a dish I've never had anywhere else. The sprouts were fabulous and mixed with a tikka masala sauce which added the perfect amount of spice and flavor to the dish. Definitely not a very heavy entree which left me feeling satisfied but not too stuffed.\n\nMy friend ordered the blueberry pancakes with mascarpone and this dish was A+.

Glad to have more neighborhood restaurants to try!", "We had a great time here. It's a sister restaurant to Michelin star restaurant next door. The nigiri here are the best items on the menu given that half of the items get flown from tsujiki market in Tokyo on a daily basis (on the special menu addition)\n\nWe had the scallop and sea bream nigiri - they are excellent. They ran out of the premium scallops from japan - even the other one was pretty damn good.\n\nAlso they ran out of dessert so asked Omakase to see if they had any dessert upon our request. It was a Japanese custard with sorbet. Just fabulous and beautifully presented! Not too sweet. The custard is light and fragrant with the chilled sorbet - the combination was exquisite. So glad that they made the exception for us here.\n\nAll the other dishes are solid but not exceptional:\nSnow crab with cucumber - pretty food. Lots of crab - served a bit too chilled for my taste.\n\nWagyu and tuna roll - not sure if I love the surf and turf combination here.\n\nVegetable and shrimp tempura - large portion. Pretty filling. Not oily.\n\nSake infused Alaskan cod - cod is difficult to do without being too fishy. For this preparation, the cod is a bit too fishy for me.", "I went to Okane with several friends from SF and NYC hoping for a fun casual dinner and we were not let down. The fish here is extremely fresh and delicious and the small plates were great. The karaage is a must try. We split one plate and ended up ordering 2 more. The grilled shiitakes were also really good.\n\nOur favorite sushi were the various bellies - toro, salmon belly (special that night), one other I forget. They were out of aji, but had shima-aji which was just as delicious. The ginza and shinjuku rolls are great. The toched A5 on the shinjuku is just as extravagant as it sounds. We also had the harajuku and asakusa which were great, but I'm sure any of them would be great. The fish is fresh and the combinations go well.\n\nThey have a good sake list and we tried a few different bottles which our server recommended.

Its a fun spot with good food, will definitely be back.", "WOW!!! JUST WOW! That was, by far, the best authentic sushi I have ever had. The freshness, the quality, the utter perfection of every single piece of sushi that was served was like nothing I had ever had before. The head chef here is Lee-San and Kent is the master manager. Their roles might be great but their Omakase style sushi is by far the most amazing Omakase you will ever have. For those who don't know, \"Omakase\" is basically the chefs selection of hand crafted sushi that he makes on the spot. Lee-San is a master at this. No sriracha or spicy mayo or soy sauce necessary. Just trust the man, he's the best in all of SF. The service and the staff is amazing as well, all kudos go to Kent, the manager master. I can't say enough good stuff about this place so I will just end with this...\n\nLee-San is like an artist, and sushi is his canvas. Trust him, try his Omakase style sushi, your taste buds will thank you!", "Was in San Francisco for two days and craved some last minute Sushi. This place was open for lunch on Sunday so I decided to pop in. The rolls were 5 Star fantastic. I got both of their Salmon rolls, one topped with unagi and the other topped with tuna. The unagi was so perfectly cooked it quite literally melted in your mouth.\n\nI would give this place five stars except for the completely overpriced let down of of the chef's seasonal selection of the shashimi. 30 dollars, 8 pieces, I thought I was about to get the best shashimi of my life at that price point. The salmon sashimi was very good but the other three fish selections were no where near what I would expect to get at that price point and on such a premiere menu item.\n\nSave yourself the money, only get the rolls. You'll have a five star experience", "Came here cause we didn't want to wait at dumpling house, didn't know they were sister restaurants along with omakase! Really good dining experience here. Great food, and even better service (Gary is awesome!). We got the uni nigiri (hokkaido is more expensive, but so sweet and not overly sea-tasting), the beef sukiyaki (really good on a cold day- lots of fun stuff inside), and the harajuku roll (really like the lotus chips on top- a little spicy- but not too much).

This new restaurant comes from former-Eleven Madison Park's chef and that's all you really need know (but I will share more).\n\nIf there was a blog for the best table bread in the states I can quite confidently tell you this restaurant would represent New York City and probably even take it home. To be honest calling it 'bread' does not do it justice, we loved it so much we asked for \"more\" 2 more times.\n\nDishes that stood out was the table bread (did I mention that?) the gruyere fritters and cauliflower both gorgeous entrees, red snapper crudo and the branzino. Chicken was succulent with a crisp finish, a fair portion and could definitely be shared.\n\nGo and go soon.", "All those red stars you are seeing are well-earned. Attentive and informative service without being intrusive.  The setting is very interesting and understated with a good bar vibe.  As for the food...well...that's why you're here.  \n\nHad the carrots in a foam with razor clams; peaches and tomato salad; charred octopus and the brined chicken.  Each dish was absolutely delicious and prepared with thought and care.\n\nDessert was off the charts.  Sticky Toffee Pudding was offset perfectly with a side slather of creme. Oh and that Orange/creamsicle-like ice cream w roasted marshmallow and crunchy honeycomb...nuf' said.  \n\nMy two cents: GO!", "I really wanted to give Crown Shy five stars and I suspect that this is a place that will indeed get better over time. Crown Shy is the first of three initiatives (two restaurants and a rooftop bar) at the old AIG headquarters on Pine Street by Eleven Madison Park/Nomad alums. With one of the finest Art Deco lobbies in the city, 70 Pine is an amazing building harkening back to a different era in our City and Country's financial history. Luckily the food does not. The food is imaginative and delicious. Everything you would expect from a former Eleven Madison Park chef de cuisine. The room is also beautiful. It is clear though that they are not yet as accomplished as restauranteurs as they are chefs, but over the service is good and will no doubt get much better.", "The food was delicious and the service was great. Our main complaint was the timing of the food. We ordered plates to share, which seemed normal, but was about a 30 minute wait between our appetizers and our pastas. Then it was about another 15 minutes after the pasta before we received 1 of our 2 entrees; the short ribs eventually came out. I expect better from an establishment like this.\n\nWe enjoyed all of the dishes ordered:\n- Gruyere Fritters, Chili, Lime\n- Tuna Crudo, Husk Cherry, Pistachio, Chili\n- Bucatini, Spring Pea, Morel\n- Octopus a la Plancha, Chorizo, Summer Squash\n- Citrus-Marinated Chicken, Crown Shy Hot Sauce\n- Roasted Short Rib, Braised Ends, Potato, Chimichurri", "Superlicious food, great service, and amazing atmosphere and ambience. Highly recommend the Romain salad, gruyere fritters, the chicken ... basically anything and everything on the menu.

This restaurant itself, looks beautiful but the food was even better...wow!\n\nOrdered the beef carpaccio as a starter. This was delicious and came with a lot of lettuce and salad on top. Also got their English pea ravioli which consisted of 1 ravioli the size of your palm for $17.50 but never had a dish or tasted anything like this. Inside was an egg yolk with black truffles and asparagus and peas on the outside. Tasted so good with all of the parmesan cheese on top. Was all veggies but a very unique dish.  Highly recommend this one.\n\nFor dinner I had the duck sugo orecchiette ($24.50) which was a large pasta dish with thin meat slices of duck. The sauce was thick and creamy and was very good. My sister got one of their specials, the halibut and thought it was really good as well. Service and atmosphere at this place was top notch. I think I found my favorite restaurant in La Jolla and it isn't along the cliffs either!", "We stopped by here for a late lunch after a long and windy day of walking! The restaurant is located on the third floor of a shopping plaza. The place has great ambience and decor. The menu is not extensive, but everything we ordered was amazing! The hubby ordered the margherita pizza and I ordered the soup of the day (mushroom) and the tagliatelle all portofino (genovese basil pesto and creamy tomato sauce) to share with the kiddo. First of all, let me just say, that the mushroom soup was the tastiest soup I have ever had! Soooooo yummy and unctuous! Perfect! The tagliatelle (with homemade pasta) was delicious! The kiddo, hubby  and I inhaled it (yes, the hubby ate his pizza and then finished up our food as well)!  The hubby said his pizza was the bomb...perfect neapolitan style. If you are in the area...definitely try this place out!", "It's been a year since I've lunched in La Jolla and my friend made reservations for the 2 of us at Catania.\n\nLocated on the top floor of La Plaza center, so you have views of the ocean & La Jolla Village.  \n\nUpon arrival, they offered us a variety of seating, and we opted for a peek-a-boo view because it was slightly chilly.\n\nServer immediately came over to take our drink order; a Chardonnay for me.\n\nI wanted something light and ordered the chopped salad.  However, my friend insisted I try the Arancini, so we ordered that as our starter.\n\nArancini was very rich and delicious.  Much more filling and decadent than I expected.\nThe Chopped salad was more my speed; little gem lettuce, salami, corona beans, red wine vinaigrette, etc.\n\nLovely lunch and would definitely return.", "I had dinner here last Friday with a friend, and I will start by saying that we received great service. The food however was a bit disappointing, this could however have been due to the fact that this place came highly recommended so we had really high expectations. We ordered the ARUGULA SALAD, the BUCATINI ALL' AMATRICIANA, and the ROASTED YOUNG CHICKEN. The salad was fantastic, but the pasta was just average, and the roasted chicken (which was actually game hen) had an overly smoked flavor. This place has a great view, and beautiful decor, but is definitely not the kind of place you should go if you are trying to hold a conversation. It was very loud and we could hear every dish being washed in the kitchen from the dining room. It was also extremely dark and the couple at the table next to us kept asking if there was anything they could do to get more light because they couldn't even see there menus. I might give this place another try just to grab a drink with a group of people.", "You could go to the touristy George's at the Cove or Eddie V's but truly whisknladle & Catania are the 2 best the Cove has to offer. The modern twist this restaurant has for Italian, makes you wanting more and anxious to come back again. Their pizzas are made in a true wood fire oven and the dough mix is amazing. No I should not be eating this many carbs, but a pizza is a must. Tonight we treated ourselves with the special, the Tomahawk steak. It was WELL worth price. 2-4 people could share this and a pasta or pizza and be VERY happy. And I didn't even mention their craft cocktails! Such fun names, and truly such a great balance.  Don't make the mistake to miss this restaurant for any occasion on your time in SD.\n\nOh and shout out to the bartenders who are 2 of the best in SD. Chris & Victor you made the night!", "Excellent Italian in the heart of La Jolla! Some of the best butternut squash ravioli I've ever had, with sage and balsamic glaze. We also enjoyed a poached pear wrapped in prosciutto appetizer. The staff was super friendly, and because we were celebrating the waitress gave us amaretto shots after the meal on the house.

Witness a tender scallop \u201ccooked\u201d in yuzu juice, topped with uni, spring peas, radish, pea shoots and a truffle vinaigrette.

My choices of restrooms included one with a picture of an owl and another with a picture of an owl with three leaves. I did not know which one to choose, so I chose the owl without the leaves. This, curiously, is a metaphor for my experience thus far at nightbird.\n\nAcross the board, I'd say, they just don't quite have it together. Each day apparently brings a new tasting menu at $125 a pop. Ours today included a quail egg amuse bouche, a shrimp and scallop thing, some squab, a beef dish, some grape sorbet, and a final dessert that was in fact quite tasty but hard to describe.\n\nIn terms of service, everything was just a bit off. Emerging from the very tight bar area we had to wait a bit for our table, which the hostess admittedly sweetened a bit with some complimentary ros\u00e9 bubbly. Upon arriving at our table we find napkins just a tad too small to fit comfortably on one's lap.\n\nIn general I found it to be an uneven experience that just wasn't worth the price.", "Had a most lovely mid-week dining experience at the opening week of this new restaurant. I arrived a little early, so I walked back to Linden Room and had a nicely crafted cocktail before diving into the five-course tasting menu. The quail egg amuse bouche was a nice opening for what was yet to come, and like most of the dishes, I felt like I could devour five more of what I was tasting.  Everything was beautiful, nuanced and delicious, but the true stand out [to me] for this week's menu was the corn prepared three ways! I'm sorry that I've forgotten our server's name, but he was very nice and attentive.  The space is small but modern, open and comfortable. An especially nice touch was when Fernet Itsits came with our check. Chef Kim Alter was also gracious enough to chat with us at the end of the night and pose for a photo. I'm already looking forward to checking out future weekly themes at this restaurant.", "I've been a huge fan of Kim Alter from her time at Haven and Plum in Oakland.  If you were able to eat at those restaurants you were very lucky, because back in those days you got the same amazing food for amazingly reasonable prices.  Even at a higher price point, Nightbird manages to still feel like a steal!\n\nKim Alter's menus are like a symphony (Mahler, perhaps?).  There is a subtle creativity and depth so far beyond the Lazy Bears of SF cuisine it's amazing people still talk about that place.\n\nSo many other reviews have photos and descriptions of the food, so if you want detail read those.  The best option is to not see the menu and be surprised at what is coming next. Also, make sure to get the wine pairing, it's absolutely inspired.\n\nI can't wait to return.  Best meal I've had in years.", "Six of us dined here almost two weeks ago and my companions and I are still talking about the delicious tasting menu. We had craft cocktails first in the cozy Linden Bar, followed by dinner. The thoughtfulness of each presentation was amazing and we talked more about the food than our usual conversation, the dining experience dominated the evening. The wine paring was also delightful and information was shared expertly but without pretension. My favorites were the quail egg in a leek nest, french white asparagus with caviar and the rabbit, served with smokey grits and enhanced with a lovely nasturtium.  The ambiance is just right  and the service was impeccable.  Looking forward to a return visit with new seasonal selections.", "Nice atmosphere overall, but something seemed lacking to elevate it to provide the feeling that you are about to have a stellar 5-course Prix Fixe meal.  \nIt is definitely loud, to the point that the music is often drowned out.\nThe service was very professional but lacked a little warmth or excitement about the food one is about to eat.\nThe dishes were ok.\nThe first course was rather cold, hiding some of the flavor of the dish (which looks to have needed some salt to bring out flavor as well.\nThe second course was good.\nThird was ok, but did not cause any excitement\nFourth was good, but nothing that one could not get elsewhere.\nFifth, dessert was an interesting attempt of being unique but missed the mark.\nMost of the wines were nice and paired well.\nAt $500+ for 2, it just did not live up to expectations. Outside of the 2nd course and some good wine, there were no dishes that created the desire to come back and do it again - hence the 3 stars.  \nHopefully, things will turn around for them as Petite Cern is just down the street and there are too many other options in the city to choose from.", "Great spot for Valentines Day!

The scallops, squab, oyster & caviar, beef tenderloin were all amazing. The dessert had a cute name -- the birds and the bees. It was a nice assortment of flavors and ice cream on top of meringue.\n\nThe chef came out briefly towards the end to provide a few take-home desserts. It was great to see her.", "Amazing.  Kim Alter and team have outdone themselves on an almost pop-up themed menu, in a tastfully decorated venue with an amazing bar.      Menu changes daily.

We started with the burrata and wild strawberries (so balanced and fresh) and the farro salad with pistachios and mint (unique mix of falvors), both of which were excellent summertime dishes.  We then tried 2 pastas as an intermezzo, the tagliatelle with morrels (awesome flavor and al dente) and the parpadelle with lamb ragu (ok but nothing special), of which I would recommend the tagliatelle.

I was extremely surprised. The octopus has this pur\u00e9e with a lemony kick which was just delightful. The heirloom salad had these buttery greasy delicious croutons and pancetta crisps that were a great combination with the strawberries. The corn was crack. Buttery crack.\n\nEntrees- chittarra Nero and the rabbit for me. The place does use a lot of pancetta and bacon which add to the salt factor. May throw some off but I love sodium so it all worked for me.\n\nService was very attentive and my wine glass was always full.

The duck was cooked perfectly, it was tender and went so well with the julienned scallions. Also I loved the peppers on the side you can add to the dipping sauce to bring the dish some heat. The udon noodles were thick and bouncy and the dipping sauce held onto the noodles really well too.", "We came to hanon after seeing that they have recently received a Michelin star. We didn't make reservations since we thought it was a Wednesday evening and that there wouldn't be a wait. We did however waited about 15 minutes which was not bad at all.\n\nI would pass on the spicy karrage as it was too oily for my liking. The tako and avocado salad was refreshing.\n\nWe ordered the kamoten seiro with half green tea udon and the regular udon. It came with yuzu kosho, which is  spicy paste made with chili peppers and yuzu peels. This definitely complimented the duck and the tempura was perfect.\n\nThe tan tan udon looks like it's something new on the menu and it comes with braised pork belly. I think it was pretty good and not too spicy. The udon was an interesting flat shape and had great texture.\n\nWe enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back to try their rice bowls and other cold udon options too! :)\n\nAs we we're having our meal, there were lots of people coming in asking for tables so I'll recommend making a reservation if you can.", "Very small space, but the most legit udon I've had. Their udon is made in shop every morning before they open, and the staff here is so friendly. The space is very clean, and honestly, it's a very good, quick lunch. I haven't been here for dinner, but they have the same menu. I like the duck dipping udon with tempura set, and they are very conscious of allergies (I have a crustacean allergy, so they were able to substitute the shrimp tempura with fish cake tempura!) upon eating, so that's something I really look for service-wise.\n\nThis is the only location in the US, and therefore, they have made a lot of efforts to be presentable and have great service. I've only had the duck udon and the uni parmesan udon, and both were excellent. There are so many different flavors to try, so I'd recommend either.", "Chilly windy night + warm bowl of noodles = heaven. This place is a haven. The backyard outdoor seating was well spaced out and romantically lit and they give wipes before the meal to clean your hands. We felt super safe!  \n\nFor appetizers, we got the spicy karaage and the shishito peppers. The karaage was some of the best fried chicken we've ever had. For the entree, I got the tantan udon which was a delicious spicy sesame hot soup with braised pork and an egg on top. The noodles were so tender and the pork was so soft. Highly recommend!", "3.5/5\nIt's always nice to see restaurant that only specializes in a few items. Hanon is no exception. They offer authentic Japanese udon with plenty of variety. The duck broth was filled with umami and I love dipping the udon into the piping hot soup. However I was expecting the noodles to be a bit chewier rather than soft especially they made them in house. The tamago egg has a nice branding on it which is a nice touch. And a strong dashi taste. The ambience is great and relaxing. Service is great. I would love to try their summer udon once the summer hits! Hopefully getting a better texture with the cold udon."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanon-brooklyn?hrid=E6nOcEQ-zB7luZbI2WdqaQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanon-brooklyn?hrid=FGldV6RqohZouNVJdnPBdw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanon-brooklyn?hrid=ZGs38hv-id9RDTUbbTIQ7w&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanon-brooklyn?hrid=Xo--sMqb9Ph6e21ZRF2XEw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanon-brooklyn?hrid=9IQMbZXi9Jy2Fl8bRb_gNg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanon-brooklyn?hrid=dY3Y4jjelGMGRHHrnBBe7A&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/hanon-brooklyn?hrid=bRdjhUucU61-AYh5VV59mQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Pastis", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/pastis-new-york-3/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/new-york-state/new-york/restaurant/pastis67390", "michelin_pov": "Manhattan hot spots come and go (even more rapidly in the trendy Meatpacking District) but Pastis 2.0 is one watering hole that still glows anew.

The broth was the most delicious blend of white wine, garlic, butter and lemon. And every single mussel had absorbed these delicious flavors. I could've eaten two bowls of this.

Profiteroles for dessert - light with just the right amount of sweetness with the chocolate and ice cream. Delicious, get it!\n\nAnd last but not least, service. Our server Joseph was delightful.

I had the moul\u00e9s frites and she had the omelette with a salad (which she can't stop raving about the dressing). For dessert, we share a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and a chocolate mousse(which could have used some cream to offset the richness) and they even put a cute little candle on my plate.

The decor inside was modern with a rustic twist with an intimate vibe. They had music playing and the crowd was buzzing. I was shocked to see such a good crowd since Pastis is fairly new. It was a pleasant surprise to see life back in the MPD! To be honest I haven't seen a restaurant this busy down there since 2013.\n\nTo start, we ordered half a dozen oysters and escargot with a glass of ros\u00e9. The escargot was buttery with a little bit of garlic. I haven't eaten escargot since I was in Paris, but Pastis absolutely perfected this dish! Escargot is delicious when it's done right.\n\nI had the steak sandwich and my sister had the Croque Monsieur. We shared with each other - the portions are decently sized. As a die hard carnivore, the steak sandwich is a MUST.\n\nOur server, Clark, was knowledgeable and kind.

Prices were fair.  Pate was excellent but French butter was a strange accompaniment, we thought it was cheese at first.  Crab fris\u00e9e, hanger steak, and salmon were good, not great.  Don't know why hanger steak is on every menu.  It's flavorful but very tough and needed something else (salsa verde?).  Salmon was perfectly cooked but over salted and needed something more satisfying than cucumber and grapefruit salad.  Skate was a big miss.  Very mushy with bones left in and unappetizing appearance.  Don't skip the bread, it's excellent.  We wanted a rose but we tested less expensive rose and it was too light and uninteresting.  Next one was $80 which is steep for rose.  3 for food and wine and 4 for both service and atmosphere.", "It took us a while to try Pastis 2.0. The rehab is concluding and one of the best Meatpacking streets is coming back to life. We were there for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. It was about 3/4 full and we were able to walk in and get a good table without a reservation. We had a great waiter and terrific service. We selected a bottle of white wine from their varied wine list and each had chicken pillared.

For the Original Style order, the exception is that the heat scale applies to spiciness based on black peppers and not Szechuan/Thai spices like the other signature bowls with the red soup. If you are having a not so good day or want to carb load, this ramen joint is great comfort food.

All flavors can come with or without broth and come on a 6 pt spiciness scale (standard is 3). One bummer is the toppings - $1.50 for a poached egg, $4 for chashui, and $1 for cilantro - kind of a rip. Otherwise, the noodles were delicious. I got to sample a bit of all three and I can say that all the broths were very flavorful. Portion sizes were decent as well. I'd say original was my favorite, followed by Downtown and Tokyo. The spice levels are legit - we got a 6 and it was filled with lots of fresh chilis - good stuff. Overall, Killer Noodles is a solid new noodle option on Sawtelle.

HH was still in effect, so we opened up with some chicken karaage - fresh out of the fryer, lightly battered, super juicy!\n\nWe tried both the \"Tokyo\" and \"Downtown\" styles, both plentiful in heat and the former having a distinctly nutty component from the incorporating of peanut butter that jived very well with the sesame.

At Killer Noodle, you'll find three types of noodles, that either come with or without broth depending on your preference. The Tokyo style is heavy and each spoonful of broth will slam your taste buds with heavy sesame, peanut, and garlic flavors. The Downtown style is a little lighter but still flavorful. After you choose your type of noodle, you choose your spicy level (1-6). They recommend 3, but if you're a big fan of spicy foods, level 6 is not bad though the numbing spice will catch up to you over time. On each table, there are also additional spice grinders, vinegar, and this sweet soy-based sauce.

My point is this, Craft was the place to dine in 02 and while it's certainly still among the better places out there, it has been passed by better restaurants with more innovative foods at the price.  Save your money and go somewhere else.", "What a lovely place for a \"treat yourself\" kind of night! They were kind and accommodating from the moment we arrived. Hats off especially to our server Mes. After we placed our orders, the chef sent shots of tomato, cucumber, and basil gazpacho out for us to accompany our bread. It was delicious - rich and creamy with a slight kick. For the main meal, I ordered the corn agnolotti with leek and winter truffle. Chose it based on the recommendation from the waiter. It was both sweet and savory, and not too heavy but still quite satisfying. My friend ordered the pork belly and upon his first bite, said it might be one of the best bites of food he's ever had. The staff also brought out an arugula and pine nut salad with a lemon dressing, which made a nice complement to the meal. For dessert, my friend ordered the strawberry Bavarian cream pie, which was beautiful to look at (though not my personal taste), and I ordered the cinnamon cardamom donuts, which were fresh, airy, and delightful. Prior to leaving, we were each gifted a blueberry muffin to take home, which seemed a bit random, but an appreciated gesture nevertheless. Will be making it a point to come back here!", "What a great dining experience.  I had been wary of going here ever since it lost it's Michelin star, but had a business dinner planned, and figured, why the hell not?\n\nIt was amazing.  The food was lovely, the drinks very good as well (and flowing very freely at this dinner...).  What stood out the most was the easy, attentive service.  The waitstaff was super knowledgeable about the menu and very accommodating to our large party.\n\nMost memorable moment: we had the Ricotta Cavatelli with corn and truffles.  A party in my mouth.  Truffles may be an easy way to get to me, but Colicchio deserves credit for trotting out those truffles...we even ordered a second plate for the table. It was that good.\n\nMy memory is fuzzy about my main, mostly because the pasta blew me away (and probably the amount of wine I had).  But, I could eat that every day.  In my opinion the first courses were the most interesting, so bring a group and try a lot, it's well worth it.\n\nOh, and a week later Sam Sifton gave them 3 stars.  Looks like I'm in the know. #winning.", "This rating is honestly mostly about ambience and service.  Don't get me wrong, the food was great, but for the price and city, it had damn well better be.\n\nThe food we got was well done and perfectly executed,  from the perfectly soft yet crisp beet salad to the saut\u00e9ed shitakes, to the medium rare American wagyu (which actually did come to the table a hair on the cooler side, half way through and it seemed luke warm). But it lacked creativity and sophistication outside of the corn Brule dessert, which was amazing with a roasted peach and berries on top.\n\nBut for the lack of unique pop in the food, the ambience and service were exquisite. A beautiful blend of modern, but warm and cozy, the place just oozes sophistication and charm.  From the steam punk looking 2 story wine rack in the middle, to the natural look ceiling light eminating an identical warm glow as the candles on the table, and both shimmering reflections at you off of the brushed copper accent wall, to the sturdy hand crafted wooden tables, it just feels good to be in there.  \n\nTop it off with the helpful and attentive staff and it was a thoroughly enjoyable evening.", "WOW!  Best meal and best  service by far!  \n\nOkay, I'll admit we went with a friend who interns in the pastry dept., but the wait staff didn't know who she was.  So given the amount of food and attention was not because of her, but because of the fantastic staff at Craft.\n\nIn a group of 8, we ordered several  entrees and sides that would be just enough for our party, but for  every 3 entrees or sides, there was a complimentary dish on our table.  We vowed to save enough room for dessert, but it was pretty damn hard with all the freebies.  We finally got to dessert and again, we received several more freebies along with our order.  \n\nWe left with full bellies and sore mouths from all the eating, which eventually turned into happy smiles and thoughts of good food, good service and good company.\n\nDefinitely a must for anyone...even once!\n\nFavs (even though the menu changes seasonally):\nRissoto\nRibs\nButternut Squash (sooooo fluffy)\nPolenta\nDonut dessert\nPumpkin fritters\n\nAttire:  They accept casual, but it wouldn't hurt to wear something nice.", "This is my favorite restaurant in NYC.

The plate consisted of grapes, strawberry, dried fruit and nut bread, marmalade, and honey. My favorite cheese was the Pepato with Peppercorn. Both meats - prosciutto and salami - were delicious. Fried artichoke consisted of two crispy lightly seasoned whole artichokes served with bagna cauda. The Burrata All Amatriciana consisted of fresh burrata cheese served with heirloom cherry tomato sauce and focaccia topped with red onion marmalade and crispy prosciutto.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered a pasta entree called Cappellacci.

They were served in a garlicky brown butter sauce with raisins and garnished with sage.

I reserved through open table, upon arrival the hostess said that we were late (17 minutes) and that they do not hold reservations for longer than 15.

From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted by a smiling staff who provided multiple options for seating (inside, outside, and upstairs). What won us over was our server, Aldo, who would, with ease, navigate us through the menu while keeping our constraints (vegetarian diet, pescatarian diet, likes/dislikes of vegetables) in mind.

We shared an anti pasti (braised baby octopus + peaches salad) and pasta (homemade maltagliati, ricotta, eggplants, cherry tomato). Both delicious! The salad was light and flavorful; the pasta was luxuriously comforting and rustic -- just the right balance.\n\nExcellent and reasonable wines, too. My friend had the draft wine (yes, I said \"draft wine\"). There was only one left -- a red. Love it that they usually have prosecco on draft. I had a glass of prosecco. Perfect.\n\nFinally, I just wanted to say how I like the vibe there: it's welcoming, chic, and the food tastes like genuine Italian. Love it. It's in the neighborhood so we will be back!", "Lupo Verde is a charming Italian spot in the city that, in addition to delivering on the food front, is literally delivering during this era of covid-19. When you CAN go in person, I recommend reserving a spot if you're in need for a little escapism to a rustic Napoletano restaurant (maybe a little fancier than the real thing?), or are looking for a good date night spot. Until you can safely venture out, the food alone is worth taking out, even if you might forgo a little ambience.\n\nThe sage and short rib ravioli and the cavatelli (both of which you can order for delivery) wereboth delicious. Each pillow of tender short rib (covered in a jus) was sumptuous. The cavatelli, which felt like a simpler dish, was lighter and maybe more seasonal, with a pesto and asparagus topping. I also love the octopus they offer (at least in person)--it was really well-prepared. A glass of pinot noir was the perfect accompaniment.\n\nI really enjoy the food here, and feel it offers superb pasta dishes! That being said, it is pricier. It's not an everyday restaurant, nor do I necessarily think it is the best Italian food in the city. That being said, it is pretty darn good, and definitely worth trying!", "Stopped here in an Italian mood and got what felt to be authentic Italian food.  We had great service eating at the bar and the bartender was very helpful, knowledgeable, and personable.  The Aperol Spritz was a great way to start the meal and the Parmesan crisp topper was great on the Paccheri Campani (a bolognese-like dish).

Bear in mind this comment does not extend to the other employees as my experience has always been great after being seated. Not a good look and I hope they have come to value their customers more. This always put this spot low on my list for eating out but for convenience. Peking Duck has always been delicious when eating in. They started offering it on the take out menu and it is not the same...I mean not even close. The taste (and weirdly the color of the duck) were completely different and not in a good way. Spicy dishes are pretty good but sometimes its hard to find ingredients besides the dried hot red peppers (see Toothpick Lamb dish). Try the Sichuan Storm Fish appetizer.

Sweet, savory, salty, wrapped in crunchy bacon is pure bliss. Wood oven paella is another top choice if nothing else than for the snail boudin (sausage). The boudin is so good you don't question what it is, you just want more of it. Focaccia is a good bang for your buck and perfect to share with a group.\n\nYelp has Avec listed as French, but I more of a mediterranean vibe with a French twist. The flavors and menu items are more tapas in nature, but prepared with French techniques. Great place for a great meal at a very reasonable price point.\n\nProtip: The door is tricky (hidden in the wall) and it's a PUSH not a pull.", "Ate here sometime last year and really enjoyed my meal - good bottle of wine, pea bruschetta spread, and whole roasted fish were all delicious. And I love the atmosphere! Pretty small and a tight squeeze. Seems like one of those places that would be good for a casual/fun date night but also for a small group. I was eager to get back, but they were closed for a while. FINALLY had the chance to come back this month and wow - totally blown away. I liked Avec before, but now I absolutely love it. We had to wait a while for a table and standing room inside is extremely limited (it was one of those super cold nights in early Sept) so that was kind of a bummer. There's no true \"bar\" so there are only so many places to wait and have a drink while you wait for your table. As long as you're willing to wait, grab a drink and stand to the side, or go elsewhere until your table is ready then you will be set to go.  I can understand why some people don't like the tightly packed, almost communal style of this place - but for me, it's worth it.", "Fantastic beet salad and tabouleh. Really fresh and flavorful and well-balanced. The tabouleh was non traditional with course-cut greens and herbs, olives, quinoa and walnuts.\n\nAlso ordered the hummus and pita, which was listed on the menu with the sandwiches. It came with either chips or lentil salad and I got the lentil salad. Both were delicious, but probably better as an app than an entree. The girl I was with got the smoked salmon tartine and it looked amazing. The bread was really fresh and there was quite a bit of salmon on it.\n\nVery attentive service. A bit loud and you share a table, so not the most private/intimate.", "Located on the line of restaurants on Randolph St, Avec which means \"with\" in French is a very contemporary-minimalistic-chic place with a bar like atmosphere come dinner time. We sat at the bar to eat. The bar stretched from the front of the restaurant all the way to the back. You get to see the open kitchen and the bar in between as all the bartenders and cooks prepare your meal and drinks in front of you. We sat really close to the front where the cashier/host was. This was not ideal in the winter as the heavy wood front door partition kept opening and closing with many people coming and going. In the summer, they have patio doors that open the full front. This space reminds me of a tiny house. Everything seems to be able to double up in use and is very flexible. The food was exotic and lovely to eat. I would love coming back for more food from their ever evolving menu.", "It's with equal parts pride and shame that I can say that the manager (Liz) knows us by name.  \n\nAt this point, I have tried most of the menu.  The large plates and bruschettas change with seasonal ingredients, but the staples and stars of Avec's menu are the \"'deluxe' foccacia with taleggio cheese, truffles, ricotta, truffle oil, and herbs,\" and the \"chorizo-stuffed medjool dates with smoked bacon and piquillo pepper-tomato sauce.\"\nDrooling yet?  Me too.\n\nMy friend took a bite of the foccacia and literally screamed with delight.  That is the appropriate response I now expect from everyone who tries this for the first time.  \n\nIf you just want to wrap up the night with some tasty snacks, I'd suggest ordering some wine, the foccacia, and the chorizo-stuffed dates.  If you're going for dinner, then also order a seasonal salad, bruschetta, and the pork shoulder.\n\nThe atmosphere is pleasantly relaxed despite the upscale food.  It's also a fun place to eavesdrop or be eavesdropped on since everyone is seated at a table that is nearly continuous from end-to-end of the restaurant.  But rubbing elbows with strangers doesn't bother me when my mouth is full of delicious.", "Wow great food, cool decor.  I was there Tuesday 11/2.  I came to this restaurant solo and got seated right away... who says you shouldn't eat alone?  Big fan of the chorizo stuffed dates and the apple salad.  I make a hell of a chorizo stuffed date and found myself taking a couple notes on how to enhance my recipe.  Since it was just me I couldn't try everything, but I assure you I was stuffed by the time I left this place.  \n\nAvec is missing one star for two very good reasons:  \n\n1) The waiting area sucks!  What the hell were you guys thinking?  It felt like a mosh pit.  Either you wait out in the cold, get slammed into by the door, or are breathing on someone as you who is trying to eat their dinner.  There is no way not to be in the way!  It would have been -2 stars but I got seated in 5 minutes.  \n\n2)  The server behind the bar was clueless - a brown haired guy who was super inattentive and had a personality like a rock.  He needs to be demoted to a bus boy and the bus boy who was both attentive and fun to banter with should be the server.  Management take note.  Normally 2 issues = -2 stars, but the food was that good.", "Really delicious lunch-sweet potato salad & salmon with brussels sprouts & plum dessert!  The flavors are incredible!

Stupak is also a serious pastry chef and his talent shows in desserts, like the \"avocado.\"", "yelp_reviews": ["This was the restaurant I've been waiting for - an innovative, Mexican-inspired spot with amazing desserts to boot!\n\nI was, like many others, first drawn to this place by the infamous avocado dessert. The dessert itself lives up to the hype, and is certainly worth trying while you're here! It's masterfully crafted to look pretty much exactly like a real avocado, but it's reminiscent of a key lime pie in both taste and texture. It also comes served on a bed of fresh lemon sorbet!\n\nThe rest of the food here is amazing, as well, with some creative takes on classic tacos. My favorite is the hash brown taco - a must have for any cheat day meal!\n\nI ordered the sweet potato cappaletti for my main entree the last time I was here, and it was one of the best and most unique pasta dishes I've had in a while! The sauce has a bit of a spicy kick, but it works very well with the sweet potato pasta and mushrooms!\n\nHighly recommend this spot for any occasion; it is also close enough to the theater district for a pre-show meal!", "Empellon is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The food here is great - you can tell by the amount of work and creativity the chef puts in to his food.  What I love is that the food keeps evolving and there are always new dishes to try.  It's very easy to keep going back - it's familiar, but also with new touches to the menu.  Besides the food, the service is on-point and the space is fun - you can watch the chefs in the kitchen, there's a mural adjacent to the bar and the chef has interesting sculptures on the first floor.  \n\nMy favorite savory dishes here are the crab nachos, lettuce leaves with verde mousseline, sticky rice tamal, sea bream and crispy pork belly.  The avocado dessert gets a love of instagram love, but my favorite desserts are the banana ice cream and corn ice cream tacos.  \n\nHighly recommended.", "If you're looking for Mexican in Midtown, Empell\u00f3n is a welcome alternative to Dos Caminos as it offers up better food, equally as strong margs, and an overall classier experience. The food here is really good but you'll have to wait in a very crowded, very loud bar area to get to said food and then eat in a very crowded, very large banquet seating area. So you better be comfortable yelling at your dining companion, because no matter what time of day you come here, it will be crowded and loud.\n\nThe restaurant is extremely well decorated with homage paid to Dali and the Spanish surrealist movement with unexpected sculptures and a mannerist color palette. It's cool and weird but works.\n\nI love the food and would suggest starting with the salsa sampler which allows you to try about 10 different salsas ranging from baby spice to ohmygodthisishot. Something for everyone. Get any and all of the tacos and round out the meal with an order of Brussels sprouts.\nI'm sure I'll be back to Empell\u00f3n as it's such a nice change from the normal Midtown steakhouse. And most importantly, their margaritas are killer.", "Found!\nStraight from the West and East Village comes this lively and innovative Mexican spot. Founded by Chef Alex Stupak who was the pastry chef at WD-50 (the Goldman Sachs of chef training programs); he certainly has an appreciation for the drama of food without losing sight of the flavor. Lunch provided a nice introduction to the menu and atmosphere, whereas after work and dinner are much more crowded. They have an extensive Mezcal menu which I will have to come back for!\nFore more great reviews of the New & Authentic visit TheLoupe!", "Although it took 30 minutes post our reservation time to be seated, the service we experienced was very attentive.  The bi-level space and open-kitchen are bright, modern, expansive and, most importantly, outfitted with acoustics that allow for audible conversation!\nOf the array of items we tried, my favorites were: Perfectly-crafted margaritas, fish tacos, chips and salsa sampler, and the sticky rice tamales.  \nWhile I love traditional fideo, I found the cotija cheese in this version to be too pungent/overwhelming.  The octopus in the tacos was cooked perfectly and much better on its own/minus the tortilla.", "After seeing the three star review in the New York Times, I made a reservation at Empellon Midtown. I am not sure what the critic was smoking, but three stars this restaurant is not. Even one star is a bit of a stretch. Upon entry, our table was not ready at the appointed reservation time. We had to wait for 20 minutes with no place to sit -- except at the bar for a cocktail. There was no attempt to rush the process or offer a glass of wine while they asked us to wait. After we sat down, they rolled in (literally) three new tables for people who never arrived. Who is managing this place? The starter tacos were at best, acceptable. Two small bites, $16. The main courses were a mixed bag with the corn dish ($29) quite tasty and satisfying and the sea bream ($34) not successful at all. We did not stay for desserts. The restaurant is very noisy, with load thumping music. My saffron cocktail ($16) was pleasant and interesting. Perhaps the cocktails are the thing to order here.", "This was a great place for drinks!  It is pricey on the food side! Bar staff is great they are fast and attentive.

The petit bouillabaisse begins as a saffron fish broth with a red-peppery North African accent to elevate the traditional fish and seafood dish. Their cassoulet is a beloved Toulousaine version with duck confit, bacon, cannellini beans, herbs and luscious pork. Finally, brioche pudding conjures all that is simple and good in a dessert, with cr\u00e8me anglaise, berries and whipped cream.", "yelp_reviews": ["French classics are the centerpiece of the menu at Le Gigot, a quaint restaurant with a Parisian neighborhood feel set on charming Cornelia Street in the West Village.  \n\nAt first glance the seating looks very tight, but somehow the restaurant manages to make the most of limited space. We've sat directly across from the bar, where tables for two are seated on the same side of booth seating, and we've also sat at a table for two towards the back of the restaurant.  In both cases, although not spacious, we never felt as if we were too close to our neighbors or that the atmosphere wasn't conducive to a private conversation.\n\nDishes we've tried have included the Boeuf Bourguignon - a thick, comforting and tender beef stew layered with tons of flavor - as well as the Duck confit, which was delicious as well.  I'd highly recommend the Brioche Pudding for dessert, which we shared and was a perfect cap to the meal.\n\nOther French staples are all here, including Coq Au Vin as well as the namesake Gigot d'Agneau, a sliced leg of lamb which is a popular choice.  For the look and feel of small neighborhood spot in Paris with the French staples you'd expect, perfect for a date night or small family dinner, Le Gigot won't disappoint.", "Nice little quaint bistro with some well prepared classics, bouillabaisse,  canard,  cassoulet,\nboeuf bourguignon are on their menu.\n\nWhat makes this place stand out is the provencal gigot and flageolets on their menu,  a rare find in New York.  The leg of lamb is nicely roasted pink served with a lucsious sauce with hints of anis, garlic and herbs then garnished with some perfectly al dente jumbo  beans.\n\nDecor and ambience are very charming and cosy , great for a romantic date due  to the small size of those homey  types of restaurants . Bar is convivial with a great selection of wines by the glass and armagnacs.\n\nService is casual but precise and friendly,  and prices are affordable...\n\nThis place is a genuine french bistro and the cooking  stands out from the tourists traps in this neighborhood, the location is conveniently a stone throw from the Blue Note.\n\nSo if you scored some seats at the Blue Note,  this is a great place to bring a date for pre or post sets ...", "Had lunch recently at this charming, french restaurant with friends. The food was carefully prepared. My favorite dish is Bouillabaisse which Le Gigot is known for. The saffron broth was rich and complimented the fresh fish and seafood. Of course the accoutrements of cheese, toast and garlic mayonnaise further enhanced this exquisite dish. My friends had crab cakes and soft shell crabs all quite pleased with their choices. Finally, the Brioche with Anglaise cream was heavenly.\nI highly recommend this cozy, special restaurant if you appreciate the subtleties of french cuisine.", "Unfortunately this place was really rather forgettable for me. I came here for dinner and was happy to be seated immediately. They have both indoor and outdoor spaces - unfortunately outdoor is on the pavement and the claxophony of cars doesn't help with the experience.\n\nNotwithstanding we tried the crab cake and the bouillabaisse. The crab cake was good and it was only crab meat with no fillers.\n\nUnfortunately a very forgettable meal for me.\n\nI came here for dinner. We were seated outdoors immediately. They have some indoor seating - about 8 tables mostly for couples. Outside they have about 5 tables in the summer.\n\nThe service was relatively slow and since the menu didn't have too many options I was hoping all the food that they did they would do well. From menu to leaving we ordered about 3 dishes and it took 2.5 hours.\n\nAt best the food was fresh but it wasn't either tasty or memorable. It didn't have either flavor complexity or interest in terms of ingredient combination. I would probably come here for a basic meal but at the prices I expected something a little more upscale I suppose. We tried the heirloom tomato salad, the crab cake and the ravioli.\n\nI would pass on this place for dinner - might be a better lunch option to be fair", "My wife and I had an intimate dinner for two on a cold snowy night here in December. We opted to sit at the side by side tables and it was very romantic. Perfect for a date night.\n\nOur waiter was helpful and attentive. The restaurant is small so he was able to spot everything and was there to fill up our wine glasses every time they looked a little low.\n\nFood was AWESOME. It was a cold and snowy night so we both opted to start off with French onion soup (vegetarian broth). I'm a big fan of French onion soup and this was some of the best we've ever had.

Of the meats I sampled, the brisket and pulled pork were two must-repeats, though the stuffed sausage was delicious as well. Pile these on piece of Texas toast with a bit of onion, mac and cheese, and Carolina sauce, and you've got a glorious little barbecue bite! The mac and cheese on its own is enough to break the resolve of a stoic lactose intolerant bbq enthusiast, but the brussels sprouts were really phenomenal (perhaps equal to, if not better than, the sprouts you'd find at an objectively fancier spot in the city).\n\nThe earlier you go, the more likely you are to have the full menu at your disposal, as they run out of offerings as the day does on.

To share we ordered the Texas Ranger sandwich (brisket base), as well as the 2 step with pork shoulder, jalapeno sausage, mac & cheese and brussel sprouts. The brisket was a standout of the meats, but they were all tender and delicious. I had heard some differing opinions on their sides, but both of ours were great. The mac & cheese is made with Gouda, and you could taste the extra spices they put into it. The brussel sprouts were crispy all the way through (the best way to eat them) and were perfect with the Sticky Garlic sauce.\n\nWill definitely be back to try more of the meats and sandwiches.", "Hands down, best BBQ in the DMV area.  \n\nYou'll need to run a 10K after coming here, but it's worth every calorie.  The place is easy to miss since the tin american flag shingling on the outside blends in with the surrounding brick buildings.  There's a neon pig above the door as an identifier and the mural inside adds to the charm.  \n\nBack in the day, my S.O. and I frequented DC smokehouse on florida ave.

He was going here once a week all summer and I had never heard of it. This month, I gave in and tried it out! I had high expectations and they were met!\n\nI came on a Friday evening after work, before a show at Potter's house (next door). All of the tables inside were full but there was space outside for me to slip between two groups at a communal picnic table.\n\nAs I had never been here before, I asked the staff for a recommendation.

I'm surprised more bbq joints don't have an open sink.", "The food was okayyy I like the pork and the turkey. The brussel sprouts were mostly flakes. The water situation was really disappointing. Tiny tiny cups and the food hot so really do need water. It was also super cramped and dirty with a really long line and almost no seats. So I was being bumped into by this guy th whole time. Then a worker came and was like are you done? Do you need anything else? Are you done? This was one second after we finished eating. Imo employees do not have the right to rush paying customers out... And we had only been there for like 15 minutes.

Its tropical vibe makes the perfect backdrop for Chef Stephanie Izard\u2019s wonderfully inventive pan-Latin cooking, which she punches up with global touches pulled from her diverse culinary background.\nThe menu may lean Peruvian, but it also offers such favorites as ceviches, empanadas, botanas, and anticuchos. The kitchen takes liberties with traditional tastes, producing dishes that celebrate the area's vibrance and bounty. To wit: salmon ceviche with pistachio, avocado, and leche de tigre; as well as chicharr\u00f3n del puerco with pickled vegetables and apple salad. Cool off with a swirl of coconut- and quinoa-topped vanilla soft-serve.", "yelp_reviews": ["Great views, great food, great vibes. The staff was hospitable and accommodating. I'd recommend going in the summer and trying to get a patio seat. Alternatively, it looks like they cover the patio in winter and heat the area with patio heaters. Regardless, you get a great view of the south/southwest city overlooking Randolph and beyond.\n\nEnter in through the Hoxton hotel lobby, and take a left to the elevators. It's Peruvian-inspired, so expect heat and acidity to be at the forefront. Have gone a few times now, and our recurrent favorites are as follows:\n-Salmon Ceviche, which pack a punch of acidity that goes incredibly well with the fresh salmon flavor\n-Solterito, with its fresh vegetable and fruit crunch that help to take the edge off the fat from the delectable fried cheese\n-Steak Saltado, because it's steak\n-Chicharron Del Puerco, a large portion that's probably about 3 (other) plates large. The crispy pork skin goes incredibly well with the pork meat and fat underneath. It's complimented by slices of salted pita bread and several sauces, as well as a strawberry salad and corn elote.\n\nProbably one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Looking forward to going back again, maybe for brunch next time.", "Our visit visit to Cabra did not disappoint. Celebrated Top Chef victor and Chicago restauranteur Stephanie Izard has delivered yet another winning format in the West Loop. Situated atop the Buxton Hotel, Cabra Cevicheria provides The Windy City with Chef Izard's take on Peruvian cuisine. The dishes are offered in a tapas style with most being dished for table sharing. From beginning to end, we were tantalized with bold and fresh flavors. The cold crab Causa started us on the epicurean journey with solid umami. The salmon ceviche was unctuous and acidic. The smoked goat empanadas delivered a rustic and flavorful experience. We were completely knocked over by the sticky rice Arroz con Plato with a perfectly prepared duck leg. And to finish with the soft serve mango swirl left us completely satisfied. The service was impeccable. Our server Brendan was exceptionally\nKnowledgeable about the menu and helped us craft a fantastic course experience. Even 3 days into opening, Cabra receives no questionable marks from me. Looking forward to returning next week so that I can experience more of the cuisine.", "We were really excited to finally get a reservation at Cabra!  We were not disappointed! It is a beautiful space and we had such great service.  I will say it can be very noisy but we were definitely contributing to that noise. We started with the classic, shrimp, salmon and snapper ceviche, with the classic and shrimp being my favorites. They are\nsmall portions so if there are a lot of people, you may want to order a few. We also loved the Yuca Fritas and the pumpkin empanandas. The highlight for me was the chicharr\u00f3n del puerco. The pork was just falling off of the bone. It was SO good! We ended with three desserts (there were six of us) and my absolute favorite was the Mango Mint. It was so refreshing and it had a delicious chocolate crumble on the bottom. Make sure you get the picarones which were sweet potato donuts. They sit in this dulce de leche base which is amazing. I will for sure be returning!", "Overall: 4.3/5\nCame here for a restaurant week-end brunch. I chose the surf and shitos menu for my table.\n\nTaste: 4.5/5. Wow. What a delight. I was not expecting the tuna quinoa salad to be as good as it was. The star of the meal. It was the perfect amount of crunchy quinoa to marinated tuna to honey roasted pecans and veggies. The classic ceviche was good as well, a little sour, but nice. The roe and veggie omelette was very tasty as well with very buttery eggs and nice roe flavor that popped against the leche de tigre. The weakest dish was probably the shishito peppers--there was one pepper that was unbearably spicy--the others were not spicy.\n\nValue: 3.8/5 normally, but like 4.5/5 for RW deal. It's a fancy restaurant so dishes are usually roughly $14 each. Restaurant week deals are so good though. I'd go for RW again, not sure about normally though.\n\nSpeed: 4.8/5. Food came out fast.\nAmbience: 4.9/5. A light filled roof of the Hoxton hotel. Beautiful especially during the day!\nService: 3.8/5. Servers checked in a couple times but weren't super proactive in stuff like filling water.\n\nOverall great restaurant week experience. What a delight to my tastebuds.", "The ambiance is cool and chic. The atmosphere is relaxed but with a busy vibe. The brunch food is amazing with some of the most rich, unique, flavorful tastes a I've ever had. Crab cauza was sublte, flavorful with three or four tastes popping on and off my tastebuds from vinegary sweet pickled vegetables to creamy, mustardy avocado and taste crab. The Shrimpy Tacu Tacu was AMAZING! I'll come back for sure.", "Cabra is a gorgeous rooftop restaurant at The Hoxton hotel in the West Loop. It is chef Stephanie Izard's latest venture and I think she does it well. The fruit ceviche was refreshing and I especially love that she used dragon fruit. The salmon hash was excellent and the Peruvian toast the perfect sweet treat at the end of our meal. The space itself is pleasing to the eye, filled with plants, floor to ceiling windows, and beautiful decor. Our service was exceptional and genuinely friendly.\n\nI will definitely return", "Every option we chose was so delicious!\nOnly complaint we had was the the serving size for the price.\nWe did not leave a crumb!\n\nIt's beautiful inside.\nWe unfortunately didn't get outdoor seating but it was still a site to be in."], "yelp_review_ids": ["https://www.yelp.com/biz/cabra-chicago-2?hrid=zJOSx2s2EIpONkhqGswMBA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cabra-chicago-2?hrid=VecWt3JCrsTtYFHoLz8vMg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cabra-chicago-2?hrid=QR75b1sTfKPL5IHuSz4cjw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cabra-chicago-2?hrid=Bux6fYXf_YG5t74GoiMImA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cabra-chicago-2?hrid=8rab6MsSabOgaMgUY8MTGg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cabra-chicago-2?hrid=_V0NivbLVa8ug1PCkBsrfA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)", "https://www.yelp.com/biz/cabra-chicago-2?hrid=BZMM1jw-Pp041xqAX7PGow&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)"]}, {"restaurant": "Yue Huang", "yelp_url": "https://yelp.com/biz/yue-huang-sacramento-2/", "michelin_url": "https://guide.michelin.com/en/california/us-sacramento/restaurant/yue-huang", "michelin_pov": "Surrounded by a number of standard-issue chain eateries in a Natomas shopping center, this Cantonese restaurant is a hidden treasure.

However, diners are bound to also run across a range of more interesting items, like succulent sticky-rice shrimp balls or steamed buns stuffed with crunchy walnuts and sweet red bean paste.", "yelp_reviews": ["Finally stopped in for Dim Sum last Saturday and this place really nice and fancy inside. There is a wall of glass cases with different wines displayed inside as you walk in that definitely catches your eye. To my surprise, it wasn't really busy inside, as the restaurant was maybe less than half full on a Saturday at noon. We were the only people waiting for a table and was ask to wait about five minutes before getting seated, there was three of us.\n\nI mainly came to try the Dim Sum and we did ordered black bean steam oysters off the menu. There was maybe two Dim Sum carts that came by, the same Dim Sum cart came by a couple of times. We tried maybe six items including: taro cake, chicken feet, egg tarts, and BBQ baos. They tasted good and fresh but I'm disappointed by the limited choices. There wasn't much to choose from and they kept pushing around the same items. We did receive good service and the oysters we ordered were good so that's a plus. We were told that they are better for dinner so we will come back and try the dinner. If you are looking for a fancy Chinese restaurant in Natomas, this is your place. The food is good, but the Dim Sum selection was a bit limited.", "This is the only dim sum option on the north side and it is delicious! Prices are higher than if you were to go down to Stockton Blvd for dim sum but it's worth it. The wait can get long at peak times but they do their best to keep the line moving. They're currently not pushing any carts around so you order your items with a server and they come out pretty quickly. The standard dumplings, har gow and siu mai, are freshly steamed and the shrimp and pork fillings are succulent and quite large. I also love the chong fun, which is a thin rice paper wrapped around shrimp, beef, veggies, or Chinese donut, and covered in soy sauce. The shrimp one is the best, trust. The fried options are also really good especially those crispy shrimp balls. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach and I end up ordering too much. Better to go in a bigger group so you can have a bite or two of everything. My favorite item is the pineapple bun with the cream filling. Omg *chef's kiss* it's so good! Better to order them early because they ran out the last time I was here. This is definitely my go-to dim sum spot and am happy I don't have to drive to south sac to get it.", "While heading thru Sacramento from Reno to pick up some items, owe stopped for some dim sum. Great stuff. They had the carts wheeling around but they also gave us a picture menu which we circled what we want. Everything came out at the same time hot and fresh.\n\nWe ordered Shui Mi, Hargow, Sticky Rice in Lotus leaves, Meatballs, Soy Sauce Chow Mein, Shrimp and Green Onion Dumplings, Soup Dumplings, Egg Custard Buns and much much more.\n\nEverything was great but the real interesting ones for me was a Fried Sticky Rice dish. It was sticky rice with Chinese sausage, egg, fried shrimp and more prepared like fried rice. The Bean Curd wrapped minced shrimp was excellent (it's my favorite thing to order at dim sum). My daughters order of Orange Chicken was extremely good and was a nice portion size.\n\nThey have an extensive Chinese menu which even though they have American Chinese staples they also have a lot of authentic Chinese dishes (Cantonese style) which I'm excited to try the next time we are in Sacramento. Service was great and even thought they were busy we never had to ask more then once for anything. It definitely will be a place I go to again.", "This was our first visit have dim sum  in Yue Huang. It was very delicious!\nYou can always tell how good a restaurant is by the clientele. Many real Chinese patrons were dining here, so we knew it had to be pretty good!\nI took some photos of what we had.\nThe staff are polite, friendly and accommodating.  This restaurant is very clean and inviting.\nEach dim sum cart has so many varieties of dim sum to choose from.\nWe also had congee. (Scallops with green onions and Fried donut) Wonderful!  \nThe prices are fair! I would highly recommend Yue Huang to all my friends!\nThe tea is served in a nice pot, clear, so you can see what is inside.  \nThis restaurant is very busy on the weekends. Today is Thursday, and we were seated at noon easily, although there were many other diners. This is my favorite dim sum place now!!", "Went for dim sum and service, ambience, portions of dishes were very good.  However dishes like har gow, fried shrimp balls, beef noodle rolls, siew Mai, and black bean spare ribs were ok. Better tasting dim sum at HK islander.  What shocked us was the bill was because 7 standard dishes for two people came up to 40.00. Most expensive dim sum place in Sacto.  Not worth the drive to Natomas but maybe worth it for dim sum lovers who live in that area. We will stay with our dim sum places closer to Freeport Blvd or South Sacramento which have more reasonable prices and better tasting dim sum.", "Come here for: classic Chinese family style cuisine, great example of Chinese food in America. Not heavily oiled or sugared\n\nFood: very traditional southern Chinese. I really like the stuffed tofu and salt baked shrimp. If crab is in season they do it well\nService: always nice friendly and accommodating\nDecor: a bit odd, inside it's your classic heavy drape weirdly overdone Chinese restaurant but outside it still looks like the Johnny carinos it used to be.
